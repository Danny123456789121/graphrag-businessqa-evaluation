            "question": "How can SAP leverage insights from the Sustainable HRM research (Mazur & Walczyna, 2020) to develop new HR solutions that simultaneously enhance employee well-being and drive corporate sustainability goals, particularly in diverse regional contexts like Podlasie?",
            "ground_truth": "SAP can leverage the Mazur & Walczyna (2020) research by developing HR solutions that address the psychological, sociological, and ecological aspects of Sustainable HRM.  For the psychological aspect, SAP can create tools and platforms that support work-life balance, employee autonomy, self-development, and career planning, aligning with the concept of 'balanced careers' and fostering employee well-being.  For the sociological aspect, SAP can build solutions promoting diversity and inclusion, addressing issues of age, gender, ethnicity, and disability, and integrating CSR initiatives into HR practices.  For the ecological aspect, SAP can develop tools for tracking and reducing the environmental impact of HR operations (e.g., reducing paper usage, promoting remote work), and integrate environmental training into employee development programs.  The regional context of Podlasie, with its unique environmental and cultural characteristics, can inform the customization of these solutions, ensuring relevance and effectiveness.  The research model proposed by Mazur & Walczyna (2020) can serve as a framework for measuring the impact of these new HR solutions on both employee well-being and corporate sustainability.",

            "question": "Considering the cognitive frames identified in Hahn et al.'s (2014) study on corporate sustainability, how can SAP design its sustainability initiatives to resonate with both 'business case' and 'paradoxical' thinking among its clients, thereby fostering broader adoption of sustainable practices?",
            "ground_truth": "SAP can design its sustainability initiatives to appeal to both business case and paradoxical frames by offering tailored solutions. For clients with a business case frame, SAP should emphasize the financial benefits of sustainability, providing clear ROI calculations, showcasing successful case studies demonstrating cost savings and revenue generation through sustainable practices, and focusing on quantifiable metrics.  For clients with a paradoxical frame, SAP should acknowledge the inherent tensions and complexities of sustainability, offering flexible and adaptable solutions that accommodate conflicting goals, providing tools for navigating trade-offs, and emphasizing long-term value creation beyond immediate financial returns.  SAP can also develop communication strategies that resonate with each frame, using data-driven arguments for business case clients and narrative-based approaches emphasizing shared values and societal impact for paradoxical clients.  By understanding and addressing the cognitive biases inherent in each frame, SAP can increase the likelihood of broader adoption of sustainable practices.",

            "question": "How can SAP integrate the findings of Chang et al.'s (2020) study on psychological ownership and green initiatives into its product development and marketing strategies to enhance employee engagement and improve the environmental performance of its client organizations?",
            "ground_truth": "SAP can integrate Chang et al.'s (2020) findings by focusing on fostering green product psychological ownership (GPPO) among employees of its client organizations.  This can be achieved through several strategies:  (1) Product Development:  Involve employees in the design and development of green products, giving them a sense of ownership and responsibility.  (2) Marketing:  Highlight the environmental benefits of SAP's products and the role employees play in their success.  (3) Training and Communication:  Provide clear and consistent communication about the company's green initiatives and the importance of employee contributions.  (4) Recognition and Rewards:  Recognize and reward employees for their contributions to green initiatives, further strengthening their sense of ownership.  By fostering GPPO, SAP can reduce employee green confusion (EGC), increase employee environmental performance (EEP), and ultimately improve the overall environmental performance of its client organizations.  The study's findings on the mediating role of GPPO suggest that SAP's efforts to promote a green shared vision (GSV) will be more effective if they simultaneously focus on building GPPO.",

            "ground_truth": "SAP can adapt its sustainability reporting for the Chinese market by focusing on the aspects of sustainability that are most valued by Chinese financial analysts, as identified by Zhang et al. (2020).  This includes prioritizing environmental indicators related to water, effluents and waste, emissions, energy, and compliance.  In the social category, focus should be placed on customer health and safety, customer privacy, and compliance.  The reporting should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, using metrics that are readily accessible and comparable across companies.  SAP should also consider the cultural context, emphasizing the alignment of sustainability initiatives with Confucian values of righteousness and social harmony.  Given the importance of government influence in China, SAP should highlight the alignment of its sustainability practices with relevant government policies and regulations.  Finally, SAP should ensure that its reporting is credible and transparent, building trust with Chinese financial analysts and investors.",
