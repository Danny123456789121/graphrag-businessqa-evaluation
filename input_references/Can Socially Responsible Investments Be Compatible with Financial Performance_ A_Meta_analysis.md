# Can Socially Responsible Investments Be Compatible with Financial Performance?

# Abstract

This paper examines whether socially responsible investment (SRI) outperforms conventional investments by meta-analysis. The result shows that weighted average effect size is not significantly different from zero, suggesting that SRI performance is not different from conventional investments. Meta-regression results regarding sampling issues indicate that economic crisis, control group, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds are important determinants of effect sizes, and publication year, author type, and control group are important factors of the absolute value of effect sizes. Regarding methodological issues, risk adjustment, weighting scheme, data refinement, benchmark model, and matching procedure are significant factors determining the absolute value of effect sizes.

# 1. Introduction

Researchers and investors have long been curious about whether socially responsible investment (SRI) funds and portfolios financially outperform conventional ones. Early studies date back to the 1970s (Moskowitz, 1972; Alexander and ...

Buchholz, 1978), and a significant amount of research has been accumulated so far.1 However, existing evidence shows mixed results. For example, Auer (2016) shows that investors can do financially well while doing social good based on environmental, social, and governance ratings data for the European market. However, Renneboog et al. (2008a) report that the SRI funds of France, Ireland, Sweden, and Japan significantly underperform conventional funds by 4–7% per annum during the period 1991–2003. In addition, there are many other papers that report no difference in performance between SRI and conventional funds (Hamilton et al., 1993; Kreander et al., 2005; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Hoepner and Schopohl, 2018).

It is imperative to determine the overall influence of SRI on investment performance, because if the impact is positive, investors will voluntarily participate in socially beneficial investments and government does not have to intervene in the market to promote social goals. If the impact is negative, however, investors have to sacrifice their investment benefits to pursue their social preferences and the public sector has to intervene in one way or another to encourage SRI activities. The direction and magnitude of SRI influence can also have a profound implication for financial industries with respect to product development, asset management, fiduciary duty, performance evaluation, and so forth. Understanding the impact of SRI is also important to academic research. As Combs et al. (2011) point out, without a proper synthesis of existing literature more fruitful further research is difficult.

Despite this, there have been few attempts to synthesize existing literature on SRI and even these have not been successful. For example, Rathner (2013) lacks representativeness due to a small sample size and incomplete methodology. Revelli and Viviani (2015) performed a meta-analysis based on 85 studies. However, they fail to draw a sharp conclusion due to ambiguity caused by pooling several countries in one sample. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) show that culture is an important determinant of SRI influence, so combining countries with different cultural backgrounds will prevent researchers from obtaining a correct picture of SRI.2 More importantly, they analyze the impact of moderators only on effect size (hereafter, ES) ignoring the impact on the absolute value of effect size (hereafter, AES).

1 SRI is different from corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR focuses on corporate social activities and papers on CSR examine whether firms can improve financial performance by engaging in socially desirable activities. SRI focuses on investment strategies that employ various screening procedures (e.g., positive, negative, and best-in-the-class) based on so-called ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria and papers on SRI compare the investment performance of these portfolio strategies with conventional ones.

2 Moreover, their study seems to have multiple errors. For example, they include Smith (1996), which is an event study, even though they explicitly mention that they do not include event studies in the text. Gregory et al. (1997) have a Hedges’ g value of 0.24 in their Appendix, but the sign should be negative since the ethical funds performed worse than the non-ethical funds.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Although many valuable conjectures can be made regarding AES. This point is especially important in the current situation where positive and negative effects coexist, since focusing only on the level of ESs will average out positive and negative impacts leading researchers to underestimate the impact of SRI. To our knowledge, our paper is the first that investigates the influence of moderators on both ESs and AESs.

Another reason for the lack of sound summary papers is the diversity and complexity of existing studies with regard to samples, methodologies, performance measures, investment universe, benchmarks, etc. A meta-analysis is a very useful scientific tool to synthesize a wide variety of heterogeneous papers. It calculates ES that can be interpreted as a standardized difference between performances of SRI and conventional portfolios. By standardizing performance differences, whatever the performance measures, a common measure of difference between the two types of portfolios is generated, making synthesis possible across very diverse papers.

Given the situation in SRI research, this article attempts to achieve the following goals. First, we provide a sound synthesis of existing literature which shows an overall influence of SRI on investment performance in terms of sign and magnitude through a meta-analysis. Then, we examine a variety of determinants of SRI influence, since it is conceivable that the magnitude and direction of SRI effects may have a systematic relationship with sample characteristics and research methodologies. The analyses on moderators will help us to produce interesting implications for future research and practice. When performing the analysis, we carefully explain our meta-analysis and data collection process to ensure replicability.

This study is organized as follows. In the next section, we develop hypotheses regarding the overall impact of SRI and moderators that can have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. In Section 3, we explain the meta-analysis and the concept of ES and show definitions of moderators used for hypothesis testing. In Section 4, we present our sampling process in detail, since sampling is crucial in performing and interpreting a meta-analysis. Section 5 reports the meta-analysis results, and Section 6 presents conclusions and discussions.

# 2. Hypotheses

Our initial research interest is on the average impact of SRI on investment performance. Thus, we first propose a hypothesis on the overall ES and then proceed to establish hypotheses for moderators that may have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. We attempt to employ moderators to reflect research characteristics as extensively as possible based on theory and practice. We split the moderators into two broad categories: sampling and methodology. Sampling relates to data collection, and methodology is about analysis tools.

# 2.1. Overall Effect Size

The CSR literature shows that CSR firms perform better than non-CSR firms (Wu, 2006; Margolis et al., 2009). Since SRI invests more in CSR firms, the performance of SRI will be higher than conventional investments. SRI performance can also be better since SRI fund managers may have a deeper knowledge of their investment pools (Girard et al., 2007; Gil-Bazo et al., 2010). SRI screening eliminates unethical firms from the investment universe, and fund managers can focus on a relatively small number of firms. In fact, Kacperczyk et al. (2005) show that more concentrated portfolios produce a higher return than broadly diversified portfolios. SRI fund turnover is lower since SRI investors are more loyal to social values than conventional investors, and the resulting lower transaction costs also predict a better performance.

On the other hand, portfolio theory predicts an inferior performance of SRI portfolios. Other things being equal, SRI constraints on the investment universe will lead to a less favorable efficient frontier, sacrificing diversification benefits (Girard et al., 2007; Renneboog et al., 2008a). For example, excluding sin stocks can cause investors to sacrifice returns, since they generate a higher risk-adjusted return than conventional stocks (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Durand et al., 2013; Borgers et al., 2015). The higher transaction costs and management fees of SRI funds also predict an inferior performance, since they are relatively small, losing economies of scale (Bauer et al., 2005; Barnett and Salomon, 2006). Ayadi et al. (2011) find that the average expense ratio of Canadian SRI fund is 1.97%, which is much larger than the 1.29% global benchmark for conventional funds.

Finally, any impact of SRI cannot be justified theoretically. The efficient market hypothesis predicts that SRI portfolios and funds cannot produce abnormal returns, since investors and fund managers can easily replicate ethical screening procedures which are public information. Even though some SRI funds seem to outperform conventional funds, their performance superiority may vanish if transaction costs are subtracted.

On the empirical side, evidence is also mixed with positive (Hickman and Teets, 1999; Guenster et al., 2005; Brander, 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2007; Galema et al., 2008; Peiris and Evans, 2010) and negative (Mueller, 1991; Girard et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2013) impacts for SRI. In addition, there are many papers reporting no impact. For example, Kreander et al. (2005) uncover similar performances between SRI and conventional funds when they investigate the SRI funds of seven European countries. Bauer et al. (2007) examine a sample of Canadian ethical funds and again find no significant difference between SRI and conventional funds. In addition, there are still many papers that report no difference between SRI and conventional investments (Sauer, 1997; Hutton et al., 1998; Benson et al., 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Renneboog et al., 2008a; Humphrey et al., 2016). Therefore, we establish a null hypothesis on the overall effect of SRI as follows.

# Hypothesis 1.

The influence of SRI will not be different from zero.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

# 2.2. Sampling Issues

# 2.2.1. Time

Among various sampling issues that generate the SRI performance documented in many studies, the first-order effect could be caused by the change in the conceptualization of social responsibility. Over the past three decades, not only firms but also investors have changed their views on CSR. In earlier years, the CSR strategy may have been adopted by innovative firms and the SRI strategy, including these firms, may have outperformed conventional investment strategies. However, the relative advantage of SRI may have weakened over time since the uniqueness of SRI has decreased as more firms promote CSR activities. This process will lead to a lower abnormal return over time. It is also possible that investing communities will learn from academic studies. As more investors use SRI investment strategy via the learning process, the return can diminish. Consistent with this argument, Hoepner and Schopohl (2018) show that estimates for the impact of SRI become marginally significant or lose their significance over the sub-period 2008–2015 when compared with the entire sample period 2001–2015.

However, the dampening impact SRI process may not be a uniformly decreasing one, but rather alternate in sign. Research in general tends to show three dialectical stages of development (O’Connor, 2003). A thesis is posited in the beginning and it gives rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis. Finally, a synthesis resolves the tension between the two. We can expect that research in the SRI area may also follow a similar pattern. Since the merits of SRI were overemphasized in the beginning, an argument of negative impact shows up as an antithesis which is followed by a synthesis that supports no or less impact. As for the degree of fluctuation, it will decrease over time. Since methodologies have become more sophisticated over time, any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios caused by misspecification of methodologies will become smaller over time. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2-1. ESs are positive in the beginning and change signs with decreasing absolute value.

During times of economic crisis, portfolio performance reduces compared to normal periods. The SRI performance will follow a similar pattern and the ESs computed from the sample period including a crisis will be different from those in normal periods. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2-2. Papers whose sample periods include a crisis period will show smaller ESs than papers whose sample periods do not include a crisis.

# 2.2.2. Publication

One of the important considerations in meta-analysis regarding sampling is publication bias. As the phrase “Publish or Perish” signifies, publication is imperative in academia (Zivney and Bertin, 1992). Since so many papers are submitted, academic

Journals have become very selective and papers with a high statistical significance are more likely to be published than papers with insignificant results (Song et al., 2000). According to Stanley (2005), we can suspect that type II selection error, that is, a tendency to report significant results excessively, exists if the values of standardized ESs exceed 1.96 more than 5% of the time. Other things being equal, if a publication bias exists, published papers will have higher ESs, either positive or negative. In order to check whether our sample has publication bias, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 3.

The AESs for published papers will be higher than those for unpublished papers.

# 2.2.3. Author type.

Papers written by professional managers and scholars can show differences in ESs since they are quite different in various respects, including incentives for performing research. For example, Vaihekoski (2004) mentions that academic researchers are, in general, concerned with aspects related to asset pricing, whereas institutional investors are primarily interested in detecting opportunities that can generate superior risk-adjusted performance. Asset pricing is closely related to the efficient market hypothesis, and insignificant differences between SRI performances and conventional portfolios can be accepted as confirming market efficiency. However, if a large difference is found between the two performances, justification regarding the causes of the difference is often quite challenging. Among industry professionals, however, market efficiency is not accepted as a norm, so researchers from financial industries may pay more attention to finding profit potential than supporting market efficiency. Therefore, we conjecture that researchers in academia tend to find a smaller performance difference between SRI and conventional groups than industry professionals. In order to test this argument, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 4-1.

The AESs obtained by academic researchers will be smaller than those obtained by industry researchers.

It is possible that researchers in different disciplines may have different perspectives on SRI and this will lead to a systematic difference in their research outcomes. For example, researchers in the finance area may focus more on profit maximization and argue against the benefit of SRI, while researchers in other areas such as business ethics may think social benefits are more important than monetary benefits, advocating for SRI. To examine the impact of a difference in researcher perspectives on ESs, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 4-2.

The ESs of papers published in finance journals will be smaller than those published in non-finance journals.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

# 2.2.4. Control group.

Researchers compare the performance of SRI funds and portfolios with the performance of various control groups. For example, Muñoz et al. (2015) compare SRI mutual funds with conventional mutual funds, while Edmans (2011) compares SRI portfolios with market indexes. In general, the difference between SRI portfolios and market indexes is higher than that between SRI portfolios and corresponding conventional portfolios. Whereas SRI portfolios suffer from diversification loss due to screening procedures, market indexes do not. On the other hand, conventional portfolios are formed by an author(s) considering comparability with SRI portfolios. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 5-1.

The comparison between SRI portfolios and market indexes will have larger AESs than the comparison between SRI and conventional portfolios.

For the papers that use conventional market indexes as the control group, the treatment groups are either SRI portfolios or SRI indexes (Statman, 2006). In this case, the discrepancy between the two indexes, i.e., SRI and conventional, is smaller than that between SRI portfolios and conventional indexes. For example, the Domini Social Index is a leading market capitalization-weighted SRI index. It was created in 1990 by starting with the companies in the S&P 500 index, so many companies are included in both indexes (Di Bartolomeo and Kurtz, 1999; Brander, 2006). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 5-2.

The AESs will be smaller when SRI indexes rather than SRI portfolios are compared with conventional indexes.

Socially responsible investment portfolios have a less favorable risk–return trade-off due to diversification loss (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Statman and Glushkov, 2009). When market portfolios are used rather than conventional portfolios composed by researchers as a control group, the degree of diversification loss is relatively larger. This leads to the following hypothesis regarding ESs themselves.

# Hypothesis 5-3.

Experiments using market index as a control group will have smaller ESs than those using conventional portfolios as a control group.

# 2.2.5. Investment universe.

Cultural elements are important in studying the impact of SRI (Hill et al., 2007; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). Since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006), SRI funds can appeal more strongly to regions with a similar cultural background than to other countries with different cultural backgrounds. Indeed, Jones et al. (2008) find that SRI funds with a high exposure to international capital markets underperform the market by 3% per annum. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# C.-S. Kim

# Hypothesis 6.

The performance of domestic SRI funds will be better than international SRI funds.

# 2.2.6. Screening procedure.

Funds using negative screening exclude unethical firms, and sometimes even entire industries, from their portfolios, causing a sharp shrink in the portfolio frontier. Moreover, since sin stocks seem to perform better, SRI based on negative screening will result in a worse performance than conventional investment (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). This problem is less severe in the case of positive screening, since fund managers can add SR stocks to their existing portfolios. Even when SRI managers select stocks purely based on positive criteria, they may perform better than broadly diversifying fund managers since they may have an intimate knowledge of SR stocks (Kacperczyk et al., 2005; Girard et al., 2007). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 7.

Funds employing a positive screening procedure will outperform those with a negative screening procedure.

# 2.2.7. Mutual funds.

In existing literature, many authors study the performance of SRI mutual funds (Geczy et al., 2005; Chang and Witte, 2010; Climent and Soriano, 2011; Muñoz et al., 2014), while others study SRI portfolios formed by themselves (Diltz, 1995; Gompers et al., 2003; Core et al., 2006). There can be differences between the two types of research since it is well known that managed funds rarely beat the market (Jensen, 1968; Ferson and Schadt, 1996; Ferson and Warther, 1996; Carhart, 1997). In addition, funds formed by researchers do not consider market frictions such as liquidity constraints and transaction costs explicitly, which is not the case in the analysis of mutual funds (Adamsson and Hoepner, 2015). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 8.

ESs from examining SRI mutual funds will be lower than ESs from examining portfolios formed by researchers.

# 2.3. Methodological Issues

Effect sizes can also vary with methodologies employed. In particular, under efficient capital markets, there should not be a performance difference between SRI and conventional portfolios if all relevant factors are considered. However, if some important determinants are omitted by methodological misspecification, it will.

Although methodological issues exist for most asset pricing/capital market studies, they are particularly important in the meta-analysis of SRI. The result on SRI performance can be systematically different depending on the research methodologies used. Thus, investigating the impact of methodological difference on ESs from a variety of different angles can significantly enhance our understanding of SRI.

produce a spurious difference in portfolio performances. For instance, Gregory et al. (1997) reveal that the outperformance of UK SRI funds found in previous studies disappears when they improve methodology by using a two-factor benchmark to control size. In general, the more rigorous the methodologies, the smaller the possible confounding effects.

Existing literature examines various methods of controlling for these problems, and this paper categorizes these into three groups, that is, variable adjustment (e.g. risk adjustment, value-weighting, splits and dividends adjustment), refining benchmark model (e.g. multi-factor model, conditional model), and matching.

# 2.3.1. Variable adjustment.

Performance proxies in the existing literature can broadly be categorized as measures with and without risk adjustment. Raw returns are the performance measure without considering risk, while Jensen’s alpha, the Sharpe ratio, and the Treynor ratio are risk-adjusted measures. If raw returns are used even though the portfolios of SR and conventional firms have different risk profiles, there can be a spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional investment because they do not reflect proper risk factors (Becchetti and Ciciretti, 2009). Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-1.

The AESs will be smaller when risk-adjusted performance measures are used.

When calculating portfolio returns, value-weighting is theoretically more appropriate than equal-weighting. Value-weighting schemes are also in accord with typical financial industry practice (Humphrey and Tan, 2014), and most feasible for institutional investors who constitute the largest proportion of the SRI market (Trinks and Scholtens, 2017). In some cases, results based on value-weighting are different from those based on equal-weighting. For example, Statman and Glushkov (2009) find that excess returns of value-weighted portfolios are lower than those of equally weighted portfolios. If SRI mutual funds have a higher exposure to small firms than conventional funds (Luther and Matatko, 1994; Schröder, 2003), equal-weighting schemes can generate undeserved performance differences between SRI and conventional portfolios. In order to examine this effect, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-2.

The AESs calculated using a value-weighting scheme will be smaller than those using an equal-weighting scheme.

When calculating returns, some papers pay more attention to data accuracy by taking dividends and stock splits into account (Shank et al., 2005), whereas other papers ignore them. Inaccurate data can cause a spurious difference between SRI and conventional portfolios. For example, if SRI funds in general invest more in small firms than conventional funds (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994), ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in the performance.

of SRI and conventional portfolios. This is because, other things being equal, the SRI universe would have a lower dividend payout ratio than the conventional funds universe due to the higher investment opportunities of small firms over large firms. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-3.

The ESs will be smaller when returns are calculated reflecting stock splits and dividends.

# 2.3.2. Refining benchmark model.

Several authors examine the impact of SRI in the US market using a single-index framework (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005). However, the single-index model can produce distorted results by not controlling factors other than market portfolio. Prior literature indicates that SRI and conventional funds are different in their investment universe and portfolio strategies, having significantly different loadings on size, book-to-market, and momentum factors (Bauer et al., 2005; Renneboog et al., 2008b). In order to take into account the difference between the two types of funds, researchers use multi-factor models (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997; Galema et al., 2008; Edmans, 2011). A spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds may disappear if all relevant factors are incorporated.

CAPM, the Fama-French model, and the four-factor Carhart model are unconditional models since coefficients of factors do not change over time. In practice, however, fund managers change their portfolio holdings according to changes in macroeconomic environments, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles (Renneboog et al., 2008a). In this situation, the unconditional model may be inappropriate, hence Ferson and Schadt (1996) and Christopherson et al. (1998) propose conditional models that allow coefficients of factors to vary over time. Since investors on SRI funds may not be as sensitive as investors on conventional funds to economic environment changes, SRI funds may not adjust their portfolio holdings as quickly as conventional funds (Bollen, 2007; Benson and Humphrey, 2008). If this behavioral difference is ignored in deriving performance measures by employing the unconditional model as a benchmark, SRI performance would become spuriously different from conventional performance. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 10.

The AESs calculated using more refined return-generating models will be smaller.

# 2.3.3. Matching.

Some authors employ a matching procedure where each SRI fund is mapped with conventional funds of similar characteristics like size, location, composition, and time horizon so as to control confounding factors (Derwall and Koedijk, 2009; Ferruz et al., 2012; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). If proper counterfactuals to SRI portfolios are employed, the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance can be eliminated. Therefore, the AESs will be smaller when matching procedure is employed.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

The above discussion on methodological issues leads to the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 11.

The AESs will be smaller when more sophisticated methodologies are employed.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Meta-analysis

Since positive, negative, and no effect views can all be justified theoretically, synthesizing empirical findings to obtain the true overall impact of SRI is very important to both academia and industry. A meta-analysis is a particularly useful tool for this purpose, since it reflects the magnitude of performance differences between SRI and conventional groups by calculating ESs of individual studies and reporting overall ES utilizing information on the precision of individual studies (Combs et al., 2011).

Specifically, the first step of meta-analysis is to calculate the ES for each experiment or paper using Hedges’ g as follows (Hedges, 1981):

g = PT / r  (1)

where PT (PC) is the mean performance of portfolios included in the SRI (conventional) group and r is the pooled within-group standard deviation which can be computed using the following formula:

r = √((NT - 1)VT + (NC - 1)VC) / (NT + NC - 2)  (2)

where NT (NC) is the sample size of the SRI (conventional) group and VT (VC) is the variance of the SRI (conventional) group. Intuitively, the ES can be interpreted as a standardized performance difference between the two groups whatever the performance measures are and Table 1 shows the interpretation of ESs. The value of d = 0.01 has a very small effect, while d = 2.0 has a huge effect. Although we can typically compute ESs using the above equations, there are other cases where ESs are computed using different equations. The Appendix provides a detailed explanation on how to achieve ESs in special cases.

Once we obtain the ESs of each experiment or paper, the next step is to compute the weighted ES by considering all papers in the sample so as to obtain the overall SRI impact on portfolio performance as proposed by Hasselblad and Hedges.

There are in general multiple analyses in one paper. We use the terms “analysis,” “study,” “experiment” and “comparison” interchangeably.

# Table 1 Interpretation of effect size

This table contains interpretations for magnitudes of effect size and their references. Originally Cohen (1988) suggested three groups of ESs, small, medium, and large, and the other three ESs have been appended by Sawilowsky (2009). A similar interpretation can be made in cases of negative effect sizes.

|Effect size|d|References|
|---|---|---|
|Very small|0.01|Sawilowsky (2009)|
|Small|0.20|Cohen (1988)|
|Medium|0.50|Cohen (1988)|
|Large|0.80|Cohen (1988)|
|Very large|1.20|Sawilowsky (2009)|
|Huge|2.00|Sawilowsky (2009)|

(1995). The basic idea of weighting is to give higher weights to studies with more precise ES estimates, and the reciprocal of variance for each comparison is used as weights. When aggregating ESs, we use either a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model, depending on the assumption for variability. Details are in the Appendix. In addition, we delve into the possibility that SRI impacts on financial performance may vary systematically according to moderators and thus perform meta-regression analysis (Lipsey, 2001).

# 3.2. Variable Definitions

Table 2 summarizes all moderators and variables including dependent variables, either ESs or AESs. We split moderators into two broad categories, one for sampling and the other for methodology.

# 3.2.1. Sampling.

In order to investigate sampling issues, we establish moderators for time, publication status, researcher background, control groups, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds. Each moderator can have more than one variable to test a hypothesis, and variable definitions are shown in Table 2. For example, three variables are used to test publication status. Since publication bias is about statistical significance, we use two variables, Publication and Significance. In addition, we use a Quality variable to examine whether there is a systematic difference in AES according to journal quality. To examine the influence of control groups on ESs and AESs, we use two variables. SRP_CI is used to test Hypotheses 5-1 and 5-3 and SRI_CI is used to test Hypothesis 5-2.

# 3.2.2. Methodology.

As for methodology, we investigate issues related to variable adjustment (risk adjustment, portfolio weighting scheme, data accuracy), adding independent variables (multi-factor model, conditional model) and a matching procedure. To see the impact of the matching procedure, we also use two variables, Matching and Match_N. If

multiple firms are matched to an SRI sample, potential errors caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in the case of a one-to-one match can be minimized. This will in turn reduce the spurious difference between SRI and control portfolios.

# 4. Data

Since representativeness is crucial in meta-analysis, we try to collect as many papers as possible including unpublished ones to avoid publication bias. We search databases such as EBSCO, JSTOR, Science Direct, Springer Link, Wiley-Blackwell, and SSRN, and utilize web search engines like Google Scholar. We also attempt to collect papers from many academic journals, as shown in Table A2 of the Appendix.

A detailed description of our data collection process is shown in Table A1 and a flowchart in the Appendix. We first compose keywords that are related to SRI as extensively as possible. By using the phrase “socially responsible investment,” we obtain 1,555 articles that include at least one word in the phrase. Then, we check all articles one by one to sort out those that have the potential to be included in our final list of papers. By using the next phrase, “socially responsible investing,” we have 1,226 results. Since the two phrases are quite similar, most observations are duplicates of the first search and we obtain only two additional articles that have the potential to be included in the final sample. The process continues with new phrases until we use “ethical investing,” as shown in Table A1 of the Appendix. Since too many duplicates appear by that time, we begin to use the exact phrase “social investing” to narrow down the search results. We download 151 papers from this keyword search. Another important data collection process is to scrutinize the reference section of selected papers, especially summary or synthesis papers (Renneboog et al., 2008b; Chegut et al., 2011; Capelle-Blancard and Monjon, 2014).

After potential papers are collected, we read them more carefully to decide which papers are to be included in the final sample. Since the quality of data is crucial for an accurate assessment of SRI effects, we pay very careful attention to the data compilation process. The following explains some of the steps we have taken to preserve data integrity. Further details are in the Appendix.

1. We drop qualitative analyses.
2. If there are several versions of the same paper, we use the most recent paper to avoid overrepresentation bias. For example, Derwall et al. (2004) is a working paper version of Derwall et al. (2005), and we use the latter.
3. We include studies with matching firms or studies without matching firms but with market indices as benchmarks of SRI performance.
4. We include all relevant analyses based on important dimensions such as investment universe, sub-periods, conditional versus unconditional regression, matching versus non-matching, value weighted versus equal weighted, risk-adjusted versus risk-unadjusted, one-factor model versus multi-factor model, etc.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

After this screening process, we obtain 51 papers, 18 from the keyword search and 33 from reference checking, which study the impact of SRI on financial performance in the US. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) assert that the influence of SRI varies significantly with a difference in cultural background. Focusing on the US market helps us sharpen the interpretation of results without the need to consider cultural differences. Figure S1 shows the flowchart of the selection process. The publication dates of the final sample run from 1978 to 2016.

From the selected papers, we extract 205 experiments to calculate ESs. In other words, our number of observations is the number of experiments, not papers, since each paper reports multiple analyses. For example, if a paper reports two tables of comparison between SRI and conventional funds, with one based on raw return and the other based on Jensen’s alpha, we end up having two observations. Since a paper often reports results based on various subsamples, different experiments of the same paper can have different values for the number of firms, sample period, and all other relevant variables. We report detailed information including ESs on all 205 experiments in Table A2 of the Appendix.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Results on Effect Sizes

Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of ESs calculated from 205 comparisons. The median and mean ESs are 0.015 and 0.016 that can be interpreted as having very small ES according to Table 1. This result is consistent with many existing papers (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Humphrey et al., 2016). They find no significant difference in the performance of SRI and conventional funds in the US market, even though they examine different samples and time periods. The distribution of ESs is not normal since skewness and kurtosis are significantly different from normal distribution.

The first result of interest in our meta-analysis is the overall value of ESs that allows us to judge the impact of SRI on investment performance. In order to calculate the weighted ES, we use the reciprocal of variance of each comparison. Table 4 shows weighted ESs from running fixed and random-effect models. The weighted ES from the fixed-effect model is 0.068 and is statistically very significant. Although this result clearly indicates that the influence of SRI is negative to portfolio performance, it can be interpreted as having a very small effect economically.

This table shows weighted ESs and its 95% confidence interval from fixed- and random-effect models. It also reports test statistics for the appropriateness of using the random-effect model, Cochran’s Q or I2 statistic. *** represents statistical significance levels at the 1% levels, respectively.

|0.031|0.054|

Heterogeneity chi-squared = 4058.62*** (d.f. = 204) p = 0.000

I2 (variation in ES attributable to heterogeneity) = 95.0%

Test of ES = 0 : z = 18.16 p = 0.000

Test of ES = 0 : z = 0.51 p = 0.607

According to Table 1. Besides, the test statistic to judge between the fixed- and random-effect models, Cochran’s Q, strongly suggests that the random-effect model should be used in order to control heterogeneity among different studies. The value of I2 indicates that 95% of total variance is caused by between-study heterogeneity.

For the random-effect model, the variance used to calculate weight is the sum of within-study variance and between-study variance. In Table 4, the between-study variance is reported as s2, 0.0764, which is quite large. Unlike the result of the fixed-effect model, the weighted ES from the random-effect model is positive in sign, but the size is negligible and lacks statistical significance. This result largely supports Hypothesis 1 and is consistent with the evidence in many empirical papers on SRI (Sauer, 1997; Bello, 2005; Kreander et al., 2005; Bauer et al., 2007; Gregory and Whittaker, 2007).

Although the overall ES is not significantly different from zero, ESs can be systematically different depending on the moderators. We first report the results for moderators associated with sampling issues and proceed to present the results for moderators related to methodological issues. Predictions for moderators and empirical results are summarized in Table 2.

# 5.2.    Results on Sampling Issues

Table 5 shows AESs and ESs in each decade from the 1970s. ESs are very positive in the beginning. The SRI movement has been initiated by social activists and religious groups who emphasize various merits of SRI. However, the initial positive atmosphere has weakened as more firms engage in CSR activities and SRI performance undergoes more rigorous scrutiny by many researchers and investors, leading to a smaller SRI impact over time. In addition, the impact of SRI tends to decrease.

This table reports descriptive statistics for the changes in the absolute value of ESs and ESs themselves through decades. The first column indicates each decade from the 1970s. There is no result for the 1980s because our sample does not have any paper published in the 1980s.

with alternating signs, and both AESs and standard deviation tend to decrease over time. This result supports Hypothesis 2-1 in that researchers find a smaller impact for SRI over time and the disagreement among them has become smaller, too. The trend of finding a positive impact of SRI is followed by an average negative impact of SRI in the next decade, which is again followed by no significant influence of SRI as expected by dialectical movements of theory development.

The meta-regression results in Tables 6 and 7 further reinforce this interpretation on research trends in SRI area. The negative coefficients for the publication year variable suggest that researchers have come to obtain smaller AESs over time.

Another interesting result regarding the time dimension is shown in Table 8. During an economic crisis, investment performance is lower than it is in a normal period. SRI is not an exception in this regard. The negative coefficients of the Crisis variable indicate that papers whose sample periods include an economic crisis tend to have smaller ESs, which is consistent with Hypothesis 2-2.

# 5.2.2. Publication status.

We run a random-effect meta-regression with AES as the dependent variable and dummies for publication status and statistical significance as independent variables to (Table 7), where tau23. indicates the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimate test Hypothesis Univariate (Multivariate) results are shown in Table 6 of between-study variance and I2res is a percentage of residual variation due to heterogeneity. Since more than 85% of residual variance is caused by heterogeneity, running a random-effect meta-regression is well justified.

Contrary to the prediction of Hypothesis 3, the sign for the publication dummy is negative and statistically significant. When combined with the statistical significance dummy, the cross-multiplication term has a negative sign, as shown in model (5) of Table 7. It suggests that among statistically significant comparisons,

Published papers have a smaller impact on AESs. This is again inconsistent with the argument of publication bias.

In addition, we perform a test for publication bias using the Egger test of Stata 14.0 and report the result in Table 9. Since the intercept is not significantly different from zero, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no publication bias. Therefore, we can conclude that publication bias is not a serious concern for our paper.

The negative coefficient for the publication variable may indicate the quality of papers. Since authors have to go through a rigorous reviewing process to publish their papers in good journals, overly affirmative or overly negative results will be toned down. Thus, if the reviewing process is more rigorous, the AES will become smaller. To examine this idea, we introduce a new variable, Quality, which captures the quality of papers. It is equal to one for journals above median ranking in the same discipline classified by Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, and zero for journals below median ranking. As can be seen in Tables 6 and 7, the coefficients of the Quality variable are negative, indicating that papers published in better quality journals tend to have smaller AESs.

# 5.2.3. Author type.

Academic researchers and industry professionals are different in many respects, including incentives for research (Vaihekoski, 2004). In academic circles, the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted, but industry professionals are more concerned with finding superior abnormal return opportunities than providing evidence that supports the efficient market hypothesis. This difference will have a dampening effect on AESs for academic researchers. Consistent with this argument, Tables 6 and 7 show that academic researchers tend to find significantly smaller AESs than industry professionals, supporting Hypothesis 4-1. When combined with the statistical significance dummy in model (7) of Table 7, the cross-multiplication term of the two variables shows a significantly negative sign. It implies that among significant results, researchers in academia tend to find lower AESs than industry professionals, which is again consistent with Hypothesis 4-1.

It is possible that researchers in different disciplines may place a different priority on social and economic values. Researchers in the finance area may put a higher priority on profit maximization than social aspects, producing results showing a.

# 5.2.4. Control group.

In general, SRI funds characteristics are not the same as those of the market index, which includes not only SRI funds stocks but also stocks of all other conventional funds. In addition, since SRI cannot have unconstrained access to whole investment opportunities, SRI portfolios are different from well-diversified market portfolios. Owing to this difference, Hypothesis 5-1 predicts that papers comparing SRI portfolios with the market index will produce larger AESs than papers comparing SRI and conventional portfolios composed by author(s) according to their research objectives. Consistent with this hypothesis, the dummy variable for market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly positive sign in Tables 6 and 7. This argument is further reinforced by the negative sign of the SRI_CI variable, which is consistent with Hypothesis 5-2. Since the difference is lower when comparing two indexes than when comparing SRI portfolios with the index, the former tends to have smaller AESs.

On the other hand, Table 8 shows meta-regression results on the influence of sampling moderators upon ESs themselves. Consistent with Hypothesis 5-3, the dummy variable for using the market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly negative sign. It implies that the relative loss of diversification is larger when SRI portfolios are compared with the market index rather than other control portfolios. The negative sign is also consistent with Luther and Matatko (1994) who obtain mostly negative excess returns of SRI portfolios when they use the market index as benchmark.

# 5.2.5. Investment universe.

In Table 8, the dummy variable for the domestic market shows a positively significant coefficient, which is consistent with Hypothesis 6. Since the cultural aspect is an important determinant of ESs, the effect of SRI will be stronger when the investment universe is domestic rather than international. Markets with a homogeneous cultural background will be affected more strongly by SRI, since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006).

# 5.2.6. Screening procedure.

Table 8 shows that SRI funds using a positive screening procedure outperform funds with a negative screening, as postulated by Hypothesis 7. This result is consistent with Humphrey and Lee (2011) who find that a positive screening significantly reduces funds’ risk, but a negative screening increases risk since it impairs the ability of funds to form diversified portfolios. More directly, Goldreyer and Diltz (1999) and Statman and Glushkov (2009) show that a positive screening has a

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Positive impact on portfolio performance, but a negative screening has a negative impact.

# 5.2.7. Mutual funds.

Performance of mutual funds is subject to various factors such as transaction costs, fees and expenditures, and managerial compensation that are largely ignored in analyses on portfolios composed by researchers. In addition, it is well known that managed mutual funds do not perform better than the market as a whole (Jensen, 1968; Carhart, 1997). Therefore, ESs on SRI mutual funds will be smaller than ESs on SRI portfolios formed by researchers. A significantly negative sign for the coefficient of mutual fund moderator in Table 8 is supportive of these arguments and is consistent with Hypothesis 8.

# 5.3. Results on Methodological Issues

In this section, we report the impact that empirical methodologies used by author(s) may have on the AES. Table 10 (Table 11) contains the results of univariate (multivariate) regressions.

# 5.3.1. Variable adjustments.

To begin with, the coefficient of the risk adjustment dummy is statistically significant with a negative sign. This is consistent with Hypothesis 9-1, indicating that the AESs calculated from risk-adjusted performance measures are systematically smaller than those calculated from raw returns. Table 12 reports the risk-adjusted performance measures used in the sample. The majority of papers use Jensen’s alpha, and only a small number of papers use the Sharpe ratio or the Treynor index (M’Zali and Turcotte, 1998). Other measures are mostly based on accounting data such as return on assets and the average ES is very large (Cohen et al., 1997). Basically, stock returns are forward looking, but accounting data are not, and it is not uncommon to have conflicting results in finance research. Moreover, the small sample size of other measures makes it difficult to draw any serious inference.

Since SRI funds have a different exposure from conventional funds to small firms, equally weighted portfolio returns can generate undeserved performance differences between the two, unlike value-weighted returns. In Tables 10 and 11, the coefficient of weighting scheme has a negative sign and is statistically significant, indicating that the value weighting scheme tends to have smaller AESs, as predicted by Hypothesis 9-2.

Hypothesis 9-3 suggests that using more accurate data can reduce the possibility of obtaining a spurious difference between SRI and conventional investments. For example, if SRI funds invest more in small firms than conventional funds, ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in SRI and conventional portfolio performance. Therefore, papers improving data accuracy by considering dividends and stock splits when calculating returns will have smaller AESs. The significantly negative sign of data accuracy variable in model (2) of Table 11 is consistent with Hypothesis 9-3 although other regressions do not show statistical significance.

# 5.3.2. Refining benchmark model.

Some authors use a single-index model as a return-generating process to compute excess returns (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005), while others use multi-factor models (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994; Gregory et al., 1997). The negative sign on the Index variable in Tables 10 and 11 suggests that the AESs calculated using multi-factor models are smaller than those calculated using a single-index model, consistent with Hypothesis 10. Since multi-index models control for more dimensions of corporate characteristics than single-index models, a spurious difference in performances between SRI and conventional portfolios tends to be smaller than in the case of using a single-index model.

In practice, fund managers change their portfolio holdings if macroeconomic conditions change, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles. In this case, conditional models are more appropriate for handling dynamic return-generating.

# 5.3.3. Matching.

Matching procedures will eliminate the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance caused by confounding factors and induce AESs to be smaller. Consistent with this argument postulated in Hypothesis 11, Tables 10 and 11 show that the coefficient of matching dummy has a significantly negative sign. In addition, the negative sign of the Match_N variable suggests that possible bias caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in one-to-one matching can be minimized by matching multiple counterparts, leading to a reduction in unwarranted differences between SRI and conventional portfolios.

# 6. Conclusions and Discussions

This article investigated the impact of SRI on investment performance in the US, using a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis makes a comparison across diverse studies possible by computing ES that is a standardized measure of impact derived from treatment and control groups.

The empirical results show that the weighted average ES is not different from zero. It is an important finding for investors since they do not have to be concerned with the possibility of sacrificing returns when they pursue investment strategies that are socially responsible.

We establish various moderators and run meta-regressions in order to examine whether ESs and AESs change systematically depending on research characteristics. For this, we split moderators into two groups, one related to sampling issues and the other related to methodological issues. To begin with, we find that ESs are positive in the earlier period and have become smaller in terms of absolute value with alternating signs as time passes. When the idea of SRI was relatively new, investors seemed to be able to earn excess returns by incorporating SRI elements in their portfolio. However, the excess return opportunity may have decreased over time and researchers seem to find a smaller impact of SRI since spurious differences between SRI and conventional investment performances are eliminated by the improvement in sampling and methodology and this pattern is by and large consistent with a dialectical development of theories. We also find that papers with sample periods containing economic crisis tend to show a lower ES, as expected.

As for publication status, we find no evidence of publication bias, so we can interpret our results without this complication caused by the publication status of papers. An interesting finding is that better quality journals show relatively smaller AESs than lower quality journals, suggesting that rigorous review processes make papers tone down unwarranted excessive claims.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Whereas the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted in academia, researchers from industry are more interested in developing a logical backup for industry practices such as active portfolio management and finding the profit potential in SRI. Owing to this difference in research incentives and environment, academic researchers tend to uncover smaller AESs than industry professionals. However, there is no systematic difference in SRI performance among scholars in different disciplines.

Obviously, the chance of having spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds becomes higher as the two groups are more different. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the AESs are bigger when SRI samples are compared with market indexes than when SRI samples are compared with conventional portfolios. And, the AESs are smaller when SRI indexes, not SRI portfolios, are compared with conventional indexes.

Studies comparing SRI portfolios with market portfolios rather than other conventional portfolios tend to show lower ESs. In addition, studies examining negative screening tend to generate smaller ESs than those with positive screening. SRI portfolios and negative screening portfolios seem to sacrifice a diversification benefit, compared with market portfolio and positive screening portfolios, respectively.

Cultural background seems to be an important factor, since domestic SRI funds tend to show higher ESs than international funds. Finally, studies of mutual fund samples show smaller ESs than those of author-composed portfolios. This is largely consistent with capital market efficiency and evidence on mutual fund performances that managed funds rarely beat the market. This result is also related to the fact that mutual fund performance incorporates all costs such as fees, transaction costs, and management compensation, whereas a comparison of composed portfolios in general does not fully take this aspect into account.

We investigate three methodological issues: variable adjustment, the refining benchmark model, and matching procedure. Regarding variable adjustment, our results indicate that any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios can be reduced by using risk-adjusted performance measures, value-weighting schemes, and more accurate variables. Refining benchmark models is related to the issue of return-generating models. Papers using multi-factor models seem to report a lower SRI impact than those using a single-index model. As for matching procedure, papers employing a matching strategy between SRI and control portfolios tend to show smaller AESs. These results suggest that researchers must try to secure similarities as much as possible to minimize a spurious performance difference between SRI and control portfolios. Researchers also have to avoid making various methodological errors.

There is a limitation to drawing a universal conclusion on the impact of SRI upon investment performance, since our empirical result is based only on the US market. However, the findings in this article can be a valid starting point for future research. A natural candidate for future research is an inter-country or inter-

regional comparison of SRI performances. Although data collection and reﬁnement and the interpretation of results based on different cultural backgrounds would be quite challenging, such a study will deﬁnitely enhance our understanding of this important issue.

As for methodology, it is true that meta-analysis is a good tool to summarize many papers on the same subject. However, a wide variety of differences among selected papers in terms of sampling and methodology is a signiﬁcant challenge when performing a sound meta-analysis. Theoretically, the SRI performance can be different depending on the research period, crisis versus normal times, security types, portfolio diversiﬁcation, social and cultural backgrounds, domestic versus international investments, and so forth. However, even though there would be only one true level of performance difference between SRI and control portfolios caused by a particular factor, researchers may ﬁnd a dissimilar performance difference if they use different research methodologies. Therefore, future research should be able to separate out more clearly a true SRI impact and the variation in observed SRI performance caused by differences in the research methodologies employed.
