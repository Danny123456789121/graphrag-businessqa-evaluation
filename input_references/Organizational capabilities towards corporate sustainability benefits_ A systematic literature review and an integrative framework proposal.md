# Organizational capabilities for sustainability towards corporate sustainability benefits: a systematic literature review and an integrative framework proposal

# ABSTRACT

This research relates the theme of corporate sustainability to organizational capabilities from business strategy. The literature brings initial indications on the contribution of strategic organizational capabilities to corporate sustainability. However, these attempts are still incipient and non-structured. Thus, in order to explore different organizational capabilities that companies can develop to obtain sustainability benefits, this paper aims to propose an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits. For this, a systematic literature review was conducted, based on a paper sample of 88 publications extracted from the ISI Web of Science database. The paper also develops a descriptive overview of the subject, presenting the main gaps and a research agenda. The results showed that corporate sustainability is strongly related to business strategy and the ability of companies to develop specific capabilities. Thus, the understanding from academics and managers on what strategic organizational capabilities (OCs) consists and how they can be developed or improved is fundamental to reaching corporate sustainability. The paper presents some contributions. First, the integrative framework developed from the literature review comprises seven categories of organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCSs) related to ten categories of corporate sustainability benefits (CSBs). Second, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization to achieve a certainly expected sustainability benefit. Third, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature and those that need further research. Fourth, the overview of the literature of OCS by bibliometric and cluster analyses allowed a broad understanding of how academics have addressed these themes over the years. Finally, the research agenda developed from the literature review may broaden opportunities for further research on the subject.

Organizational Capabilities, Corporate Sustainability, Corporate Sustainability Benefits.

# 1. Introduction

The literature has indicated that organizations that take into account the impacts of their actions on the environment and society may achieve economic returns, competitive advantage and better performance (Dangelico et al., 2017; Hofmann et al., 2012; Barnett and Salomon, 2012; Reuter et al., 2010; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

In this scenario, the logic of corporate sustainability has been gaining prominence among companies and researchers have been studying corporate sustainability from a strategic perspective, considering that organization capabilities (OCs) developed by

companies can influence it (Amui et al., 2017; Annunziata et al. 2017; Branco and Rodrigues, 2006). OC can be defined as the ability of an organization to perform tasks to achieve desired results by using its available resource base (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003; Winter, 2003; Zollo and Winter, 2002).

The first relevant studies on resources and capabilities from a strategic management perspective are found from the Resource Based View (RBV) (Barney, 2001; Wernerfelt, 1984). The RBV focuses on resources and capabilities to explain the superior performance of some companies to reach a competitive advantage. A relevant contribution of this field is related to the dynamic capabilities approach (DC), presented by Teece et al. (1997) to explain competitive advantage in dynamic markets.

However, the RBV was considered limited since it does not incorporate the external environment. The incorporation of environmental issues into this body of knowledge was pioneered by Hart (1995), who proposed the Natural Resource-Based View of the Firm (NRBV) as a more complete framework when considering the natural resources and environmental problems into RBV. According to Hart (1995), the challenges posed by the natural environment are among the most important factors in the new pattern of resource development and OCs. Hart and Dowell (2011) analyzed that the economic and social environmental challenges raised in the NRBV have multiplied over the years.

In this sense, Annunziata et al. (2017) argue that sustainability-oriented companies should identify and develop specific capabilities rooted in the organization to implement practices that are a source of competitiveness in an increasingly aware and attentive market for sustainability issues. The literature presents several studies that address the OCs related to obtaining strategic benefits for corporate sustainability. For instance, it mentions the use of proactive environmental strategies (Delmas et al., 2011; Fraj Andrés et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2007; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998), successful implementation of environmental management practices and systems (Charan and Murty, 2018; Yu and Ramanathan, 2016; Johnson, 2017), support of corporate social responsibility (Choi et al., 2019; Ramachandran, 2011; Renouard, 2011; Torugsa et al., 2012), and support to the management of the green supply chain (Bowen et al., 2001; Choi and Hwang, 2015; Paulraj, 2011; Peters et al., 2011). In this context, attention to organizational capabilities related to sustainability is essential.

However, although there is a body of knowledge on OCS, there is a recent need for more research in this area. According to Gelhard and Delft (2016), the literature has

# Journal Pre-proof

been debating about performance in facing economic, social and environmental issues. Nevertheless, the relationship between OC and sustainability benefits remains little explored. For example, Gabler, Richey and Rapp (2015) argue that little is known about how firms determine and use the appropriate resources to maximize the performance of environmental initiatives. Yu and Ramanathan (2016) comment on the need to empirically explore the development of an environmental management capability. Hofmann et al. (2012) also stated that little is known about how strategic firm-specific capabilities may facilitate the adoption of sustainability initiatives. In particular, the present research addresses Amui et al. (2017) indication towards the opportunity for studies seeking to identify the types of dynamic capabilities that can be developed in order to more effectively overcome the emerging challenges of sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also recommended how important is further research to expand organization capabilities, especially those responsible for environmental issues.

Thus, since OCS can bring strategic sustainability benefits for companies, and focusing on addressing these research gaps, this study seeks to answer the following research questions: (i) What are the main types of strategic OCS addressed in the literature? (ii) May the OCSs lead to the development of corporate sustainability benefits (CSB), and what would these benefits be? (iii) How strategic OCS and CSB can be linked together to provide an integrative framework? Therefore, this paper performs a systematic literature review (SLR) by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, we proposed an integrative framework linking strategic OCS and CSB.

This paper contributes to the academic literature in some ways. First, it advances the knowledge of OCS, since it identifies and maps several strategic sustainability benefits that can be achieved by organizations through the development of OCs. Second, although recently Amui et al. (2017) have conducted a SLR on capabilities for sustainability in order to systematize the available knowledge, identifying the current lack of research on the integration of these themes, the authors did not focus on types of OCSs, nor the relation of OCs with the benefits of corporate sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also conducted an SLR on organizational capabilities and sustainability, but their focus was on eco-innovation. Thus, this evidence demonstrates the advancement and contribution of this paper concerning the previous literature. Third, the findings may assist firms in improving their strategic OC, especially those responsible for CSB, enhancing sustainability performance consistent with the environmental and social.

changes. Finally, the paper allows a better understanding of obtaining different benefits of corporate sustainability through specific capabilities of the company, regarding the business strategy point of view.

This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, section 2 presents the research methodology. Section 3 presents a general overview on OCS literature. Section 4 presents the integrative framework that relates to OCS with CSB. Section 5 discusses the literature gaps and presents a research agenda. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusions, implications, limitations and directions for further research.

# 2. Method

The SLR can be defined as a tool to identify, evaluate and interpret available and relevant studies regarding a particular research question (Kitchenham, 2004). The SLR steps adopted in this research are adapted from Tranfield et al. (2003): review planning, conducting the review, and reporting and dissemination (Fig. 1).

This Figure also describes the main objectives, methods, and tools adopted, as well as where the results were presented in the paper.

# Step 1 - Review Planning

Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that it is necessary to carry out studies to evaluate the relevance of the subject to be researched, as well as to delimit the area of study. In this step, we sought to analyze in a preliminary and exploratory way forms by which OCS research topics are being approached by the literature. We searched Google Scholar for papers that studied OC related to sustainability. We noticed that a great number of authors studies these themes, although recently. In this step, we also analyze the main terms adopted by the articles to define the search terms (strings). In this way, an adherent search could be conducted to cover papers that approach the subject.

# Step 2 - Conducting the Review

This step comprises stages for defining the portfolio. Tranfield et al. (2003) state that the search strategy should be reported in sufficient detail to ensure that it can be replicated. A search systematization begins with the identification of search strings drawn from the scope of the study and discussions with the group involved with the review (Tranfield et al., 2003).

Thus, using the ISI Web of Knowledge (WOS) database in February/2019, two searches were carried out contemplating the theme of organizational capabilities (and related terms) and sustainability (and related terms) (Fig. 2). The WOS can be considered one of the most prestigious academic literature databases in the world (Wang and Waltman, 2015).

The first search, named "search 1", had as search strings terms related to capabilities and sustainability (and its synonyms) in order to not lose relevant content. The search was conducted by the “title” on WOS. “Search 1” was complemented by "search 2", which added other search terms considered relevant for the sustainability approach, such as “social performance” and “social responsibility”. We also performed this search by “title” on WOS. However, a low number of results were obtained. Therefore, we performed another search but replacing the search for "title" with "topic" in the terms related to sustainability. Fig. 2 summarizes these searches.

Then, we began the selection of studies. For that, some analyses were performed as recommended by Ensslin et al. (2017) and Tranfield et al. (2003), aiming at alignment.

# Journal Pre-proof

Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that only studies meeting the specified inclusion criteria should be part of the sample. The authors underscore the importance of documenting the numbers of included and excluded studies at each step of the review, providing reasons for the exclusions. At this stage, the software EndNote was used to eliminate duplicates, and read titles and summaries of articles. After completing all the steps, the final sample consisted of 88 papers, which are presented in Appendix 1.

For the data extraction stage, Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that researchers should consider the information that will be required to design summary tables and to perform data synthesis. Forms may include details on the source of information (title, authors, journals, and publication details) and any other features that could be relevant to the study. In this research, a spreadsheet was created in MS Excel, fed with information such as title, authors, year, journal, number of citations, objectives, theories, methods, gaps, research opportunities and types of OCs. It was important for assisting the analysis of the studies.

Thus, articles were analyzed by content analysis, which is a highly flexible research method widely used as a systematic and rigorous approach to analyze data obtained or generated during the study (White and Marsh, 2006). According to the authors, content analysis may have qualitative and quantitative applications, or both, as is the case of this paper.

# Step 3 - Reporting and dissemination

An appropriate SLR should make it easier to understand the research by synthesizing works (Tranfield et al., 2003). Based on quantitative and descriptive analysis, we sought to obtain an overview of the articles. Thus, we analyzed the evolution in the number of articles over the years, research methods, sustainability pillars, geographical/sectoral arrangements, industrial sectors, countries where empirical studies were developed and journals with the highest number of publications. Finally, we performed a cluster analysis on the keywords of the sample articles using VosViewer software.

In the qualitative dimension, an inductive analysis was performed. It is recommended when there are no previous studies investigating the phenomenon or when knowledge is fragmented (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). Thus, this analysis was appropriate for this research since we identified no studies seeking to identify and synthesize types of OCS.

# Journal Pre-proof

Thus, we sought to identify the different OCs and their relationship to sustainability. There was an extensive number of OCSs in the articles. We also realized that, although authors used different terms, some of such capabilities shared the same definition or were strongly related (see Table 2. General overview of OCSs categories, in Section 4.1). Therefore, it was possible to group them into categories. According to Cavanagh (1997), the creation of categories aims to provide a means of describing the phenomenon, increasing understanding and generation of knowledge.

To formulate categories through analysis of inductive content, it is necessary that the researchers interpret and decide which information should be grouped in the same category (Dey, 1993). The objective is to reduce the number of categories by grouping similar ones, or group different categories into broader categories (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). In this paper, the OCs that comprise each category do not necessarily have the same meaning but are interrelated since their definitions complement each other.

As warned by Dey (1993), the development of such categories did not occur simply by gathering similar or related information. The OCSs were deeply analyzed as belonging or not to a given category by comparing them with other OCSs that belong or not to that category. Thus, it was possible to define where each OCS was best fitted and which category needed to be formed since no OCS could be placed in a category into which it did not fit. Thus, the OCS identified during the review process were grouped into categories since they have related concepts and definitions (regarding strategic capabilities for sustainability - see Table 2). The related terms adopted by the authors' sample are described in Column 3 of Table 2, allowing an understanding of the inclusion relationship with the category in which each OCS was found.

Since the OCS categories were identified, a similar procedure was performed to identify the expected sustainability benefits related to such capabilities. In this way, we verified that the studies related to OCS sought to investigate, in a general way, whether their development led companies to obtain benefits related to corporate sustainability.

The identification procedure was similar to that used for OCS, that is, some benefits were similar or related. Thus, such benefits have also been grouped into broader categories (Table 4). Each identified benefit was related to the article from which it was extracted. Finally, from these analyses, it was possible to develop an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, as well as provide an overview on research gaps and propose a research agenda on the topic.

# 3. General overview on the literature on organization capabilities for sustainability

Fig. 3 presents the evolution of publications over the years. The first paper related to OCS was published in 1998 (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). It is a relevant research since several other authors of this sample cited it (it was the most cited - 786 citations, according to the WOS). This may be an indication that some authors have started researching on this topic from the perspective of Sharma and Vredenburg (1998).

However, the studies are scarce in the following years, with an increase in 2008. The years 2015 to 2019 (the latter year encompasses only two months) indicate that studies on this topic has been intensified, demonstrating the relevance of this theme in the current context.

The articles were published in 45 different journals. Some of these journals have as their main scope topics related to environmental issues, while others have a more general and well-diversified scope, which indicates that different areas are linking their research to the OCS issues. The most significant journal in the sample is the Journal of Cleaner Production, with 16 articles. All journals that had more than two sample articles published have a relevant Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which demonstrates the importance of publications on the subject.

Fig. 4 shows that the research methods favor practical and theoretical approaches. The survey is the most used method, and represents the only type of quantitative approach of the sample. The use of this method has increased over the years (highlighting 2017 and 2018, with the largest number of publications). Regarding theoretical articles, there is a

significant number. This corroborates the fact that it is a subject of recent research and still demands exploitation of knowledge. Most theoretical articles deal with deepening of the study topics, relations between theories, among others. Among the articles with a theoretical approach, only Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019) conducted an SLR, and none aimed to develop an integrative framework that related strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, which confirms the importance of this study.

However, there are only 13 among 88 articles using a qualitative approach (Fig. 4). Among case studies, 3 of them have a longitudinal approach. It is not explicit whether there is a tendency in using this method over time. However, from 2008, the case study has been used over the following years, which demonstrates the validity of this method within this research theme. Finally, only two papers adopted mixed methods.

# Fig. 5 shows the sustainability pillars as discussed over the years.

The environmental pillar is the strongest, and was studied mainly in isolation. However, there are articles contemplating the environmental pillar together with other pillars (social or economic, or both). The social pillar, separated from the environmental pillar, was the least explored, and only the article of Ramachandran (2011) was found. It should be noted that the economic pillar, although not used as a search string (since it is not part of the scope of this paper), is still evidenced from 2008. This is justified because many papers

Dealing with some pillar of sustainability (environmental or social) usually relate this analysis to the economic question.

In relation to the sustainability pillar, we found that most studies dealing with the environmental pillar in conjunction with other pillars still have a major focus on the environmental pillar. In this sense, most capabilities studied are related to the environmental pillar, which is why the findings of this research are focused mainly on this pillar.

Shows business arrangement where the studies were conducted. Most articles studied the context of individual firms, often identifying the industry of which the companies were a part. A low number of studies did not identify this sector. A considerable part of the works analyzed OCSs from the point of view of supply chains and, to a small extent, in the context of multinationals. The study of OCSs in the context of industrial clusters was conducted by only one research. This can be explained by Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008), who argued that most studies have examined environmental capabilities internally, leaving aside the moderating role of business environment characteristics (e.g., spillover effects) and the cooperation between organizations through clustering for the implementation of sustainable initiatives.

Some studies focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which is interesting, since there are particularities in these companies such as reduced capital, centralization of functions, among others, that hinder the development of OCSs. Deepening studies focusing on this subject are still relevant since it is still scarce.

Table 1 shows the industrial sectors in which empirical research was developed. The manufacturing sector is the most representative, followed by chemical industries, construction industry and food industry/agri-food. Although there are more studies focusing on industrial sector, the service sector, specifically hotels and resorts, comes in third place. A wide variety of sectors aside those where environmental impacts are clearer (e.g., manufacturing, chemical industry, construction and industrial wastes) were also addressed (such as technology and services). This indicates that sustainability has been receiving attention by all business sectors.

Fig. 7 shows the geographical distribution of the countries where the empirical research was carried out, with a global interest in the subject. Countries with advanced economies, such as the US, followed by the UK and Germany, have a greater number of

studies. In addition, it can be observed that most researches were conducted in developed economies. Some have been conducted in developing economies such as China and Malaysia. China is the country with the largest CO2 emissions in the world. It is often the object of study in sustainability-related studies. This fact is evident in the sample since China appears in fifth place.

Finally, among the 88 articles, few studies developed an empirical study in more than one country. Sharma et al. (2007), Judge and Elenkov (2005), Luzzini et al. (2015), Sarpin et al. (2016), Behnam et al. (2018) and Betts et al. (2018) are some examples. Since cross-country research is more difficult to perform, studies focusing on this aspect are still rare.

Lastly, Fig. 8 shows the co-occurrence of keywords over time. There is a total of 36 words with a minimum occurrence of 5 times. It is observed that the most outstanding words are “competitive advantage”, “resource-based view” and “dynamic capabilities” and these have a greater incidence in the time interval from 2014 to 2016. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the most recent themes within this subject are “firm performance”, “eco-innovation”, “market orientation” and “collaboration”. In general, it can be analyzed that the keywords are very interrelated with each other and with the area of business strategy and corporate sustainability. For example, we identified terms with different approaches to (i) performance (financial performance, business performance, environmental performance), (ii) strategy (strategic management, environmental strategy), (iii)

competitive advantage and those related terms, and, (iv) sustainability (such as green, environmental management, corporate social performance, among others).

Finally, it is important to highlight that although these are not themes that are directly related to the themes of this research, we identified the incidence of terms related to innovation (eco-innovation, product innovation, product development) and terms related to supply chains, which is indicative that these themes are close to organizational capabilities and corporate sustainability.

# 4. Integrative framework relating strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits

The present Section provides a qualitative and deep analysis of the paper’s sample. Content analysis techniques were conducted from which OCSs were identified (Section 4.2), as well as their relations to corporate sustainability (Section 4.2).

# 4.1. Organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCS)

As described in section 2, the OCSs were grouped into categories. These categories allow synthesizing the literature that addresses this research topic, thus helping in the understanding and operationalization of the constructs. Seven OCSs categories were created: capabilities related to collaborative relationships for sustainability (OCS1), capabilities related to the absorption of knowledge/learning about sustainability (OCS2), capabilities related to innovation/technology for sustainability (OCS3), capabilities related to alignment/motivation for sustainability (OCS4), capabilities related to marketing/external communication for sustainability (OCS5), capabilities related to flexibility/adaptation on sustainable issues (OCS6), and capabilities related to the management of sustainable operations (OCS7).

Table 2 presents the OCS categories, followed by a general definition assigned to each one. Since the similar and related capabilities that compose each category received different nomenclatures, the column 3 of Table 2 presents the terms of capabilities that comprise each category. Finally, column 4 presents the respective references that applied those terms.

Table 3 presents the evolution over the years of studies that addressed each of these OCSs. The studies are presented as codes (described in Appendix 1).

# 4.2. Relations between organizational capabilities and expected corporate sustainability benefits

The OCS1 are those most frequent within the analyzed paper sample (29 publications in total); OCS6 and OCS7 were those with the lowest number of papers (10 and 11 in total, respectively). It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.

It can be seen that OCS1, OCS2 and OCS3 have a larger number of articles that have studied it and are also the pioneers, being first studied in 1998 by Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) and continued to gain relevance over the years. Already COS5 is the most recent, with studies from 2011.

Since we identified the OCS categories, we extracted from the papers the expected corporate sustainability benefits related to OCS. Similar to the OCSs, such benefits have also been grouped into categories in order to synthesize knowledge and facilitate the understanding and operationalization of these constructs.

The sustainability benefits related to OCS were grouped into ten categories according to the similarity of their approaches. They are presented in the first column of Table 4 (the studies are presented as codes - see Appendix 1): support for environmental strategy/strategic proactivity (CSB1), sustainable innovation support (CSB2), support for environmental management systems/tools/practices (CSB3), improving the absorption of knowledge on sustainable issues (CSB4), support for corporate social responsibility (CSB5), green supply chain support (CSB6), improving environmental collaboration (CSB7), improving environmental adaptability (CSB8), improving green marketing (CSB9), and improving firm performance (CSB10).

The second column of Table 4 describes in detail these CSB categories and indicates how the literature relates them to the seven categories of OCSs. It can be observed that a large number of studies have addressed OCSs related to CSB10, CSB2 and CSB6. A low number of papers related to CSB8 and CSB4.

# Journal Pre-proof

The achievement of these benefits is related to the development of different OCSs. The benefits linked to “improving firm performance” and “support for sustainable innovation” and “support the green supply chain”, for example, are linked to all the seven OCSs identified in this survey. Just as a single OCS can be tied to different benefits, such as OCS related to collaborative relationships for sustainability can bring companies nine of the ten sustainability benefits identified in the survey. This represents how important OCSs development is for companies to achieve a number of sustainability benefits.

By converging content analysis results from the seven OCS categories and the ten associated expected corporate sustainability benefits, an integrative conceptual framework emerged (Fig. 9). The framework summarizes the main findings of this research. The OCSs categories are presented along with the code of the articles that addressed them. CSBs categories are also presented along with OCS categories to which they are related, and along with the code of the article that addressed such relationships (codes are detailed in Appendix 1).

The colors demonstrate the presence of these categories in the analyzed papers. For example, the OCS categories and the CSB categories in green are the most studied by the sample's paper; the yellow has a moderate number of studies, while the red ones were categories with a greater scarcity of researches. Thus, based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature, as well as those that still need further investigation. Through the framework, it is also possible to identify articles referring to each category (OCSs and CSBs), and the relations between these categories as addressed in each of the articles, thus helping to disseminate knowledge about these topics and further the development of new research associated to these constructs.

# 5. Literature gaps and opportunities for future research

From the quantitative and qualitative analyses, it was possible to analyze the characteristics and tendencies of the articles that addressed OCSs. Thus, we identified the main gaps in the literature and, from them, we proposed opportunities for future researches in relation to method used, sustainability pillars, business arrangements, countries and relationships between OCS and CSB categories.

# Methods

Regarding the methods used (Fig. 4), qualitative approaches require more research, such as single and multiple case studies, longitudinal case studies (which appear in a small number in the sample). Salim et al. (2019) corroborate with our findings, although the authors suggested focusing on internal eco-innovation capabilities by developing action research. Longitudinal case studies are relevant since sustainable actions and results from the development of OCS can, in most cases, be better visualized and measured over time. Qualitative approaches, in spite of limitations in relation to the generalization of results, are able to make in-depth and detailed analyses of the phenomenon under study. Surveys are not able to accomplish this because they are descriptive. New research can also use mixed approaches, as also recommended by Amui et al. (2017).

The survey method was predominant (Fig. 4). Thus, future studies can use mathematical modeling, such as multicriteria tools to evaluate the maturity degree of

# Journal Pre-proof

companies in relation to OCSs and prioritize factors and sub-factors relevant to the development of OCSs, for example.

# Sustainability pillars

Upon analyzing the studies, there are opportunities for new studies relating OC to social issues, since this pillar has been studied separately from the environmental pillar only by Ramachandran (2011) (see Fig. 5). Further studies should deal with more than one pillar (environmental, social and economic), since most papers dealing with the environmental pillar along with other pillars, nevertheless, have a main focus on the environmental pillar.

# Business arrangement

Considering that OCSs were studied to a large extent in the context of individual firms (Fig. 6), the importance of developing researches in different productive arrangements is stressed, such as industrial clusters, since only Hilliard and Jacobson (2011) studied OCS using this focus. Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008) indicated that the findings on the effects external to firms on the achievement of competitive advantages based on environmental capabilities have important implications for future research in both environmental management strategy and the study of industrial agglomerations and geographic clusters. This is because clusters reveal that the business environment outside companies also plays a vital role in their performance (Porter, 1998). The cluster analysis (Fig. 8) has the same indication; that is, collaboration is a new subject, and the OCS could be studied in the context of networks.

Another alternative is related to the development of studies within the context of multinational companies, since only two studies had this focus: Chakrabarty and Wang (2012) and Pinkse et al. (2010). Such studies may produce interesting results because, depending on the location/country where the multinationals are located, comparative analyses can be done since aspects for the development of OCSs can be facilitated or made difficult by local characteristics such as culture, access to specialized labor, local development etc. OCSs can also be influenced by the location of companies. For example, in some regions, customers are more aware and more easily influenced to take sustainability issues into account in the consumption of goods and services, and pressures for environmental certifications, for example, are higher than in other regions. This can be captured and compared by studying multinationals.

# Journal Pre-proof

# Countries

Since most of the studies carried out empirical studies in countries with advanced economies, there is an opportunity for research in developing countries and in different countries. This research opportunity was also analyzed by Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019), who both had developed SLR with research themes related to this article. Therefore, it will be possible the development of comparative analyses on how aspects of the local context, such as economy and culture, influence the development of OCSs, as well as the expected CSB.

# OCSs and expected corporate sustainability benefits

As can be seen in Table 3, research on OCS and consequently on CSB has increased over the years and can be considered quite relevant in the current context. Studies focusing on OCS6 and OCS7 are still necessary, since they received less attention by the researchers in the sample. Regarding CSBs (Table 4), several OCSs are related to the same groups of expected benefits. However, some of them are unrelated, as can be seen in the Table 4, and therefore means future research opportunities.

Finally, from the research opportunities, it was possible to elaborate Fig. 10, which synthesizes the research agenda presented here. All relationships between OCSs and CBSs that have not yet been studied are identified by arrows between the first two columns. For all proposed relationships, there are opportunities for methods (column 3), geographical contexts (column 4) and, finally, countries (column 5).

# 6. Conclusions, contributions, limitations and future research

This research systematized the available knowledge on strategic OCS. Therefore, this paper performs an SLR by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, it was possible to identify CSB from the OCS and propose an integrative framework linking both.

# 6.1. Contributions for theory and practice

This paper presents relevant contributions. The main contribution is the proposed framework (Fig. 9) that relates to OCSs (Table 2, Table 3, and Fig. 9) and CSBs (Table 4). The framework is relevant as it identifies and categorizes OCSs and CSBs that companies can acquire by developing and improving those OC. OCSs and CSBs have been studied over the years by a large number of authors, but no survey so far has been proposed to map the studies through an analysis of all existing literature. Based on this, we develop a framework that synthesizes all the OC developed by the companies (internal).

and external) and the sustainability benefits tied to those capabilities. This is the great contribution of this article.

Based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature. The OCS1 is the most relevant in the analyzed sample of articles. The OCS6 and OCS7 were the ones with the lowest number of articles, providing indications that still need further investigation. It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.

In practice, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization in order to achieve a certain expected sustainability benefit. Besides, the framework provides an overview on core aspects that can serve as basis for a comprehensive sustainability performance measurement system, providing a structured decision-making background for practitioners. This is crucial since decisions regarding sustainable issues combine a series of factors such as social responsibility issues, risks, economic issues, personal preferences and others (Maroušek et al., 2014) and according to Maroušek (2013) decision-makers of the current generation, who have more contact with academic knowledge, are more concerned with sustainability.

The second contribution is related to the overview of the studies that addressed OCS. Overall, through the overview, it was possible to identify the evolution of the research on the subject (Fig. 3), the research methods (Fig. 4), and the sustainability pillars over the years (Fig. 5). We also identified the business arrangement (Fig. 6), the industrial sector (Table 1), as well as the countries where the empirical studies were carried out (Fig. 7). Finally, a cluster analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords over time (Fig. 8) was developed.

The third contribution of this research was the presentation of a research agenda developed from the overview of the articles and the proposed framework. We concluded that various OCS and CSB still need to be identified and better explored in the literature, as well as the companies. The research agenda is important because it aids researchers by presenting several options for new studies, which allow furthering the knowledge on these themes (Fig. 10). Briefly, the research agenda shows that more qualitative and mixed research is needed, with a primary focus on the social pillar, or the three pillars together (social, environmental and economic), in the context of different productive arrangements (such as industrial clusters), multinationals companies, and in developing and different.

# 6.2. Limitations and opportunities for future research

This paper has some limitations. For example, in relation to the search and selection of articles related to the OCS, only one database was adopted. We use exclusion criteria such as conference documents and refinement by categories of research areas. This may have led to the loss of content. Thus, if other researchers refined this research using other criteria different results could be found. The research also focused on linking the OCS knowledge area with the CSBs and their results are based on this relationship. Future research can broaden the scope of OCS research using different search criteria, deepen the relationships found between OCSs and CSBs, or explore different relationships between OCSs and sustainability.

Another limitation is related to the lack of empirical validation of the developed framework. However, the relationships contemplated in the framework were developed from mapping the results from previous literature, which materializes its support. Even so, future research may validate the relations between OCS and CSB presented in the framework through empirical research, and, analyzing the practical results of this relationship.
