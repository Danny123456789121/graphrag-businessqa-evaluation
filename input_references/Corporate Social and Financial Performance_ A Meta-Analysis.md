# Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis

# Authors

# Abstract

Most theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions. With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP–CFP relationship than is currently assumed to exist by many business scholars.

# Introduction

The performance of business organizations is affected by their strategies and operations in market and non-market environments (Baron 2000). The increasing power of activist groups and the media in pluralist western societies can be expected to make organizations’ non-market strategies even more important. One construct that might capture a major element of these non-market strategies is corporate social performance (CSP). CSP can be defined as ‘a business organization’s configuration of principles of social responsibility, processes of social responsiveness, and policies, programs, and observable outcomes as they relate to the firm’s societal relationships’ (Wood 1991a: 693).

The impression that ‘in the aggregate, results are inconclusive’ regarding any theoretical conclusions about the relationship between CSP and corporate financial performance (CFP) has persisted until today (Jones and Wicks 1999: 212; cf. also Donaldson 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999). Ullmann (1985) and Wood and Jones (1995) argued that during the past three decades of empirical research on this relationship, researchers have engaged in a futile search for stable causal patterns. A number of narrative reviews and theories (for example, Aupperle et al. 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Husted 2000; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wartick and Cochran 1985; Wood 1991a, 1991b; Wood and Jones 1995) have proposed conceptual explanations for the existence (or lack thereof) of a causal relationship between CSP and CFP, but failed to provide clear answers. Previous reviews of this area have suggested that such factors as stakeholder mismatching (Wood and Jones 1995), the general neglect of contingency factors (for example, Ullmann 1985), and measurement errors (for example, Waddock and Graves 1997) may explain inconsistent findings. Other authors, failing to see important differences between theory and operational context, are even more pessimistic and call for a moratorium of CSP–CFP research (Margolis and Walsh 2001; Rowley and Berman 2000). Before we embark on a costly search for contingencies or abandon a line of inquiry altogether, a theoretically and empirically meaningful integration of this area might be useful. In this article, we argue that this line of inquiry contains a number of theoretical conclusions that have hitherto been overlooked or ignored by many organizational scholars.

This article presents a meta-analytic review of primary quantitative studies of the CSP–CFP relationship. Meta-analysis has proven to be a useful technique in many substantive areas where multiple individual studies have yielded inconclusive or conflicting results (for example, Damanpour 1991; Datta et al. 1992; Gooding and Wagner 1985; Schwenk 1989; see also Hedges 1987; Hunt 1997; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001; and Schmidt 1992 for broader reviews of meta-analysis). By statistically aggregating results across individual studies and correcting for statistical artefacts such as sampling error and measurement error, psychometric meta-analysis allows for much greater precision than other forms of research reviews. Ironically, those researchers that question the meaningfulness of the CSP–CFP research stream the most (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001) have integrated the empirical evidence with the so-called ‘vote-counting’ technique, which, for a variety of reasons, has been shown to be invalid by many statistical experts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Rosenthal 1995; Schmidt 1992). When, in ‘vote counting’, studies are simply coded as showing significantly positive, negative, or statistically non-significant results, conclusions are likely to be false (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In contrast, psychometric meta-analysis quantifies the impact of theoretical and methodological deficiencies in a given line of inquiry and is, therefore, at present, the most sophisticated research-integration technique.

The specific objectives of this meta-analysis are to: (1) provide a statistical integration of the accumulated research on the relationship between CSP and CFP.

CFP; (2) assess the relative predictive validity of instrumental stakeholder theory in the context of the CSP–CFP relationship; and (3) examine several moderators, such as operationalization of CSP and CFP (that is, measurement strategies) and timing of CSP and CFP measurement. In so doing, it builds on earlier research by: (a) including market (stock) return measures in addition to accounting returns; (b) including CSP measures other than social-responsibility audits performed by Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc.; (c) responding to Waddock and Graves’ (1997: 315) call for research on the temporal consistency of results, independent of the time lag chosen between CSP and CFP measures; and (d) integrating empirical results across diverse study contexts and enabling us to look for theoretical moderators and statistical artefacts that might explain the highly variable results across previous studies.

# Theory and Hypotheses

# Overall CSP–CFP Relationship

Instrumental stakeholder theory (for example, Clarkson 1995; Cornell and Shapiro 1987; Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Mitchell et al. 1997 (the classification of these studies as exemplifying ‘instrumental stakeholder theory’ was made ex post)) suggests a positive relationship between CSP and CFP. According to this theory, the satisfaction of various stakeholder groups is instrumental for organizational financial performance (Donaldson and Preston 1995; Jones 1995). Stakeholder-agency theory argues that the implicit and explicit negotiation and contracting processes entailed by reciprocal, bilateral stakeholder–management relationships serve as monitoring and enforcement mechanisms that prevent managers from diverting attention from broad organizational financial goals (Hill and Jones 1992; Jones 1995). Furthermore, by addressing and balancing the claims of multiple stakeholders (Freeman and Evan 1990), managers can increase the efficiency of their organization’s adaptation to external demands.

Additionally, according to a firm-as-contract analysis (Freeman and Evan 1990), high corporate performance results not only from the separate satisfaction of bilateral relationships (Hill and Jones 1992), but also from the simultaneous coordination and prioritization of multilateral stakeholder interests. These strategic and tactical steps may be necessary to reduce the likelihood of the organization’s becoming stuck in a high-density network. High network density can reduce CFP in a number of ways (Rowley 1997). For example, in a high-density network, firms may become stuck in the role of compromiser or subordinate, depending on the degree of the firm’s network centrality (Rowley 1997). Either of these roles may lead to further consumption of valuable firm resources such as time, labour, and capital. Conversely, high CSP bolsters a company’s competitive advantage by weighing and addressing the claims of various constituents in a fair, rational manner. This perspective, which is primarily derived from instrumental.

stakeholder theory (Jones 1995), has also been identified as the ‘good management theory’ (Waddock and Graves 1997). Therefore, we predict that:

# H1:

Corporate social performance and financial performance are generally positively related across a wide variety of industry and study contexts.

# Temporal Sequence

Like the ‘good management theory’, slack resources theory also proposes a positive association between CSP and CFP. However, it proposes a different temporal ordering — namely, that prior CFP is directly associated with subsequent CSP. Prior high levels of CFP may provide the slack resources necessary to engage in corporate social responsibility and responsiveness (Ullmann 1985; Waddock and Graves 1997). Because CSP often represents an area of relatively high managerial discretion, the initiation or cancellation of voluntary social and environmental policies may, to a large extent, depend on the availability of excess funds (McGuire et al. 1988).

To distinguish between slack resources theory and the good management theory, the meta-analytic data set will be examined for three sets of temporal associations: (a) prior CSP related to subsequent CFP; (b) prior CFP related to subsequent CSP; and (c) contemporaneous (cross-sectional) associations. If effect sizes are highly similar across all three meta-analytic subgroups, Waddock and Graves’s (1997) argument about a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP would be supported irrespective of study context, sampling error, and measurement error. Based on prior theory and empirical findings (McGuire et al. 1990; Waddock and Graves 1997), we believe that both instrumental stakeholder theory and slack resources descriptions are accurate, such that the two constructs are related to each other reciprocally.

# H2:

There is bidirectional causality between corporate social performance and financial performance.

# Mediating Effects

CSP may be an organizational resource that provides internal or external benefits, or both. Internally, investments in CSP may help firms develop new competencies, resources, and capabilities which are manifested in a firm’s culture, technology, structure, and human resources (Barney 1991; Russo and Fouts 1997; Wernerfelt 1984). Especially when CSP is pre-emptive (Hart 1995) and a firm’s environment is dynamic or complex, CSP may help build managerial competencies because preventive efforts necessitate significant employee involvement, organization-wide coordination, and a forward-thinking managerial style (Shrivastava 1995). Thus, CSP can help management develop better scanning skills, processes, and information systems, which increase the organization’s preparedness for external changes, turbulence, and crises (for example, Russo and Fouts 1997).

which are acquired internally through the CSP process, would then lead to more efficient utilization of resources (Majumdar and Marcus 2001). According to the ‘internal resources/learning’ perspective, whether CSP behaviours and outcomes are also disclosed to outside constituents is largely irrelevant to the development of internal capabilities and organizational efficiency.

In addition, however, CSP may have external effects on organizational reputation. According to the reputation perspective, an organization’s communication with external parties about its level of CSP may help build a positive image with customers, investors, bankers, and suppliers (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Firms high in CSP may use corporate social responsibility disclosures as one of the informational signals upon which stakeholders base their assessments of corporate reputation under conditions of incomplete information (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Furthermore, firms with high CSP reputation ratings may improve relations with bankers and investors and thus facilitate their access to capital (Spicer 1978). They may also attract better employees (Greening and Turban 2000; Turban and Greening 1997) or increase current employees’ goodwill, which in turn may improve financial outcomes (Davis 1973; McGuire et al. 1988; Waddock and Graves 1997). In sum, the reputation perspective postulates reputational effects as mediators of the CSP–CFP linkage, while the internal-resources perspective proposes managerial competencies and learning as the intervening generative mechanism between a positive CSP–CFP association. Therefore, we propose that:

# H3: CSP is positively correlated with CFP because (a) CSP increases managerial competencies, contributes to organizational knowledge about the firm’s market, social, political, technological, and other environments, and thus enhances organizational efficiency, and (b) CSP helps the firm build a positive reputation and goodwill with its external stakeholders.

# Measurement Strategy: An Important Moderator Variable

Because both CSP and CFP are such broad meta-constructs, a given study’s operationalization of each construct may act as an important moderator. To test this hypothesis, the entire meta-analytic set is broken down into different CFP and CSP subsets employing different measurement strategies. This breakdown can establish whether correlations between different CSP and CFP measures are similar across subgroups, or whether different operationalizations lead to systematically different effect sizes across studies. The following section gives an overview of how CFP and CSP have been measured in the past.

The three broad subdivisions of CFP consist of market-based (investor returns), accounting-based (accounting returns), and perceptual (survey) measures. First, market-based measures of CFP, such as price per share or share price appreciation, reflect the notion that shareholders are a primary stakeholder group whose satisfaction determines the company’s fate (Cochran).

The bidding and asking processes of stock-market participants, who rely on their perceptions of past, current, and future stock returns and risk, determine a firm’s stock price and thus market value. Alternatively, accounting-based indicators, such as the firm’s return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), or earnings per share (EPS), capture a firm’s internal efficiency in some way (Cochran and Wood 1984). Accounting returns are subject to managers’ discretionary allocations of funds to different projects and policy choices, and thus reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external market responses to organizational (non-market) actions. Lastly, perceptual measures of CFP ask survey respondents to provide subjective estimates of, for instance, the firm’s ‘soundness of financial position’, ‘wise use of corporate assets’, or ‘financial goal achievement relative to competitors’ (Conine and Madden 1987; Reimann 1975; Wartick 1988).

The construct of CSP is associated with the following four broad measurement strategies: (a) CSP disclosures; (b) CSP reputation ratings; (c) social audits, CSP processes, and observable outcomes; and (d) managerial CSP principles and values (Post 1991). First, CSP disclosure measurement consists of content analysis of annual reports, letters to shareholders, 10Ks, and a number of other corporate disclosures to the public as surrogates of CSP. Content analysis is employed to compare units of text against particular CSP themes in order to draw inferences about the organization’s underlying social performance (Wolfe 1991).

A second approach to measuring CSP is the use of reputational indices, such as Moskowitz’s (1972, 1975) tripartite ratings (‘outstanding’, ‘honourable mention’, and ‘worst’ companies; for example, Cochran and Wood 1984; Sturdivant and Ginter 1977) or Fortune magazine ratings of a corporation’s ‘responsibility to the community and environment’ (for example, Conine and Madden 1987; Fombrun and Shanley 1990; McGuire et al. 1988). Other researchers (Alexander and Buchholz 1978; Heinze 1976; Vance 1975) have developed their own reputational measures by surveying business professionals and business students. Reputation indices are based on the assumption that CSP reputations are good reflections of underlying CSP values and behaviours.

Social audits and concrete observable CSP processes and outcomes are the third broad measurement category of CSP. Social audits consist of a systematic third-party effort to assess a firm’s ‘objective’ CSP behaviours, such as community service, environmental programmes, and corporate philanthropy. Objective data are the foundation for so-called ‘behavioural’ measures of CSP. However, behavioural measures based on social audits may still result in a ranking, such as the measure provided by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP). Various studies have used the CEP social audit rankings of companies’ pollution records (for example, Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Fogler and Nutt 1975; Spicer 1978; see also the overview of studies in Appendix A). Although this subset of studies differs from the other three subsets, it is still very broad. Therefore, this third group will be broken down further to examine the instrumental effectiveness of processes of social responsiveness.

The fourth measurement category of CSP assesses the values and principles inherent in a company’s culture. Aupperle (1984) developed a forced-choice survey of corporate social orientations, drawing on Carroll’s (1979) corporate social responsibility construct with its four dimensions of economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities. The last three elements comprise the construct ‘concern for society’. Volume 12 of Research in Corporate Social Performance and Policy (Post 1991: Part III, 265–401) reviews in greater depth the history and psychometric properties of the different CSP measures briefly delineated here (Aupperle 1991; Carroll 1991; Clarkson 1991; Gephardt 1991; Wokutch and McKinney 1991; Wolfe 1991; Wolfe and Aupperle 1991).

Differences in CSP–CFP statistical associations across these four measurement subsets may result from three sources. First, there might be ‘real’ (substantive) cross-study variation in correlations between CSP and CFP, as predicted by Wood and Jones’s (1995) mismatching thesis. Wood and Jones (1995) argued that effects would vary depending on expectations and evaluations of CSP, which differ from one stakeholder group to another. No positive correlations would be expected between measures that cannot be linked theoretically, such as CSP disclosures and accounting-based efficiency measures of CFP. For example, Wood and Jones’s (1995) review suggested that the match between market measures and market-oriented stakeholders (for example, customers) would produce significant positive results, while the correlation between market measures and charitable contributions, for instance, would not.

Alternatively, differences in correlations across variable measurement subsets may simply be a function of statistical artefacts. For example, if one measurement subgroup were found to contain many studies with very small sample sizes, this subgroup would show a relatively large random sampling error. Thus, differences in sampling error across measurement subgroups may explain CSP/CFP correlational differences in primary studies. In addition, measurement error of CFP and CSP (that is, unreliability) might act as another artefactual source of cross-study variability in correlations. If, for example, CSP disclosure measures were plagued by comparatively low psychometric quality (for example, Abbott and Monsen 1979; Ingram and Frazier 1980; Wiseman 1982), observed correlations between CSP disclosures and CFP would be systematically lower than the correlations between CFP and other, more reliable measures of CSP. Therefore, this meta-analysis hierarchically breaks down the overall data set in order to compare the relative magnitudes of correlations arising from different CSP and CFP measurement subcategories, and to test for these three possible sources of cross-study variation of correlations (substantive differences, sampling error, and measurement error). We hypothesize that:

# H4a:

A large proportion of cross-study variance is due to statistical or methodological artefacts (sampling error and measurement error).

# H4b:

Consistent with stakeholder mismatching, after accounting for statistical artefacts, there will still be differences in the statistical associations between different sub-dimensions of CFP and CSP (after correct matching).

# Methods

Prior summaries of the CSP–CFP literature have relied mostly on narrative reviews (for example, Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985) or the vote-counting method of aggregation (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995). Narrative reviews are literature reviews that attempt to make sense of past findings verbally or conceptually. The vote-counting method refers to the cumulation of significance levels or, in the simplest case, to the tabulation of significant and non-significant findings (Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Light and Smith 1971). Both of these research integration techniques tend to draw false inferences because they do not correct for sampling and measurement error, two important study artefacts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In fact, the statistical errors in the typical ‘vote-counting’ literature review tend to be more serious than in the average narrative review because the statistical power of the vote-counting procedure decreases with increasing.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

number of studies reviewed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Although we have known for more than 20 years that vote counting is marred by a lack of validity, the technique is still widely used today (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995).

In contrast, effect-size (r) meta-analysis is a rigorous approach to external validation, which calculates population parameter estimates (ρ) by correcting for the aforementioned artefacts. The effect of sampling error is important because sample sizes that are smaller than the population cause observed sample correlation statistics r to vary randomly from the population parameter, the true-score correlation ρ. In addition, as mentioned before, measurement error (that is, unreliability) systematically attenuates observed correlations (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994).

# Search for Relevant Studies

Computer searches of ABI/Inform Global and PsycINFO were conducted, using the keyword search ‘organizational effectiveness and corporate social performance’. Synonyms for the former, used in separate computer searches, were ‘organizational performance’, ‘profitability’, ‘economic success’, and ‘financial performance’. ‘Corporate social performance’ as a keyword search term was alternately substituted with ‘(corporate) social responsibility’, ‘corporate environmental performance’, ‘responsiveness’, and simply ‘resp?’. ABI/Inform Global gives access to the full text and images of more than 1,200 US and international business and trade journal articles (1970-current), while PsycINFO indexes abstracts of journal articles and book chapters in psychology starting in 1974. To increase the scope of our search, cross-citations from previous narrative reviews (for example, Aldag and Bartol 1978; McGuire et al. 1988: 857 –860; Preston 1978a; Waddock and Mahon 1991; Wood and Jones 1995) were explored as well.

# Criteria for Relevance

The studies that were deemed relevant for the meta-analysis had the following characteristics. First, the studies quantitatively examined the relationship between CSP and CFP. The reported effect size did not have to be a Pearsons’ product-moment correlation r, but could also be a t-test statistic or effect size t d (both t and d can be transformed to r; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Second, the studies were concerned with at least one aspect of a firm’s economic performance, as circumscribed by the definition of CFP. For the purpose of this study, CFP was defined as a company’s financial viability, or the extent to which a company achieves its economic goals (Price and Mueller 1986; Venkatraman and Ramanujam 1986). Third, all retrieved studies were double-checked for conformance to Wood’s (1991a) definition of CSP (see Introduction above). Wood’s (1991a) now classic definition is used because it is one of the most influential, helpful, parsimonious, and yet comprehensive conceptualizations of CSP. If the particular variable could not be classified.

# 24(3)

as an example belonging to one of the nine subcategories of Wood’s model, the study was excluded. In addition, unclear reporting of empirical results was also a reason for exclusion.

Studies of environmental management and CFP are included in the meta-analysis for several reasons. First, several studies, especially earlier ones, use environmental performance as a proxy for social responsibility. Second, stakeholder proxies, such as environmental interest groups and government agencies, may in fact give voice to, or claim a social ‘stake’ for, non-human nature (Starik 1995). Lastly, the business community tends to regard social responsibility as including both social and environmental performance (for example, Willums 1999). Still, the argument can be made that the literature on CSP differs from the one on corporate environmental performance in various aspects. To investigate differences between social and environmental performance, the entire set (k = number of effect sizes integrated = 388) is disaggregated into purely social performance measures only (that is, excluding all environmental performance measures; k = 249) and environmental measures only (k = 139).

# Characteristics of Primary Studies

The most important study characteristics, such as author(s), date of study, study sample size N i, observed r or transformed and/or partially corrected r (that is, corrected for dichotomization and unequal sample sizes in the two groups compared in a t-test), number of correlations per study, operationalization of CSP and CFP, and estimates of reliability are listed in Appendix A.

Reliability is traditionally defined as the ratio of true-score variance to observed-score variance (Traub 1994). Thus, classical measurement theory is concerned with the correspondence between observed scores and true scores. Some of the reliability coefficients used in this study are in the tradition of classical reliability theory, such as coefficient alpha. Sometimes, however, it becomes necessary to count not only variation due to item sampling, but also day-to-day variation in scores as measurement error. In classical theory, one can accomplish this task by using an alternate-forms coefficient of reliability. Generalizability theory is less restrictive in its assumptions than classical theory (Cronbach et al. 1972). The coefficient of generalizability reflects the degree to which observed scores (of CSP or CFP in this case) allow for generalization about a firm’s behaviour in a defined universe of situations (Cronbach et al. 1972; Shavelson et al. 1989). Generalizability is estimated through ‘alternate-forms’ correlations between different CSP, and CFP, measures.

The present study estimates reliability by including coefficients of generalizability (76 percent), stability (4 percent), internal reliability (8 percent), and inter-rater reliability (12 percent). Both stability and generalizability coefficients are underestimates of reliability (Orlitzky 1998). Because of the predominance of coefficients of stability and generalizability, the meta-analysis provides conservative estimates (that is, lower-bound estimates) of the reliability of the CSP or CFP measurement instrument.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

In addition to listing the reliabilities of both constructs, Appendix A shows the great variety of study contexts and operationalizations of both constructs. From the vantage point of generating cumulative knowledge, multiple operationism is an advantage because it helps determine whether a ‘true’ relationship exists in different industry contexts with different operationalizations of the two focal constructs (Cook and Campbell 1979; Cooper 1989; Webb et al. 1981). In past meta-analyses, integrated studies often contained broad meta-constructs as well, such as job or organizational performance, operationalized in many different ways (for example, Gooding and Wagner 1985; Ketchen et al. 1997; Roth et al. 1996; Wagner and Gooding 1987). During data collection, the inclusion criteria for relevance (see above) served as constant checks on the operationalizations’ conformance to the broad conceptual definitions of CSP and CFP.

Empirically, the standard deviation of ρ serves as an indicator of cross-study heterogeneity. The percentage of cross-study variance explained by artefacts is another indicator of the degree of cross-study generalizability (Hunter and Schmidt 1990).

# Statistical Conventions Used in the Meta-analysis

The meta-analysis uses Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) statistical aggregation techniques for cumulating correlations and correcting for various study artefacts in order to estimate the true score correlation (ρ) between CSP and CFP. Meta-analysis arrives at a mean true-score correlation by correcting observed correlations for sampling error (which can be written as σe = (1−ρ2) / (N−1)) and for measurement error. Since sampling error varies directly with sample size, all studies are weighted by sample size Ni before correcting for the average attenuation factor (Schmidt and Hunter 1977).

Because measurement error data points are not always available for individual studies (see Appendix A), study correlations cannot be corrected individually for measurement error. Instead, correlations are meta-analysed using artefact distributions (for more details on artefact-distribution meta-analysis, see Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The moderator analyses use Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) subgrouping algorithm, as described in the Results section below.

Non-independence in any meta-analytic data set can present certain problems. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted by using two other aggregation techniques. In the first sensitivity analysis, we used only one independent correlation per study, that is, composite scores. Furthermore, a second sensitivity analysis tested the stability of our transformations of effect sizes (reported t or d statistics into r).

After correction for sampling and measurement errors, the true score (corrected) correlation (ρ) was .36, which is twice the size of the observed correlation, with a variance (.19), which is slightly more than three times the size of the observed variance. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the relationship remains positive even after we removed studies that may be affected by response bias (survey measures of CFP) and halo (CSP reputation indices; Brown and Perry 1994); the remaining meta-analytic set showed an average observed correlation of .08 and a true-score correlation of .15. Although this true-score correlation is smaller than in the larger set including CSP reputation and CFP survey measures, it is not trivial. Thus, the meta-analytic findings support hypothesis H1.

The sensitivity analyses tend to confirm this conclusion. The first sensitivity analysis, which uses only one effect size per study (thus, k = 52, N = 4924), showed a mean observed correlation of .21 and a corrected correlation of .42. The second sensitivity analysis, on 210 product-moment correlations (k) with a total sample size of 22,218 observations (N), also showed slightly higher estimates (robs = .20, ρ = .41) than the overall meta-analysis reported in Table 1. Thus, in both ‘sensitivity’ meta-analyses (not reported in the tables), the mean observed and corrected correlations were positive and of similar magnitude as the correlations in the entire meta-analytic set. If anything, the sensitivity analyses suggest that our meta-analytic estimates are actually conservative estimates of the relationships between CSP and CFP.

# Corporate Social and Environmental Performance

Table 1 also shows analyses for two different conceptualizations of CSP. When the entire meta-analytic set was divided into two sets, that is, (a) those studies using a narrow definition of ‘social’ performance (thus excluding measures of environmental performance; k = 249, N = 24,055) and (b) studies of corporate environmental performance only (k = 139, N = 9823), the findings show that corporate environmental performance has a smaller relationship with CFP (robs = .06, ρ = .12) than do all other measures of CSP (robs = .23, ρ = .47), such as managerial principles and corporate reputations for minority hiring, for example. In the corporate environmental performance subset, the variances of observed and true-score correlations were also smaller than those in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Furthermore, measurement error and sampling error explained more of the cross-study variance of robs in the corporate environmental performance subset than in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Thus, the last two lines of Table 1 (entries 3.a and 3.b) demonstrate that the relatively lower correlation between corporate environmental performance and CFP is, in fact, much more consistent across industry and study contexts than the primary empirical studies would have us believe.

bias. Availability bias is one of the most common criticisms levelled against meta-analysis, in that critics of meta-analysis often suspect that published studies will report larger effect sizes than unpublished studies. File drawer analysis addresses this issue by computing the number of additional unlocated (that is, ‘lost’ or overlooked) studies needed to cause the correlation to decrease to a minimal critical level (r crit), which is set at .05 in this study. Hunter and Schmidt (1990) present the underlying assumptions and techniques of file drawer analysis. For each correlation computed in Tables 1–4, the results of the file drawer analysis are presented in the last column. As shown in Table 1, a very large number of studies (1,037) would be needed to change the overall substantive conclusions of this meta-analysis (entry 1 in Table 1).

# Temporal Sequence

Tables 2a and 2b show the results relevant to Hypothesis 2, which suggested a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP. Consistent with that hypothesis, the primary studies supported the instrumental stakeholder and slack resources theories to about the same degree. Specifically, both the prior CFP and subsequent CFP subsets yielded observed correlations of .15, and corrected correlations of .29 (first two lines in Table 2a). Concurrent studies yielded observed and corrected correlations with CFP of .22 and .44, respectively (third line of Table 2a). Taken together, these findings suggest a virtuous cycle with quick cycle times or concurrent bidirectionality. However, the low percentages of observed cross-study variance explained by artefacts, ranging from 20 percent to 26 percent, and large true-score variances ranging from .17 to .19, indicate the presence of at least one moderator. As Table 2b shows, consistent with the overall analysis (Table 1, entries 3.a and 3.b), the results are stronger after corporate environmental measures were removed from CSP. Generally, though, the relationships reported in Table 2b confirm the conclusions of Table 2a.

# Mediator Variables: Learning and Reputation

To investigate Hypothesis 3, studies were divided into two broad subsets: (a) studies that correlated both internal and external measures of CSP with only accounting CFP measures (that is, measures of internal resource utilization, such as ROA or ROE); and (b) studies which correlated only externally visible measures of CSP, such as CSP reputation or disclosures, with exclusively external (for example, market return or sales growth) measures of CFP. The reputational argument is further subdivided into studies correlating external indicators of CFP with: (a) reputation indices of CSP; (b) CSP disclosures in annual reports and letters to shareholders; and (c) other externally visible measures of CSP such as social audits and charitable contributions.

Based on the magnitude of the meta-analytic correlations, the meta-analysed studies support the reputation-effects viewpoint relatively more strongly than the internal viewpoint, as shown in Table 3 (compare first two).

lines in Table 3, that is, entry 1 with entry 2). In addition, further hierarchical breakdown of the reputation view subset indicates that CSP disclosures appear to have a low reputational impact on CFP. This statistical conclusion is generalizable across study settings because a high proportion of variance (93 percent) is explained by study artefacts (entry 2.b in Table 3). Moreover, timing of measurement (temporal sequence) is not an important moderator within the ‘reputation view’ argument. As was the case in the overall meta-analysis, the correlations between CSP and subsequent CFP are almost identical to the ones found between CSP and prior CFP (ρ = .75 and .73, respectively; entries 2.a.1 and 2.a.2 in Table 3). Again, the correlations are highest when CSP and CFP were measured less than a year apart (ρ = .91, and 51 percent of cross-study variance explained by artefacts; entry 2.a.3).

# Moderator Analysis

The analyses relevant to Hypothesis 3 already alluded to an important feature of Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) meta-analytic technique; namely, detection of cross-study moderators. Because this algorithm will be used extensively in the remaining meta-analyses, a brief explanation seems in order. Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) moderator analysis consists of two distinct methods. First, the ‘75% rule’ can be applied, stating that if 75 percent or more of the observed variance of correlations across studies is due to artefacts, then probably all of it is artefactual variance (on the grounds that the remaining 25 percent is likely due to artefacts not corrected for). Thus, in cases where 75 percent or more of the variance is explained by artefacts, including sampling error variance, moderators are unlikely to have caused a real variation in observed correlations (robs). This first method is able to detect the existence of unsuspected moderators.

The second method, which can detect discontinuous, theoretically predicted moderators, compares mean observed and true-score correlations across study domain subsets of the original entire set of studies aggregated in the meta-analysis. If in these meta-analytic subgroups, a higher percentage of variance is accounted for by study artefacts relative to the entire meta-analytic set, moderators are said to exist.

# Measurement Strategy as Moderator

To examine Hypotheses 4a and 4b, the entire data set of 388 correlations was broken down hierarchically to investigate the presence of moderator effects based on the operationalizations of CSP and CFP (see Table 4a). First, CFP and CSP operationalizations were disaggregated separately. Second, the four broad CSP operationalization subsets were broken down hierarchically into the two (or three, where available) CFP measurement categories. The lowest level in Table 4a is the only one that is not confounded by lack of standardized measurement and, thus, is the most informative.

In general, Table 4a indicates that the association between CSP and CFP depends on the firm’s or researcher’s operational definition of each construct, or both. Accounting measures were more highly correlated with CSP than.

Market-based measures (ρ = .42 as against .15; entries 1.b versus 1.a in Table 4a), and were particularly highly correlated with CSP reputation indices (ρ = .61; entry 2.b.2). In fact, overall the findings with respect to CSP operationalizations suggest that studies that used reputation indices as proxies for CSP showed the highest average correlation with CFP (ρ of .73 with a large variance of .19; entry 2.b in Table 4a). Of course, this high correlation may partially be due to halo (Brown and Perry 1994).

Furthermore, repeating the pattern of results testing reputation-theory effects (Table 3), disclosure measures appear to be only minimally related to CFP (robs = .04, ρ = .09, as shown in entry 2.a). This finding is generalizable because almost all the observed variance is explained by artefacts. Social audits, CSP processes, and outcomes are only modestly correlated with CFP (robs = .09, ρ = .18; entry 2.c). Similar mean correlations were found for the relationship between corporate social responsibility values or attitudes and CFP (robs = .10, ρ = .21; entry 2.d). The second level in the hierarchical breakdown supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study artefacts, stakeholder mismatching, other theoretical mis-specifications, or lack of theory (cf. also McWilliams and Siegel 2000). As discussed above, the overall percentage of cross-study variance (in robs) explained is 24 percent. In general, this percentage tends to increase in the measurement subgroups listed in Table 4a, which suggests that studies systematically differ with respect to the distortions caused by (previously uncorrected) statistical and methodological artefacts. The fact that artefacts account for 15 –100 percent of cross-study variance (the notorious ‘inconsistencies’ of this research stream) provides support for Hypothesis 4a.

The support for theoretical inconsistencies (stakeholder mismatching) becomes apparent by looking at some second-level hierarchical subgroups. First, the correlation of CSP disclosure measures with accounting CFP measures is slightly negative (ρ = –.02; entry 2.a.2). This small correlation supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis because there is no theoretical causal mechanism between CSP disclosures and internal (that is, accounting) CFP measures. Second, the observed and corrected correlations between (a) social audit and other observable or ‘objective’ (for example, dollar amount of charitable contributions) measures of CSP processes and (b) market-based measures of CFP are close to zero (Table 4a, entry 2.c.1), which again supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis. As Wood and Jones (1995: 242) argued earlier, ‘There is no theory to explain why stockholders would or would not prefer a company that gives one percent of pre-tax earnings to charity, that hires and develops minority or women workers, or that ranks higher in pollution control indices.’ In other words, the data suggest that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioural measures of CSP (such as charitable donations), perhaps because they are perceived as direct attempts by firms to manage external impressions.

To examine the measurement moderators within subgroup 2.c even more closely, Table 4b shows results for social audits disaggregated from other CSP behaviours, which are further broken down.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

worthy. First, social audits were consistently, but only modestly, correlated with CFP (ρ = .23, 100 percent of cross-study variance explained). Second, across industry contexts, philanthropic donations were related with CFP at ρ = .29, which was higher than the respective correlation coefficients found for all other measures of CSP behaviours. However, the file drawer analyses (last column of Table 4b) suggest that some of the findings presented in Table 4b are not conclusive because a small number of additional studies could change our conclusions.

# Discussion

# Theoretical Implications

Based on this meta-analysis integrating 30 years of research, the answer to the introductory question posed by Business Week is affirmative. The results of this meta-analysis show that there is a positive association between CSP and CFP across industries and across study contexts. In that sense, we can confirm Frooman’s (1997) conclusions, based on event studies, supporting the validity of enlightened self-interest in the social responsibility arena. The data accumulated over the past 30 years do not support the latest contingency theory in the area of corporate social responsibility (McWilliams and Siegel 2001). Like earlier research reviews, McWilliams and Siegel (2001) take inconsistent findings in primary studies at face value (that is, ignore the possible impact of sampling error and measurement error) and explain the (apparent) inconsistency with a demand/supply model of corporate social responsibility. Moreover, the temporal analysis of our meta-analysis shows that the positive association between CFP and lagged CSP (slack resources argument) does not mask a weaker negative association between CSP and lagged CFP.

Can CSP be motivated by an ‘ecological selection process based on profit maximization or organizational survival’ (Wholey and Brittain 1986, in Husted 2000: 33)? Husted (2000: 34) agrees with the narrative reviews in this area, stating that it is ‘premature’ to conclude that adaptation to market and non-market environments might force organizations to consider social issues and CSP in their day-to-day strategizing. Our meta-analysis suggests the opposite. In fact, some of our observed correlations are higher than the correlations typically found between strategy-structure fit and CFP (Amburgey and Dacin 1994; Donaldson 1987). Despite those lower correlations, the strategy-structure-performance paradigm is firmly grounded on an economic survival mechanism (across industry contexts) analogous to Hypothesis 1. On the one hand, our meta-analysis contradicts Rowley and Berman’s (2000) suggestion that there cannot be a consistently positive relationship between CSP and CFP. On the other hand, in agreement with Rowley and Berman (2000), we demonstrate that the universally positive relationship varies (from highly positive to modestly positive) because of contingencies, such as reputation effects, market measures of CFP, or CSP disclosures.

Traditionally, researchers have worried that any positive correlations are artefactual, due to halo effects (Brown and Perry 1994, 1995; Wood 1995). However, it is important to keep in mind that the only credible halo linkage would be from CFP to CSP; that is, companies that perform better financially receive higher CSP ratings, regardless of their true underlying CSP. The meta-analytic breakdown has shown that the potential halo effect (CFP → lagged CSP correlation) does not dominate a weaker CSP → lagged CFP correlation and distort results. In fact, the two correlations are identical at two digits (.29, see Table 2a). Also, when all potentially problematic studies are removed (that is, those that measure CSP reputations only and those that measure CFP with a survey instrument), the meta-analysis still shows a non-trivial positive ‘true-score’ correlation of .15 (see Table 1). Furthermore, the halo argument would suggest a much higher correlation between external (market) CFP and CSP reputation than between internal (accounting) CFP and CSP reputation. In fact, however, the correlations in both subgroups were similar (entries 2.b.1 versus 2.b.2 in Table 4a).

When the CFP survey measures and CSP reputation measures are removed, the cross-study variation of robs can be shown to be increasingly a function of the artefacts of sampling and measurement error (44 percent; see entry 2 in Table 1). Thus, many of the negative findings in individual studies are artefactual, so that the generalization of a positive CSP –CFP relationship applies more broadly than previously suggested (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995). We can, therefore, state with some confidence that the association between CSP and lagged CFP is not negative. Moreover, the causation seems to be that CSP and CFP mutually affect each other through a virtuous cycle: financially successful companies spend more because they can afford it, but CSP also helps them become a bit more successful. Moreover, the le drawer analysis indicates that the present findings cannot be dismissed by availability bias.

This meta-analysis both rejects and confirms notions developed by neo-classical economists. On the one hand, it rejects the idea that CSP is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization (Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958). Instead, organizational effectiveness may be a broad concept encompassing both financial and social performance (Andrews 1987; Judge 1994). It is also worth noting that, according to most credible versions of stakeholder theory, shareholders are legitimate stakeholders. On the other hand, our findings also confirm the notions of libertarians such as Friedman that government regulation in the area of CSP may not be necessary. If the statistical relationship between CSP and CFP were negative, bottom-line considerations might constitute barriers to outcomes desired by the public, which in turn would make government intervention, which serves the public ‘interest’, a necessity. Yet, with CSP, the case for regulation and social control by governments (acting on behalf of ‘society’ or ‘the public’) is relatively weak because organizations and their shareholders tend to benefit from managers’ prudent analysis, evaluation, and balancing of multiple constituents’ preferences. Therefore, these actions are most likely adopted.

voluntarily, based on managers’ cost-benefit analyses of a firm’s investments. In contrast, ‘socially responsible’ command-and-control regulation may prescribe inflexible means–ends chains that are inappropriate for a particular firm’s non-market and market environments (Majumdar and Marcus 2001).

# Implications for Future Research

The meta-analysis helps to identify areas in which there have been relatively few studies conducted, and which warrant more research (for example, social responsibility values and market CFP; see Table 4a). Additionally, the analysis shows areas in which the unexplained variance across studies remains relatively large, so that further inquiry is needed to identify moderators (for example, CSP reputation measures and market-based CFP; see Table 4a).

Moreover, Appendix A shows that the field must make a concerted effort to improve the reliability of CSP and CFP measures. In several subgroups, the percentage of variance of r obs explained by measurement error (that is, low reliability) was substantial. In addition to psychometric refinements, CSP researchers must decide whether CSP ‘processes’ should really be regarded as a social performance measure. Including processes is equivalent to acknowledging effort. More broadly, some readers may share the authors’ concern that previous studies were over-inclusive with respect to definitions of stakeholders and, thus, the CSP proxies (cf. also Roman et al. 1999). We would argue that in future studies, only social and environmental performance ‘outcomes’ should count as CSP and that the concept of ‘stakeholder’ must be more restrictive than it currently is.

Another concern that may be raised concerns the different variable CSP measures. This issue needs to be examined in future theoretical and empirical work. We believe that CSP, like CFP, is a valid theoretical construct — admittedly a meta-construct — which can be measured in a variety of ways. Like Meyer and Gupta (1994), we see the possible independence of the operationalizations as a natural outcome of differences in organizational strategies, structures, and environments. Moreover, we share the view of many meta-analysts (for example, Cooper 1989; Dalton et al. 1999; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Smith and Glass 1977) that broad constructs can, and should, be operationalized in a number of ways. As long as researchers’ choices of CSP (and CFP) measures are informed by prior judgments of their theoretical meaningfulness and subjected to peer review, then relatively low correlations across measurement categories do not present an obstacle to research integration. More important to the present case, however, is that our review of CSP generalizability coefficients shows that different CSP measures are, in fact, rather highly correlated (average rxx = .71; Appendix A). In other words, conceptual speculations about the impossibility of meaningful integration of prior research are not supported by empirical evidence (for a detailed review of this topic, cf. Orlitzky 1998).

Overall, we reach very different conclusions than Margolis and Walsh (2001). Although we agree with some of their more definitive conclusions as to a positive CSP–CFP relationship, we also argue that our data analysis.

# Organization Studies

shows that interesting questions remain. The research effort does not have to be abandoned because of poor theory or poor methods in this line of inquiry. We are particularly concerned with the conclusions of Margolis and Walsh (2001) because their criticism of other studies is argued from the vantage point of a method (the ‘vote-counting’ literature review) whose lack of validity has been known for more than 20 years (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). First, they do not take into account sampling and measurement errors. Moreover, their review relies on a binary world-view, which holds that a relationship between CSP and CFP either exists (if results are statistically positive, or negative) or does not exist (if results are mixed or statistically non-significant, which they falsely call ‘zero’ effects (cf. Cohen 1990, 1994)). The relationship between business and society is too important theoretically to base our conclusions on methodologically ill-advised research reviews.

# Implications for Managers

Despite previous assumptions of inconclusive findings (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995), we can legitimately derive implications for corporate strategy from the meta-analysis. First and foremost, market forces generally do not penalize companies that are high in corporate social performance; thus, managers can afford to be socially responsible. If managers believe that CSP is an antecedent of CFP, they may eventually actively pursue CSP because they think the market will reward them for doing so. Top managers must learn to use CSP as a reputational lever (ρ= .73) and be attentive to the perceptions of third parties, regardless of whether they are market analysts, public interest groups, or the media. Whereas social audits in and of themselves are only moderately beneficial (ρ = .23), a company that is high in CSP may especially benefit from receiving public endorsement from federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As Fombrun (1996) suggested, the key to reaping benefits from CSP is a return from reputation (cf. also Roberts and Dowling 2002).

As findings about the positive relationships between CSP and CFP become more widely known, managers may be more likely to pursue CSP as part of their strategy for attaining high CFP. These strategic management considerations would be consistent with Baron’s (2000) managerial approach to the business–society interface. Baron (2000) argues that successful executives are able to integrate market strategies with non-market strategies in order to position their firm for optimal effectiveness. Baron’s (2000) book offers guidelines as to how firms can strategically achieve this integration in a number of areas (such as the news media, activists, social movements, legislatures, ethics, and so on). Alternatively, social performance may increase through less deliberate decision processes, as firms emulate others that are experiencing high financial success (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Either evolutionary process would reduce the importance of coercive control.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

mechanisms (in the form of government regulations) for effecting public welfare and ecological sustainability. If the mental models of managers and regulators moved to this more libertarian framework, the primary role of regulations would be their signalling function with respect to prioritizing certain issues and certain constituents’ claims over others.

# Conclusion

Theoretically, portraying managers’ choices with respect to CSP and CFP as an either/or trade-off is not justified in light of 30 years of empirical data. This meta-analysis has shown that (1) across studies, CSP is positively correlated with CFP, (2) the relationship tends to be bidirectional and simultaneous, (3) reputation appears to be an important mediator of the relationship, and (4) stakeholder mismatching, sampling error, and measurement error can explain between 15 percent and 100 percent of the cross-study variation in various subsets of CSP–CFP correlations. Corporate virtue in the form of social and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is rewarding in more ways than one.
