SAP also uniquely understands the complex business processes and semantic relationships underpinning our customer data. ## Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio\\n\\nThe world is sitting on the cusp of the next great technological revolution, driven by fast-moving advances in artificial intelligence (AI). AI extends the reach of computers by understanding unstructured data and addressing problems too complex for deterministic programming and rules. Now, generative AI is rapidly unlocking previously unimaginable capabilities, such as generating code based on natural language input and answering questions from the context that is flowing through business systems. This creates an imperative for SAP to deliver more value to our customers and transform SAP’s products into an AI-powered portfolio. SAP is at the forefront of this technological wave, uniquely combining generative AI with business data. We are committed to providing AI solutions that are integral to our customers' most critical business processes, ensuring they are built-in, relevant, and responsible.\\n\\nWhen our customers aspire to clean the ocean, transform industries, or redefine the future of work, SAP stands alongside with technology and applications that are not just innovative, but also deeply integrated with AI, to turn these visions into reality.\\n\\n# The What\\n## Our Vision\\nTo bring out the best in every business.\\n\\nOur vision reflects our commitment to transform organizations globally. We are building a future where businesses not only adapt rapidly to changes but also embed sustainability in their operations and drive greater productivity. Our three pillars of commitment underline this vision: - **Unleash SAP’s ecosystem.** SAP’s more than 25,500 strong partners play a critical role in helping our customers adopt available AI features. Besides teaming up with general-purpose AI platforms (such as Databricks and AWS SageMaker) and LLM providers (such as Microsoft Azure Open AI service), we also empower partners to build AI-powered extensions, add-ons, and applications on SAP BTP to fulfill specific customer needs. We must help systems integrators apply generative AI to condense cloud transformation projects.\\n\\n- **Make AI simple for customers to consume and for SAP to position.** Customers care about business value, not technology, while at the same time harboring fears and misunderstandings about AI. We must clearly communicate the business value of AI features and make it simple – commercially and technically – for customers to activate. Customers will either get basic AI as part of their existing SAP cloud subscriptions or with a premium add-on.\", 'ground_truth': 'SAP can leverage its extensive data assets by embedding AI capabilities into its customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

      "## Economic Impact of Generative AI on the Global Economy\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI is projected to have a profound impact on the global economy, with estimates suggesting it may add trillions of dollars in value. This technology is expected to enhance productivity across various sectors, driving economic growth and reshaping the economic landscape. The transformative capabilities of generative AI are likely to lead to increased efficiency and innovation, which are critical for the overall economic dynamics [Data: Reports (26)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Drivers of Economic Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "The anticipated economic benefits of generative AI stem from its ability to create new product categories and streamline processes. By automating tasks, generative AI is expected to open up new markets and significantly contribute to overall economic development. The relationship between generative AI and economic performance indicates that technological advancements will play a crucial role in shaping future economic trends [Data: Reports (17, 19, 10, 33, 27, +more)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Regional Adoption and Investment Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States is positioned to adopt generative AI technologies more rapidly than other countries, primarily due to higher wage levels that incentivize investment in automation. Between 2020 and 2022, approximately $8 billion was invested in generative AI-related companies in the U.S., highlighting the country's leadership in this sector [Data: Reports (28)]. Similarly, developed countries such as France, Germany, and Japan are also expected to adopt these technologies swiftly, which may lead to significant changes in their labor markets and productivity levels [Data: Reports (29)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Research and Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations like McKinsey & Company and the McKinsey Global Institute are conducting extensive research on the economic implications of generative AI. Their studies focus on how this technology can enhance productivity and create value across various sectors, including banking and retail. This research is essential for understanding the broader economic landscape influenced by generative AI and its effects on labor markets [Data: Reports (17, 19, 27)].\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, generative AI is poised to be a transformative force in the global economy, with substantial potential to enhance productivity, create new markets, and drive economic growth across various sectors. The ongoing research and investment trends indicate a strong commitment to harnessing the benefits of this technology, which shall be crucial for future economic development.\n"
