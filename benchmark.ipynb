Since then, we have seen great progress in its evolution and further confirmation that this strategy is more relevant than ever. Businesses of all sizes continue to look to us as their trusted partner in helping them, industries, and entire nations become agile, achieve more across their value chains, and reach sustainability at their core.\\n\\n## Strategic Context 2024\\nWe are being challenged by the biggest transformation in our industry for decades which is driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), competitive pressure, and a changing macroeconomic environment with parts of the world in turmoil:', 'We use these strengths to our advantage, focusing on three strategic priorities that guide our product strategy:\\n\\n- Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio\\n- Build and run the leading suite for every business with Cloud ERP and BTP, complemented by HXM, ISBN, and CX\\n- Accelerate business-driven innovation and scale our New Growth Areas\\n\\n## Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio\\n\\nThe world is sitting on the cusp of the next great technological revolution, driven by fast-moving advances in artificial intelligence (AI). AI extends the reach of computers by understanding unstructured data and addressing problems too complex for deterministic programming and rules. Now, generative AI is rapidly unlocking previously unimaginable capabilities, such as generating code based on natural language input and answering questions from the context that is flowing through business systems. This creates an imperative for SAP to deliver more value to our customers and transform SAP’s products into an AI-powered portfolio.', 'The speed of cloud delivery combined with the ability to integrate sustainability data into the core ERP system will optimize customers’ sustainability and financial performance and form the foundation for their future business success. Only SAP can provide enterprises with this holistic capability to make sustainability a driver for business transformation, with cloud the enabler of the agility needed to leverage continuous innovations – and evolving AI-powered sustainability use cases – delivered by SAP.\\n\\n## Business AI\\nOur ambition is to become the market leader in Business AI by scaling AI across our entire product portfolio. Therefore, we establish Business AI as a dedicated New Growth Area in the Office of the CEO.
