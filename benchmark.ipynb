When we execute with conviction and as a team, this environment will be an advantage for SAP.\\n\\nBy 2025, we want SAP to be the industry standard for maximizing customer lifetime value by delivering exceptional experiences, tangible business outcomes, differentiated value propositions, and a vibrant ecosystem.
