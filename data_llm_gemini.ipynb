The emergent discipline of explainable AI (XAI) has made great strides in helping people understand discriminative models. Less attention has been paid to generative models that produce artifacts, rather than decisions, as output. Meanwhile, generative AI (GenAI) technologies are maturing and being applied to application domains such as software engineering. Using scenario-based design and question-driven XAI design approaches, we explore users’ explainability needs for GenAI in three software engineering use cases: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. We conducted 9 workshops with 43 software engineers in which real examples from state-of-the-art generative AI models were used to elicit users’ explainability needs. Drawing from prior work, we also propose 4 types of XAI features for GenAI for code and gathered additional design ideas from participants. Our work explores explainability needs for GenAI for code and demonstrates how human-centered approaches can drive the technical development of XAI in novel domains.\\n\\n# KEYWORDS\\n\\ngenerative AI, software engineering tooling, explainable AI, human-centered AI, scenario based design\\n\\n# CCS CONCEPTS\\n\\n- Computing methodologies → Natural language generation;\\n- Software and its engineering;\\n- Human-centered computing → Human computer interaction (HCI); User studies;\\n\\n∗Work done during the first author’s internship at IBM Research AI.\\n\\n†Work done while the second author was at IBM Research AI.\\n\\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 License.\\n\\nIUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n© 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\\n\\nACM ISBN 978-1-4503-9144-3/22/03.\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3490099.3511119\\n\\n# ACM Reference Format:\\n\\nJiao Sun, Q.

In contrast to discriminative ML algorithms, which learn decision boundaries, GenAI models produce artifacts as output, which can have a wide range of variety and complexity. One major recent development of GenAI is the introduction of OpenAI’s GPT-3 [13] model, which can generate human-like language output and has striking versatility. Other generative language models have emerged that focus on specific domains such as software engineering, implementing use cases of auto-completing code [15, 39], translating code from one programming language to another [88], and converting natural language to code [23]. The industry has begun to use these models to support software engineering practices, with the most prominent example being GitHub CoPilot [27], a GenAI-based co-programming tool.\\n\\nAs a novel technology applied to novel domains, there are many open questions to be answered for how to make GenAI more capable and user-friendly. One open question is how to enable explainability—allowing users to understand and have a better mental model—of GenAI. Recent works by Goodfellow et al. [28] and Ross et al. [86] have explored developing more interpretable GenAI models that follow more human-understandable processes. However, a more comprehensive view of explainability for GenAI is lacking: what do users need to understand about a GenAI model in order to', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='b6951244-304c-42fa-9d39-788d52657272', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n# Jiao Sun et al.\\n\\neffectively achieve their goals when working with it? In this paper, we build a foundational understanding of explainability needs for GenAI in the context of generative code models. This question of what do users need to understand about AI systems is core to the nascent field of Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) [21, 22, 52], which is a subset of the fields of human centered AI and human centered data science [6, 7, 25, 41, 65–67]. Our work is informed by a few key lessons from recent work in HCXAI, mostly conducted in the context of discriminative ML (e.g., for decision-support systems). First, explainability needs should be considered broadly as any means of helping users achieve a better understanding of the AI system. Liao et al. [48] proposed to define user’s explainability needs by what questions they ask to understand the AI [48] and developed a framework of common questions. This framework demonstrates that users are interested in a broad range of explanatory information about an AI model, including its overall logic, how it reasons to produce a particular output, the training data, and its performance and range of output. However, user needs regarding generative models were not explored in that work.\\n\\nSecond, XAI solutions that address explainability needs should not be limited to algorithmic explanations or showing model internals. Depending on user needs, it may be more critical to provide transparent information about a model’s capabilities, limitations (e.g. uncertainty [10]) or provenance [8]. Moreover, users may need additional information beyond algorithmic explanations to fill in gaps of understanding. For example, Ehsan et al. [19] proposed that social transparency – making visible the socio-organizational factors that govern the use of AI – can help users form a socially-situated understanding of an AI system and take more effective actions with it.\\n\\nFinally, perhaps the most important lesson from HCXAI is that users’ explainability needs emerge in a usage context, guided by their goals and shaped by their backgrounds, expectations, as well as socio, organizational and cultural contexts [20, 48, 52]. It is thus necessary to follow a user-centered approach to understand explainability needs by involving target users and leveraging HCI methods that allow inquiry within the context of usage.\\n\\nBased on these lessons, we adopted a scenario-based design method by constructing realistic usage scenarios for three use cases of GenAI for code: code translation, code auto-completion, and natural language to code. We invited 43 software engineers to participate in 9 workshops to elicit their explainability needs and design ideas around these scenarios. We adapted the question-driven method of Liao et al. [48, 50] to elicit and comprehensively explore participants’ explainability needs by what kind questions they would ask in the scenarios. We also gathered feedback and design ideas from participants for four kinds of XAI features that we propose for the uses cases of GenAI for code. Our work makes three main contributions to the IUI community:\\n\\n1. We identify 11 categories of explainability needs in the context of Generative AI (GenAI) for code, for which we provide definitions and examples. We further contrast these categories with previous XAI techniques for discriminative ML and discuss explainability needs unique to GenAI and code generation use cases. We believe we are among the first to explore users’ explainability needs in an application domain of GenAI.\\n2. We propose four kinds of XAI features to support users of GenAI for code, based on prior work and adapted to the domain of code generation. These features are: AI documentation, indications of model uncertainty, visualizations of model attention, and social transparency. Based on participants’ responses, we provide concrete design recommendations to operationalize these features.\\n3. Our work makes methodological contributions by combining scenario-based design, participatory design workshops, and a question-driven approach to elicit explainability needs. We also reflect on the values and limitations of this method to inform future work that explores GenAI in new domains.\\n\\n# 2 RELATED WORK\\n\\nWe review three areas of related work that shaped our study: GenAI for code, explainable AI, and human-centered approaches to AI.\\n\\n# 2.1 Generative AI for Code\\n\\nThe application of modern NLP techniques to programming language can be traced back to the naturalness hypothesis [4, 17, 37], that software is a form of human communication. This hypothesis opened the door for applying NLP techniques previously used on human natural languages to source code, and recent work in this space is summarized by Talamadupula [92] and Allamanis et al. [4]. One example is how existing work on automatic, machine translation between human natural languages [71, 72] was applied to code. Specifically, the TransCoder [88] system applied neural machine translation techniques to translate source code across different languages. Other GenAI models have been developed that implement other use cases, such as generating documentation for code [23], auto-completing code [15, 39], generating unit tests [93], and finding duplicate code [30]. Models trained on massive code data sets are even able to handle multiple use cases at the same time, such as PLBART [3], CodeBERT [23], GraphCodeBERT [30]. Most recently, OpenAI released Codex [15], which is a GPT-based model trained on code from GitHub and powers their CoPilot [27] product. This model is capable of auto-completing code for various programming languages (e.g., Python, TypeScript, Go, Ruby), as well as generating code from natural language. The release of Copilot is seen as a revolution of AI-assisted software programming and has attracted much attention since its release [63]. Despite the fact that GenAI for code models still have room for improvement in the quality of their outputs – e.g., TransCoder only produces a correct translation 30%-70% of the time depending on the source and target language [88] – recent work by Weisz et al. [100] suggests that software engineers may nonetheless be tolerant of using such models in their work. Given the emerging productization of GenAI for code models, we believe it is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of questions software engineers will have when working with such models to guide technical XAI work and design solutions to answer them.\\n\\n# 2.2 Explainable AI\\n\\nExplainable AI (XAI) has spurred great academic, industry, and public interests in the past few years, thanks to the popularity of inscrutable “opaque-box” ML models. Many XAI techniques have', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='eb5357a8-0c80-4541-9f9b-48cf96a6e9f6', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design\\n\\n# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\nbeen developed for discriminative ML models, both through pro-\\n\\nducing directly interpretable models [14, 44] and generating post-\\n\\nhoc explanations for a trained opaque-box model [47, 62, 80, 104]. These explanations take a variety of forms. For example, global explanations provide an overview of the model logic, while local ex-\\n\\nplanations elucidate the rationale behind a particular output. A full review of XAI techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and can\\n\\nbe found in many recent survey papers [1, 29, 55, 56]. Our work is most closely informed by, and intends to bridge, the emerging topic of explainability for generative models, and the inter-disciplinary field of Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) [21, 22, 52].\\n\\nCompared to discriminative models, much less attention has been paid to developing XAI techniques for generative AI models. Some explored ways to make generative models more directly in-\\n\\nterpretable, which is often framed as making the representation learning of a GenAI model in its latent dimensions semantically meaningful so people can directly examine the model internals [28]. For example, disentanglement is a technique that seeks map-\\n\\npings between high-dimensional inputs and low-dimensional rep-\\n\\nresentations such that representation dimensions correspond to the ground-truth factors that generated the data [83]. Accordingly, some proposed disentanglement measures [16, 84] as a way to evaluate a GenAI model’s interpretability. A recent study by Ross et al. [86] proposed a user evaluation task to evaluate the human interpretability of generative models, by the ability for people to interactively modify representations to reconstruct target instances.\\n\\nOthers explored visualization approaches to present the repre-\\n\\nsentations to help users (often model developers) make sense of what the GenAI model has learned. For example, Ross et al. [86] use sliders to let users dynamically modify representation dimensions and see how corresponding instances change. Recent HCI works also explored the approach of “explainability through interaction\" for generative models, by allowing users to interact with the input or guiding output generation process [59, 60, 86, 103]. Through observing immediate feedback from changes to the model output, people can make better sense of how a generative model works. For example, Zhang and Banovic developed a system that allows users to interactively explore the output space of an image generative model to assess the model quality [103].\\n\\nThese varied approaches suggest that explainability is still a less than well-defined notion for GenAI. Here we adopt a HCXAI posi-\\n\\ntion that explainability, or the effectiveness of explanation, should be defined as enabling people’s understanding of the AI to achieve their goals [52]. With this human-centered definition, many have ar-\\n\\ngued that it is necessary to provide transparent information beyond the model internals, such as its performance, limitations, training data, and development procedure, to enable a holistic understanding of the AI and more actionable insights [11, 48, 73, 94]. As discussed, Liao et al. proposed to identify users’ explainability needs by elic-\\n\\niting the questions they ask to understand the AI [48, 50]. This method allows approaching XAI from the users’ perspective and thoroughly identify transparent information they need to achieve\\n\\nan understanding necessary for their goals, which, in the context of GenAI for code, could be about optimizing for the usage of the AI system and overall productivity. Liao et al.’s work was based on prior HCI work that defines “intelligibility types\" of information for context-aware intelligent systems by prototypical questions such\\n\\nas Input, Output, Why, What-if, etc. [53, 54]. It also draws on social science literature showing that people’s explanatory goals can be expressed in different kinds of questions [34]. We build on this line of work and adapt the question-drive method to elicit users’ explainability needs for GenAI for code.\\n\\n# 2.3 Human-centered approaches to AI\\n\\nThe term Human-centered AI has emerged in many academic works and public discussions [22, 25, 45, 65, 85, 89]. While definitions vary, human-centered approaches to AI aim to develop AI systems that serve the needs, improve the conditions, and align with the val-\\n\\nues of human stakeholders. Research begins to develop practical methods that can help achieve these goals. One set of methods gained much attention lately under the umbrella term of “partic-\\n\\nipatory machine learning” [32, 46, 97]. Built on the tradition of participatory design, participatory machine learning emphasizes involving stakeholders, especially affected marginalized groups, into the development process early on to shape the overall goals and design choices of ML systems. Some suggested that abstracting user values from their participatory input is especially effective to guide ML modeling choices such as defining its optimization functions, features, constraints, and so on [49, 68, 105]. This notion of driving technical development based on insights from empirical user studies is also at the core of broad IUI research [5].\\n\\nOne challenge to involving users to shape the design and techni-\\n\\ncal development of AI systems is that these systems often do not exist yet for people to experience and provide realistic feedback. This challenge can be tackled by human-centered methods that allow “envisioning future use possibilities”. One effective method is scenario-based design (SBD) [87]. SBD suspends the needs to define system operations by using narrative descriptions of how a user uses a system to accomplish a task, allowing people to respond to concrete interactions. We chose to use SBD to explore GenAI for code use cases as most software engineers do not have experience with such technologies. SBD also allows us to explore XAI design without the constraint of current technical feasibility, as adopted by several prior XAI works [19, 102].\\n\\n# 3 METHODOLOGY: SCENARIO-BASED DESIGN WORKSHOPS\\n\\nWe conducted 9 semi-structured workshops, with 3-6 participants in each, which lasted for 60-70 minutes. Due to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, participants joined the workshop remotely via a video conferencing tool. We also used Mural1, which provides visual workspaces for virtual collaboration. Each workshop was based on one of three use cases of GenAI for code: code translation, code autocompletion, and natural language to code. In the following, we first introduce the three use cases then describe the workshop in detail, then participants and analysis.\\n\\n# 3.1 Use Cases and Scenarios\\n\\nWe focus on three specific use cases of GenAI for code, based on the preferred choices that could deliver high value for software\\n\\n1https://www.mural.co/', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='9c5f3841-a49c-4fe6-9cb2-4fe368f9b104', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n# Jiao Sun et al.\\n\\nengineering tasks from a pre-study survey with 81 people who responded to our study recruitment message.\\n\\n- Code translation, in which a generative model translates source code from one language (e.g., Java) to another (e.g., Python). This task has been an important benchmark for technical work in GenAI for code [61] and has gained extensive attention from both industry and academia [3, 23, 30, 88, 99]. Such technologies can significantly reduce the cost and expertise barriers for code modernization work, in which a legacy codebase is ported to a modern programming language.\\n- Code autocompletion, in which a generative model takes comments and source code as input (e.g. a function specification and/or signature), and produces code as output (e.g. the implementation of the function). This use case can fulfill pervasive needs of software engineers to improve their productivity and efficiency. Notably, autocompletion is one of the primary functions of GitHub Copilot.\\n- Natural language to code, in which a generative model takes natural language (e.g. “change the color of the button to blue”) and produces code as output (e.g. button.setColor(Color.blue)). This use case is another function offered by GitHub Copilot and represents a promising way to reduce entry barriers to programming.\\n\\nFor each use case, we created a persona, Alex, who is a software engineer working in a team. In the scenario given to participants, Alex and his teammates are introduced to an AI system to support their work. They are told that they could ask for more information and new functions added to the AI system to help them understand and work better with the AI. Figure 1 (b) shows the description of the persona for the code auto-completion use case. A concrete scenario of a programming task that Alex would perform is shown in Figure 1 (c), and we show the programming tasks of the other two use cases (i.e., code translation and code autocompletion) in Appendix A.\\n\\nTo give participants a realistic experience, all AI-produced code in our scenarios was generated using state-of-the-art generative code models. We used TransCoder [88] for the code translation use case and Copilot [27] for the other two use cases. For the code translation use case, we selected a programming solution to the problem of converting integers to their Roman numeral representations.2 One reason we selected this code example is that there was a subtle bug in the translation generated by TransCoder [88]. This bug was pointed out by the workshop facilitator when introducing the scenario, to allow us to probe on participants’ reactions to the limitations of the AI. For the code autocompletion and natural language to code use cases, we selected a programming solution to the problem of counting the number of prime numbers from a given input. We sampled this problem from Project CodeNet [77], a large dataset of code samples. Based on CodeNet’s metadata, the acceptance rate of Python solutions for this problem is lower than 50%, indicating that it is a non-trivial coding problem for which GenAI models might provide assistance.\\n\\n2We selected a Java implementation of this problem from https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com.\\n\\n# 3.2 Workshop Format and Procedure\\n\\nIn each workshop, the facilitator first stated the purpose of the workshop, introduced concepts about generative AI for code, and asked for participants’ verbal consent and permission to record. Then, the facilitator started the recording and introduced the Alex persona and one of the programming problem scenarios described above. The main part of the workshop was carried out in two stages: first, an open-ended question elicitation exercise to understand participants’ explainability needs in the given scenario; and second, an ideation session in which 4 types of XAI features were used as design probes to elicit feedback and design ideas, to be described below. The content of the persona, scenario, and design probes were customized based on which use case was selected for the workshop. All discussions and screen activities were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, together with the content on the Mural pages.\\n\\n# 3.2.1 Stage 1: Question elicitation exercise\\n\\nThe first stage of the workshop was designed to elicit what kinds of questions participants would have for understanding the GenAI in the given scenario, based on the question-driven approach to XAI design proposed by Liao et al. [48, 50]. After describing Alex’s persona and the task scenario, the workshop facilitator asked participants: “Put yourself in Alex’s shoes, what does Alex want to know? What questions does Alex want to ask about the natural language to code model/AI?” Participants were given several minutes to come up as many questions they could, posted as sticky notes on the Mural page. Next, the facilitator worked with participants to collaboratively cluster similar questions together. Participants were asked to speak out loud as they moved around the sticky notes to describe their thought process and rationale. This process encouraged participants to read each other’s questions, ask for clarifications, and have discussions. After the clustering, the facilitator chose one sticky note in each cluster to represent the cluster, then invited participants to cast up to 3 votes for questions they considered to be the most important to address. After the voting session, participants were asked to share their rationales behind the votes to exchange ideas and stimulate new ideas.\\n\\n# 3.2.2 Stage 2: Ideation on XAI features\\n\\nIn addition to exploring general explainability needs, our study also aims to explore a few areas to develop XAI features that can address these needs. Given the novelty in both the technical XAI approaches for GenAI and the application domain, we adapted existing ideas from XAI solutions for discriminative ML models as a starting point of our discussions. Liao et al. [50] provides a suggested mapping between prototypical user questions (e.g., why, performance, data, output) and XAI methods or features that can answer the questions, primarily in the context of discriminative AI for decision-support systems. We built upon this work, as well as other work that explores XAI or transparency features [10, 21, 31], to select and adapt features that could apply to the context of GenAI for code. We also took into consideration their technical feasibility and potential values they can provide for the use cases. Through this process, we arrived at the following XAI features:\\n\\n- AI documentation is embodied by the recently-proposed concepts of FactSheets [8, 81], Model Cards [98], and About ML pages [78].

Prior work has shown how to use attention weights to visually depict which words in an input sequence, plus which words in previously-generated output, were responsible for a given token’s output [ 95 , 96 ]. In our design probe (Figure 2 (c)), we show the user querying a portion of output (in red) and seeing which tokens were responsible for that output (in yellow, where opacity is used to signal the strength of the attention weight). The opacities in the figure are based on the actual cross-attention weights from the model we used to generate the output.\\n\\n• Social transparency makes transparent the social contexts around the usage of an AI system to help people better understand the AI and how to utilize it. This feature was inspired by a recent work by Ehsan and Riedl [21], which examined the impact of making other users’ past interactions with a decision-support AI system transparent. To explore social transparency in our context, we created an open-ended probe to invite ideation by visually emphasizing the fact that Alex is not working alone, but works within a group of other software engineers (Figure 2 (d)).\\n\\n# 3.3 Participants\\n\\n# Recruitment.\\n\\nWe advertised our study within a large international information technology company, by distributing a survey targeted at software engineers working across many product lines and locations. 81 people responded. In the recruiting survey, we asked questions about their demographic information, self-evaluation of programming skills and previous experience of working with AI. In addition, we asked them to rate their interest in the 6 candidate user cases of generative AI models for code (in addition to the 3 selected use cases we included test case generation, documentation generation and code repair).\\n\\n# Selection Criteria.\\n\\nFor code autocompletion and natural language to code use cases, we required participants to have 1+ year of Python programming experience. For the code translation use case, we required participants to have 1+ year of both Python and Java programming experience. Among all sign-up responses, 56 (69%) had at least 1+ year of Python programming experience. From this set, we prioritized to select those who have had experience with AI systems, and we further narrowed down to 43 participants based on their time availability.\\n\\n# Demographics.\\n\\nFor the geographical location, the majority of our participants were from the United States (N=22; 65%) and India', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ac981ffa-4db0-49cb-ab28-3e39ca5d972b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design\\n\\n# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n|ID|Use Case|Participants|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|1|Code Translation (CT)|Software Engineer (P16, P20), Researcher/Scientist (P5, P52)|\\n|2|Code Translation (CT)|Software Engineer (P3, P62), Hardware Verification Engineer (P54), Data Scientist (P54), Researcher/Scientist (P25)|\\n|3|Code Autocompletion (CA)|Software Engineer (P2, P53, P63), Data Engineer (P64), Researcher/Scientist (P66)|\\n|4|Code Autocompletion (CA)|Software Engineer (P17, P39), Researcher/Scientist (P37, P55), Bioinformatician (P48), Data Scientist (P61)|\\n|5|Code Translation (CT)|Researcher/Scientist (P19), Software Engineer (P46), Software Architect (P14, P45, P75), Data Scientist (P78)|\\n|6|Natural language to code (NL2Code)|Software Engineer (P44), Researcher/Scientist (P71), Data Scientist (P80, P81)|\\n|7|Natural language to code (NL2Code)|Software Engineer (P59, P15), Software Architect (P41, P42), Researcher/Scientist (P13), Data Scientist (P30)|\\n|8|Natural language to code (NL2Code)|Software Engineer (P7, P22), Data Scientist (P8, P32)|\\n|9|Code Autocompletion (CA)|Software Engineer (P57, P72), Data Engineer (P33)|\\n\\nTable 1: Participants and their roles in our 9 brainstorming workshops about co-designing generative AI models for Code.

We then assigned participants to 9 workshops (3 for each use case) as shown in Table 1, where we mark participants who do not have experience working with AI in blue. Their coding independently with the agreed codes. As a result, they reached a high level of agreement on 66 out of 71 messages (93%). After another iteration of discussion to finalize the coding schema, one of the two researchers coded the rest of questions. We discuss findings from this analysis in Section 4.\\n\\nFor the rest of the workshops, we coded participants’ feedback and design ideas with regard to the four design probes. Our goal is to further understand users’ explainability needs in the context of generative AI, as well as to inform concrete XAI designs that can address these needs. This part of coding was conducted by one researcher with frequent discussions with the other researchers. We discuss these findings in Section 5.\\n\\n# 3.4 Analysis\\n\\nWe conducted content analysis on the written content in Mural, and around 600 minutes of interviews were recorded and transcribed. In total, we extracted 487 messages from Mural and 249 paragraphs from the video transcript relevant to explainability. We followed the workshop structure, and coded the data in five parts: question elicitation exercise, discussions around AI documentation, uncertainty indicator, attention visualiser and social transparency.\\n\\nTo analyze the questions collected from the question elicitation exercise, we referred to prior work using prototypical questions to represent explainability needs by Liao et al. [48] in the context of discriminative ML systems, and “intelligibility types” [53, 54] for context-aware intelligent systems by Lim and Dey, and used these existing definitions to guide our coding. We also paid attention to new types of questions that were not covered in these prior works. Two researchers first independently coded 106 questions collected, and discussed their codes to reach a consensus. Then, they updated.\\n\\n# 4 EXPLANABILITY NEEDS FOR GENAI FOR CODE\\n\\nThis section presents the results from the question elicitation exercise to understand what types of explainability needs participants had for the GenAI for code use cases. As mentioned, we followed the definitions of prototypical user questions in XAI Question Bank by Liao et al. [48] and “intelligibility types” in Lim and Dey [53] to code the following categories: Input, Output, Performance, Data, How (global), Why/Why NOT, How to, What if, Control. We further identified two new categories that were not covered by the prior works: System Requirements and Impact, and Limitations. In Table 2, we present these question categories, with their definitions, and example questions asked by participants. They are ordered by the frequency of being asked by participants. Categories unique to the GenAI for code are marked with a dagger (†) sign. Categories that appeared in Lim and Dey [53] but not Liao et al. [48] are marked with an asterisk (∗) sign.

We applied the definitions of prototypical user questions in XAI Question Bank by Liao et al. [48] (in the context of discriminative ML, mainly for decision-support) and “intelligibility types” in Lim and Dey [53] (for context-aware intelligent systems). Categories marked with a asterisk (*) are categories only appeared in Lim and Dey [53] not Liao et al. [48]. Categories with dagger (†) represent new categories emerged in our GAI for code context. For each question category, we provide the definition we used for coding and a few example questions asked by participants.\\n\\n219', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='dcf65900-3171-4339-8f59-b919269d9a8e', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design\\n\\n# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n# Question Category and What We Can Learn About Users’ Explainability Needs with GenAI for Code\\n\\n# Input\\n\\nTo understand what kind of inputs the model can take or should be given was the most prominent explainability needs of participants, making up about 16% of all questions. On one hand, participants wanted to have an overview of the types or scope of inputs the AI can work with. Some asked about the AI’s ability to process types of programming languages, data types, algorithms, language versions, and so on. On the other hand, participants were eager to know how to optimize their inputs to produce better outputs. For example, participants in W4-CA raised the question “Should Alex write smaller functions that are easier to name or extensive documentation for complex functions?” and “Can I describe the entire problem in a single well-written sentence? or will I always need to break down the problem into small natural language chunks” asked by W6-NL2Code. Participants’ questions reflected their current mental models on how the GenAI works to process inputs, which were not necessarily accurate, suggesting that explanations may need to start from a high-level overview of how GenAI works in a specific code generation use case. It is interesting to note that this category is not a prominent need for decision-support AI using discriminative ML, since the input is often fixed or implicit. In contrast, the great variability and close coupling between input and output for GenAI made it a primary explainability needs to address.\\n\\n# Output\\n\\nTo understand what output the GenAI can produce is another frequent explainability need. Participants were mainly interested in the characteristics of the output code, and the scope of the output or system functions. Understanding the characteristics of the output can help users determine how to utilize the output, for example P5 from W1-CT commented: “you cannot ask Python to be as efficient as Java, but at the same time, Python may be more convenient than Java in some specific situations...”. Understanding the characteristics can also guide users to assess the quality of output, identify potential shortcomings or errors for further actions, as commented by P19 from W4-CA: “if it’s translating from a language like RUST that doesn’t allow overflow, it’s not possible into a language like Java allows it.”. Meanwhile, some participants asked about the scope of the output, as to discover what the GenAI can do, such as whether it can generate test cases or multiple candidates as alternatives.\\n\\n# How (Global)\\n\\nParticipants also recognized the importance of having a global understanding of the GenAI. Many wanted to have a high-level understanding of how the codes are generated, such as “how exactly does it generate code? is it pulling from sites or using GANs to generate new code” from W3-CA and “how the model comprehends the user input” from W6-NL2Code. Some raised these questions based on their expectations of the input and output of the model (e.g., “Python is dynamically typed, Java is static, how do you enforce these typing rules?” from W1-CT. Others inquired about how the model deals with specific types of input, such as “How untagged text is used for analysis” from W9-CA. These questions reflected interests in both a high-level description of how code generation works, and examining detailed model logic. For descriptive ML, global explanations often take the forms of showing how the model weighs different features or describing the general rules the predictions follow. How to communicate such a global view of model logic for GenAI is an open technical challenge.\\n\\n# Performance\\n\\nMany participants were concerned about understanding the performance, i.e. how well the GenAI works for the use case. These questions are critical for users to develop appropriate trust and adopt the system. We found the questions are mainly concerned about the overall performance, the quality of a specific generated code and the run-time efficiency of the model (e.g., inference time of the model, if the AI supports multi-threading). It is interesting to note that “quality of code” may be multi-faceted as participants mentioned correctness, runtime complexity, space complexity, understandability, and testability. Many of these performance-related questions were asked to understand performance differences and limitations with regard to different types of input (e.g. larger code). The interest in run-time performance is a unique need emerged in the GenAI for code context.\\n\\n# How To\\n\\nThese questions inquired about how to change or improve the input to get a better output. Answers to these questions can help participants choose strategies to make better use of the AI, such as “How to [make] requirement better [to improve the output]”? from W9-CA and “How can I get the AI to write efficient code?” from W6-NL2Code.\\n\\n# Control\\n\\nThese questions were regarding options to customize or specify preferences for how the model should work. This category was not seen in Liao et al.’s work defining explainability needs for decision-support discriminative ML. Emergence of this type of question in our context suggests that users of GenAI for code are interested in having more control on the working of the model, as illustrated by P61 from W1-CT saying that “Oftentimes, you’re not using the tool for just basic examples. I guess more in depth, like, explanations of what you can do with the model would be appreciated.”\\n\\n# Why/Why Not (Local)\\n\\nDifferent from asking How (global) questions to understand the overall process or logic of the model, a Why (local) question was asked to understand a specific output from the model. More often than not, the Why question was triggered by a surprising or suspicious output, such as “Why did the AI think the code satisfied the requirement?” at W7-NL2Code or “How did the AI recognize the function from comments in this task?” at W4-CA. Sometimes the Why question was asked in contrast to the expected output, and hence a Why Not (the expected output) question, such as “Why didn’t my input work?” from W3-CA.\\n\\n# Data\\n\\nSome participants brought up questions regarding the training data, especially regarding the provenance of the data, such as “Where does the code the AI was trained on come from?” from W3-CA.

How to define alignment of training data in the context of GenAI, however, remains an open question.\\n\\n# System Requirement and Impact\\n\\nA new category emerged in our data that was not covered in prior works. This category is questions regarding requirements or impact of the system, which can help users gauge the appropriate conditions of usage. They were asked regarding the usage of the system instead of the underlying model. These questions were highly specific to the software engineer context, including compatible development environments, software and hardware requirements, dependencies, and so on.\\n\\n# Limitations\\n\\nAnother category unique in our data is questions explicitly asking about the limitations of the model or system, such as what kind of scenarios it cannot cover or limitations to the model’s functions. These questions emerged likely due to the complexity of the input and output spaces of GenAI, which is less straightforward to comprehend than a decision-support AI system.\\n\\n# What If\\n\\nSome asked about what the output would be given hypothetical changes to the input, which may further help participants understand how the AI makes decisions in a counterfactual manner, such as “what to return if the input is invalid?” from W5-CT.\\n\\nTo summarize, we identified 11 categories of explainability needs in GenAI for code use cases. Four of these categories did not appear in Liao et al. as prominent needs for discriminative ML used for decision-support: Input, Control, System Requirements & Impact and Limitations. The top five most frequent categories are Input, Output, How (global), Performance and How to. In Section 6, we will further discuss insights revealed about explainability needs that are unique to the GenAI technology and the novel use case of supporting code generation.\\n\\n# XAI Features for GenAI for Code\\n\\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, we proposed four types of XAI features for GenAI for code and created design probes to elicit ideation from participants: AI documentation, uncertainty indicator, attention visualizer, and social transparency. In this section we discuss participants’ response to derive concrete design recommendations.\\n\\n# AI Documentation\\n\\nAI documentation is advocated to increase the transparency and facilitate understanding of AI, and is embodied in recently proposed features of AI Factsheets and Model Cards. However, what documentation should include for generative AI models is under-investigated, let alone GenAI for code use cases. We are interested in what categories of information about the model should be presented in AI documentation for GenAI for code, and how they might differ from that of discriminative ML. We used a low-fidelity UI design of a factsheet with intentionally open-ended content, and asked participants to brainstorm AI documentation categories that could help the user in the design scenario.\\n\\nWe summarize the categories identified from data analysis in Table 3, ranked by the frequencies of mentions by participants. In particular, we identified categories that surfaced in the context of GenAI for code that were not discussed in previous works on AI FactSheets or Model Cards: Examples and tutorials, Software engineering capabilities, Output code quality and utility, Supported languages and frameworks, Control and Deployment Requirement & Platform.\\n\\nConsistent with findings from the question elicitation exercise, participants expressed strong interests in understanding the scopes of inputs and outputs of the system. Examples and tutorials, as the most frequently mentioned category, suggests that example-based explanations can be a fruitful area to explore for GenAI to help users understand the model inputs and outputs. Such interests are also expressed as requirements specific for software engineering tasks, including Software engineering capabilities and Supported languages and frameworks. Participants also wished to see information about performance, data, control, system deployment requirement, and global model explanations, suggesting that providing documentation could help address corresponding explainability needs.\\n\\nAnother interesting pattern is that participants requested categories of information regarding the generated code artefacts rather than the model itself. Many demanded to see metrics about the code quality and utility, which should be differentiated from model performance metrics such as accuracy. While the latter are commonly calculated with some ground-truth in a held-out test dataset, the former are concerned with characterizing the generated code and their utility for improving human productivity.\\n\\nIn general, documentation for GenAI for code should be transparent about the quality of the produced code from the software engineering perspective, and align with the professional culture and standards, such as communicating the license and regulatory requirements in both the training data acquisition and the usage of the produced code. Table 3 is not meant to serve as an exhaustive template for AI documentation of generative AI models for code. Instead, we hope that these discovered categories can inspire what to document for generative AI models for code.\\n\\n# Model Uncertainty\\n\\nInspired by previous work on model uncertainty of generative AI models for code and communicating uncertainty of output for discriminative ML models, we created the design probe to communicate uncertainty for a line of AI generated code, indicated by a wavy underline. We asked participants to react to the feature and discuss how to improve the feature, including follow-up interactions, to better support users’ understanding and their usage of the AI system.\\n\\nTheir suggested improvement and follow-up interactions can be categorized as AI initiated and human initiated. For the AI to take the initiative, participants suggested to see more information from the model to help them understand the output and edit if necessary, for example to include suggesting alternative outputs, providing uncertainty explanations, and giving more fine-grained uncertainty.\\n\\n# Alternative Outputs\\n\\nParticipants wanted transparency about what other alternatives the AI model had considered as output.

Categories are sorted in descending order, based on the frequency of mention by participants. Categories marked with a † or ∗ have not been identified by previous works in AI documentation. We postulate that categories marked with a dagger (†) emerged due to the context of generative models, and categories marked with an asterisk (∗) emerged due to the context of software engineering support.\\n\\ngain insights from more options, as P63 from W3-CA stated that “I voted for the multiple [version] candidates, which I think is just generally helpful. Even if the top generated candidate was not quite right maybe one of the top five will be. Or will be better for whatever the particular use cases.”. Some participants hoped to see alternatives with specific characteristics (e.g., better readability or optimization), as P80 from W6-NL2Code stated: “Obviously if human knows about the time complexity and the optimization of the code, he can fetch a better one. And at present, we do not know whether [the] AI [is] trying to be more on the readable side or more on the optimization side.”\\n\\n# Uncertainty explanation.\\n\\nParticipants desired to see uncertainty explanation from the model, on why a particular part of the code was highlighted or why the AI was uncertain. This is an under-explored area in XAI. Participants suggested that the sources for uncertainty explanations could be what alternative options the model was struggling with (W8-NL2Code), or what goal or rationale the model follows (W6-NL2Code). We quote P71 from W6-NL2Code who proposed an interactive explanation to address this point:\\n\\n“I’ve voted twice for an indication of what the model is trying to achieve, because I think that’s very important. It could be very simple. It could be as simple as just reminding you exactly what natural language prompt this was derived from, so you can think to yourself: ‘what was it trying to do?’ Uh, based on what I wrote, cause I know what I wrote, and I know what that means and then I can rewrite it from there or it could be more complex.

The corresponding parts could be from input, previously generated lines, or training data.\\n\\n# Fine-grained uncertainty\\n\\nSome participants wanted to see more than just a wavy line under outputs that are below an uncertainty threshold. For example, P71 from W6-NL2Code said: “...if there is some confidence percentage that could be helpful to, you know, like Green Zone, Red zone and Yellow zone etc., to give an idea of the highest priority I need to fix this.” Related to the observation that code quality is multi-faceted, some participants wanted to understand the specific definition or aspect of uncertainty, such as whether it is regarding the correctness, time complexity, or runtime.\\n\\nAnother area of suggested interactions requires the human to take the initiative, including allowing human input to resolve uncertainty and supporting interactive testing for the uncertain regions, as discussed below.\\n\\n# Human input to resolve uncertainty\\n\\nA frequently requested interaction was that the AI waits for human input to resolve uncertainty. This could be realized by the AI prompting the human with a variety of questions, including confirmation (W3-CA), clarification (e.g., “show did you mean ... options” from W1-CT), inspection (e.g., “Tell user to examine the line carefully and verify” from W4-CA), preferences or how they would code (e.g., “Ask user for decision making – ‘do you want to keep this line or not’ and highlight it with reasoning” from W5-CT), and immediate modification (e.g., “Dialog box to type preferred translation (if Alex knows python)” from W2-CT).\\n\\n# Interactive testing\\n\\nAnother interaction that participants expected to perform is interactive testing for situations in which the model was uncertain, which can also facilitate understanding of the AI model. P81 from W6-NL2Code said that “... If we can probably give a similar interactive component [as Jupyter Notebook] where it gives you the option to fetch a context from the previous clients, and then run only that piece of code to see what the output is. Probably the person can make a better decision on whether to keep it or change.”\\n\\nThe overall feedback from participants was that showing a line-level uncertainty indicator would be useful to guide users’ attention to potentially low-quality code. However, showing uncertainty alone was not enough to satisfy their explainability needs. Many of the suggested interactions also serve the purpose of helping users better understand the model behaviors through interactive testing, alternative output it considered, and explaining the uncertainty. Through these interactions, users can develop a more appropriate mental model of the system that can help them interact more effectively in the long run.\\n\\n# Attention Distribution\\n\\nAttention distribution is a popular approach to explain an individual prediction made by a neural networks model, by the relative importance of parts of input to determine the output [95, 96]. Mapping to the context of GenAI for code, we designed the UI in Figure 2c, where the user can select a span of generated content. The AI can then highlight some spans in the previous content, to illustrate the idea of attention when making local decisions, indicating different attention weights via different opacity. We showed it to participants to gather their response on the utility of attention distribution visualizer for users of GenAI for code.\\n\\nIn general, participants said that the attention features would be useful to help them understand how the model worked, and to guide them in modifying the input to produce better results. P42 from W7-NL2Code said that “It’s what trains me as the user to use the AI better” and P63 from W3-CA said that “if you see an issue, you might be able to say, oh, I can go back and try tweaking this part of the input and see whether I can get a better result. So that could be useful.”\\n\\nParticipants also proposed potential ways to improve this local explanation feature. For example: 1) line-level interpretation might be more appropriate than the span level, as P53 in W3-CA said: “selecting a span may not be the best option for a user interface; potentially a line is better”; 2) being able to make immediate changes “right after identifying the suspicious spots” via such a tool (P55 in W4-CA); 3) syntax tree driven selection so that “if you click on the range, you should get the whole function not only the span” (P63 in W3-CA); 4) adding natural language explanation in addition to the color coding (P71 in W6-NL2Code and P22 in W8-NL2Code).\\n\\nMoreover, participants saw value in utilizing user edits or interaction with attention distribution as signals to improve the model or future interactions, for example, collecting the user edits, as P63 in W3-CA said that “it might be more useful for how do we improve the model? Cause if somebody... starts typing in, here’s the code that I really wanted here. And you can see how does that align and say, wait, why isn’t this aligning? It might be more useful is user feedback back to the model builders.”\\n\\n# Social Transparency\\n\\nSocial transparency (ST) in AI system is recently proposed by Ehsan et al. [19], built on the concept of social transparency in social computing [90]. ST makes visible socio-organizational factors that influence the use of AI by presenting other users’ interactions with the AI, aiming to facilitate a better understanding of and effective actions with AI output. To explore ST in the context of GenAI for code, we introduced an open-ended probe in Figure 2d: an image highlighting that Alex was not working alone but together with a team of software engineers, all using the GenAI. We asked participants to ideate on what users might want to know about other team members’ interactions with the AI to help them better understand and use the AI. We asked participants to write down their ideas in Mural, and then did the clustering, voting and sharing again. We collected 111 responses about ST from Mural, grouped them to categories, and sorted them based on the frequencies of their occurrences. With the open-ended probe, we were able to elicit user needs for ST in the broad context of software engineer work with the participation of GenAI for code. We therefore map the findings to a stage model of the software development life cycle based on Rani [79]: 1) Requirement Analysis; 2) Design; 3) Implementation; 4) Testing; 5) Deployment and Maintenance [79].', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='1464963a-55f8-482d-988b-e8f7ca277ae8', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design\\n\\nIUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\nAt the stage of requirement analysis, participants wanted to know about the team information of who, and for what, will be using the AI, such as business requirements and goals of the team, information about each team member (e.g., programming skills and experience), their interaction patterns with the AI (e.g., who is frequently using AI and who is better at using AI) and the reason why they are using the AI. Knowing the team information early on could help users better coordinate and interpret ST information in later stages.\\n\\nInformation about other people’s experience with the AI could help at the design stage so that users could better design their programming tasks with the GenAI, including taking precautions on when and how they need to take more control on the code generation. It is especially helpful to learn about the AI’s performance, capability and limitations from others’ experience at this stage. For example, participants wanted to know how other people had evaluated the performance of the model and their judgement of the code quality, including how much time they invested in getting started with AI, how the AI-generated code compared to human-written code, together with the strengths and weaknesses of the AI. Moreover, they were interested in seeing limitations, such as common pitfalls and errors that other members had experienced.\\n\\nGoing into the development stage, participants wanted to have information about similar tasks or requests of other people to better understand what the AI model was capable of doing, even re-use the generated content, to help them better manage the programming tasks. Some participants expressed a desire to always have clarity on the authoring entity of code (whether from AI, a colleague, or other resources) throughout the development stage to better manage their expectations, actions as well as accountability.\\n\\nAt the testing stage, participants wished to know how other people had tested the AI model as a reference, including what measures they had used in their evaluation of code quality. Many requested to understand AI’s impact on humans at this stage, i.e. how the introduction of the AI influenced the productivity of the team members, such as team speed and productivity. They also wanted to know whether and how the AI-generated code might be added to the codebase.\\n\\nFinally, during the deployment and maintenance stage, participants asked for information about how to customize the model parameters and monitored metrics based on the preferences of the team, and how to collect the team’s edits and feedback to improve the model.\\n\\nThese results move beyond Ehsan et al. [19] ’s work that defined ST features at the point of AI decision-support. Our results open up the design space to embed rich ST features at different stages of software development. ST features in the context of GenAI for code can not only facilitate users to better understand and use the AI, but also potentially foster a more effective “human-AI assemblage\" where GenAI is introduced as a member or assistant of a software engineer team. We encourage future work to further explore the design space.\\n\\n# 6 DISCUSSION\\n\\n# 6.1 Informing XAI approaches for GenAI for code\\n\\nThe rich and complex inputs and outputs of GenAI, and the tight coupling of the two, make it a prominent need for users to form a clear mental model on the scope, characteristics, and limitations of the input and output spaces, as well as a global view of how the model generates outputs from inputs. The observation that participants’ explainability needs focused overwhelmingly on input, output and global explanations, suggests a mismatch between what users of GenAI applications need and the technical community’s current focus on explanations for representation learning and visualizing representations.\\n\\nThe explainability categories we identified have varied technical feasibility with current techniques, and point to topics that are under-explored for generative AI. For example, for the Performance category, existing works have used the Computational Accuracy metric to evaluate generative code models [9, 15, 33, 88], but not other metrics we uncovered regarding the characteristics of the generated artifacts and run-time efficiency. To understand performance differences and limitations with regard to different types of input, solutions have been explored for natural language generation under Prompt Engineering [57, 58]. Similar studies in the code space are limited to the number of few-shot examples in the prompt, and the effect of length of prompt on performance [9, 15]. A more detailed analysis of these phenomenon, better grounded in the semantics of programming languages, could be a promising area for future research. For the Control category, it is feasible to directly interact with model parameters. However, questions of how to elicit human feedback or edits and incorporate them to train generative models are currently under explored.\\n\\nXAI for GenAI needs to be contextualized by the characteristics of the generated artifacts, and the practical and cultural contexts to use these artifacts, i.e. the software engineering domain in our case. For example, participants were interested in understanding the input and output spaces with regard to supported language, frameworks, data structures, and so on. They are also interested in metrics reflecting various aspects of code characteristics and impact on human productivity rather than technical accuracy alone.\\n\\nParticipants’ questions reflected their desire for an actionable or utility-oriented understanding to support their end goal of optimizing code generation and programming productivity [18, 50, 52], such as asking the Input, Output, How and How-to XAI questions (described in Section 4) to facilitate strategies to get better outputs from the AI. This actionable understanding can also be supported by enabling follow-up actions towards their goals after seeing transparent information. For example, participants suggested many interactions to allow them to act on uncertainty information and improve the generated code.\\n\\nIn short, explainability needs should be understood and addressed with the ecological factors in mind, situated in an understanding of the behavioral and social contexts of the system [41, 70]. We paid attention to the nature of software engineer tasks and workflows as part of the pragmatic human environment of the system. For example, participants demanded information regarding system requirements and impacts in relation to their broader work.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='e98a6599-9af2-407c-9345-aac1bb79435b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n# Jiao Sun et al.\\n\\n# 6.2 Design implications for GenAI for code\\n\\nIn our study, we observed a positive user reception towards natural language explanations and interactions with the GenAI as user inputs are programming- or natural-language based. We envision that a conversational agent interface could be a natural fit for AI assistant for code or co-programming tools, as explored in recent work [42, 43].\\n\\nWe also noticed that the explainability needs and user needs in general may differ for users with varied levels of programming skills. Less experienced participants generally asked fewer questions in the workshop. It is possible that they face more challenges articulating or realizing they had certain explainability needs, and may benefit from more proactive explanations or an entire interaction session focusing on training and explaining rather than in-situ explanations. Future research should further explore user needs in GenAI for code use cases that target reducing programming barriers and enabling novices to code.\\n\\nLastly, the bulk of explainability needs around GenAI for code leads to the question of utility of GenAI for code itself. One concern stems from the assumption that users are burdened with understanding how the AI works and adjusting their inputs for optimal outcomes, as expressed by P7 in W8-NL2Code: “as you were talking about this in this session, I keep thinking, if you are learning about all the use cases and how you’re going to structure the natural language and everything, how is it kind of different than just learning an actual language?”. We also note that at the current time, generative code models are prone to errors and will require post-generation improvements from humans [69, 100]. There is a fundamental question on the readiness of the technology, which may not be able to be addressed by providing explainability alone. We urge the AI and HCI community to evaluate GenAI for code technologies, define intended use, and refrain from use cases that have not been validated or have risks of harmful consequences for stakeholders.\\n\\n# 6.3 Human-centered, participatory, and question-driven approaches to XAI design\\n\\nOur study used a scenario-based design [87] combined with a question-driven method to elicit explainability needs, based on work by Liao et al. [48, 50]. We reflect on a few strategies that worked well for our study, and encourage researchers and practitioners to adopt similar approaches to understand users’ explainability needs early-on to drive technical and design choices.\\n\\nFirst, we found the use of a scenario, persona and an illustrated prototype corresponding to the scenario to effectively aid the elicitation of rich user questions, even for a technology that was completely new for participants. As Liao et al. [50] suggested “for highly novel systems, scenarios or low-fi prototypes can be used to elicit questions”. Moreover, we incorporated real outputs from state-of-the-art generative code models in the low-fi prototype to illustrate the model capabilities, which was repeatedly inquired by participants to confirm the scenario has a realistic reflection of the GenAI capabilities. This approach also echoes a recent trend in AI design to utilize real data points as “data probes” to aid design ideation [91]. The choice of data point can sway the discussions in the user study. We suggest to choose ones that reflect the AI’s true capabilities, including limitations and errors to explore the design space more thoroughly.\\n\\nSecond, we found the procedure of “pooling-clustering-voting” questions to be productive. While Liao et al. [50]’s original method only deals with question elicitation in one-on-one interviews, we adopted a participatory workshop format to balance between individual brainstorming and group discussions. Giving participants seven minutes to post their questions allowed a quantity of questions to be added. Working collaboratively to cluster them and vote on the clusters encouraged discussions and building upon each other’s ideas. This procedure also allowed participants to naturally articulate reasons behind their questions for our data collection.\\n\\nLastly, in addition to the question elicitation exercise, we explored four types of XAI features with low-fi prototypes. We defined these features based on prior works in different technical and application domains. A critical study design decision we had to make is the open-endedness of these prototypes. For some features (uncertainty indicators and attention visualizers), there already exist relevant techniques, so we chose a more concrete design to elicit feedback and ideas for extension. For other features (documentation and ST), the design space is less defined so we used more open-ended probes to allow participants to freely and critically brainstorm. In short, the design of a “probe” for participatory ideation and feedback is a non-trivial design decision, requiring a balance between concreteness and openness, considerations of both technical feasibility and user value, and diligent pilot testing [12, 24].\\n\\n# 7 CONCLUSION\\n\\nDespite growing efforts to apply state-of-the-art GenAI models to support software engineering tasks, investigations on user needs for such technologies have been scarce. Our work is among the first to study users’ explainability needs of GenAI for code. By combining scenario-based design [87] and a recently proposed question-driven design method for XAI [48, 50], we conducted 9 participatory workshops with 43 software engineers to understand their explainability needs with three use cases of GenAI for code: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. As a result, we identified 11 categories of explainability needs in the context of GenAI for code. We provided detailed definitions and examples for these categories, and contrasted them with common explainability needs for discriminative ML discussed in prior work [48, 53]. In addition, we proposed four areas of XAI features for these use cases, collected feedback from participants and provided concrete design recommendations. We hope that our results can inspire future AI and HCI work that can enable better human-AI collaboration for software engineering, and encourage more human-centered approaches to drive AI technical development.\\n\\n225', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='5e0634f9-f18b-4d8a-9e41-e0474b0e0743', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design\\n\\n# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\\n\\n# REFERENCES\\n\\n1.

In view of this heterogeneity and increased relevance, we conduct a meta-analysis on 51 empirical-quantitative studies and include board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size as key board attributes. We find that board independence and gender diversity are positively linked with CSR reporting. Furthermore, we examine whether this relationship is moderated by country-specific governance aspects (shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law regime). We find that board independence and gender diversity are stronger related to CSR reporting in countries with a higher range of shareholder protection and higher legal enforcement strength. We do not find any evidence for a moderator effect of code law regimes. To analyze the sensitivity of our study, we differentiate between CSR reporting measures (individual disclosure scores versus external CSR disclosure ratings) and publication quality of our included papers (journals of the ABS ranking) and found robust results. Recommendations for future research practice and regulation will be discussed.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nBoard Composition, CSR Reporting, Board Diversity, Board Independence, CEO Duality, Board Size, Gender Diversity\\n\\n# 1. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting has been rapidly increasing by public interest entities (PIEs) since the financial crisis 2007-2008. In view of the heterogeneous use of the term “CSR”, we refer to the famous triple bottom line concept and the business case model, indicating that economic, environmental and social aspects are equal within sustainable and stakeholder-oriented management (Carroll, 1999). CSR reporting as a complement to traditional financial accounting (e.g. financial corporate governance variables and measures of CSR reporting) represents the main element of stakeholder management (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013). The main goal of CSR reports is to increase stakeholder trust in order to analyze CSR performance (Murphy & McGrath, 2013). On the one hand, the literature states that the quality of CSR reports has increased because of stakeholder awareness and pressure (Moneva et al., 2006). On the other hand, information overload and greenwashing behaviour have decreased stakeholders’ trust in CSR reporting (Mahoney et al., 2013; Ramus & Montiel, 2013).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='eec21857-a05d-44d1-a2f0-96e2affd0d21', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\\n\\ngovernance and the degree of CSR reporting. In our meta-analysis, we assume that CSR reporting may be mainly influenced by: 1) board independence, 2) absence of CEO duality, 3) gender diversity, and 4) board size. We identify those four items as the most common board composition variables in empirical sustainable corporate governance research. As moderating country-specific governance variables, we include the strength of shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law systems. Furthermore, for sensitivity analyses, we compare two CSR reporting measures (individual disclosure scores versus external CSR disclosure ratings) and analyze publication quality (a reference to the ABS journal ranking). Our meta-analysis presents that board independence and gender diversity are positively related to CSR reporting and those variables are more positively linked with CSR reporting in countries with a higher range of shareholder protection and higher legal enforcement. We do not find any evidence for a moderator effect of code law regimes. In our sensitivity analyses, we found robust results.\\n\\nWe see a major benefit of our meta-analysis in comparison to former narrative literature reviews on that topic (e.g. Dienes et al., 2016; Hahn & Kühnen, 2013; Jain & Jamali, 2016; Malik, 2015; Velte, 2017) and in comparison to meta-analyses on related corporate governance and CSR issues (e.g. Byron & Post, 2016 (gender diversity); Ortas et al., 2017 (board independence); Majumder et al., 2017 (corporate governance attributes)). Literature reviews only give a qualitative summary on prior empirical results without measuring the total impact of board composition on CSR reporting. Thus, meta-analyses on that topic are major complements to prior literature reviews. In contrast to other related meta-analyses, we focus on selected board composition variables on the one side and CSR reporting on the other side. As CSR reporting is one of the most common variables of analyzing CSR engagement, we decide to focus on this variable and not on other measures (e.g. donations, external CSR ratings without any link to CSR reporting). CSR reporting mainly relates to corporate governance aspects, e.g. the information on sustainable management compensation or (gender) diversity on the board of directors. As researchers, regulators and companies are more and more aware of possible relationships, there is little knowledge about the overall impact of those board composition variables on CSR reporting from an international perspective. Insofar, our meta-analysis contributes to the present literature as we analyze the overall impact of the most common board composition variables by 51 papers on board composition variables and CSR reporting.\\n\\nOur analysis is aimed at researchers, regulators, and practitioners alike. It provides starting points for future research activities in terms of investigating the link between board composition and CSR reporting variables. The findings also provide an important impetus for the analysis and development of recent sustainable corporate governance regulations. As already stated, board composition is currently regulated as an instrument in order to strengthen CSR reporting. Our meta-analysis will contribute to this regulatory discussion by showing the possible outcomes of these reforms. Finally, we would like to motivate corporate practice to recognize the interactions of board composition and CSR reporting activities as key elements of building stakeholder trust.\\n\\nThis paper is structured as follows. First, the research framework is presented from a theoretical and empirical perspective. In so doing, we first present the theoretical framework, followed by a review of the empirical literature on our board composition variables and CSR reporting and by an analysis of the moderating variables of our study (Section 2). In this context, we deduct the hypotheses of our meta-analysis. Then, the research method will be presented: criteria for inclusion, search strategy, primary study variables, moderators, and analysis strategy (Section 3). Furthermore, we present the results of our meta-analysis and the sensitivity analysis (Section 4). Finally, in our discussion, we stress the main recommendations for research, practice, and regulators (Section 5). The paper will close with our conclusions.\\n\\n# 2. THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION OF THE IMPACT OF BOARD COMPOSITION ON CSR REPORTING\\n\\n# 2.1. Theoretical framework\\n\\nBoard composition can have a positive or negative impact on CSR reporting. This assumption relies on theories based on economics (e.g. stakeholder-agency theory) that assume a positive relationship by tendency or on socio-political theories (e.g. legitimacy theory) that assume a negative connection. According to stakeholder-agency theory, CSR reporting should decrease information asymmetries and conflicts of interest between management and different stakeholder groups. Monitoring institutions such as the board of directors are an application of agency theory that enhances the decision usefulness of CSR reports. However, board directors can only fulfil the information needs of stakeholders if some requirements, e.g. board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and appropriate board size are realized. When stakeholders are satisfied with board composition and CSR reporting, a positive impact can be expected on corporate financial and CSR performance.\\n\\nIn contrast to stakeholder-agency theory, legitimacy theory stresses a negative relationship between board composition and CSR reporting. Organizations seek to comply with their society’s specific norms, values and boundaries by implementing innovative reporting tools, such as CSR reporting. This can enhance organizations’ image as good corporate citizens, as well as their competitive position. Legitimacy theory recognizes the risks that positive self-', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ad7f2f9e-f8ab-4638-8e8a-86b01d5b19e0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\\n\\n# 2.2. Board composition variables and CSR reporting\\n\\n# 2.2.1. Board independence\\n\\nStakeholder-agency theory stresses the importance of non-executive directors being independent of the executive directors. Board independence is a necessary condition for monitoring measures with the aim of CSR reporting that fulfils the stakeholders’ informational needs. Research has stated a positive influence of independent board members on reporting quality (Farber, 2005) as well as the quality of external audits (DeFond et al., 2005) and a reduced cost of capital (Anderson et al., 2003). Without adequate board independence, stakeholder-agency theory assumes higher management incentives to use “boilerplates” in the CSR reporting without precise information for the stakeholders or even use greenwashing strategy to manipulate the public. According to legitimacy theory, board independence can also be linked with those negative incentives of CSR reporting. This may be explained by a symbolic management strategy to appoint more independent board directors without reflection of stakeholders’ interests of CSR reporting.\\n\\nInsofar, it is not surprising, that the empirical results of board independence are mixed. Among others, Das et al. (2015), Khan (2010) and Htay et al. (2012) stated a positive relationship between board independence and CSR reporting. In contrast to this, Sundarasen et al. (2016), Haniffa and Cooke (2005) and Prado-Lorenzo et al. (2012) found a negative relationship. The heterogeneous theoretical and empirical research results lead to the following hypotheses:\\n\\n- H1a: Board independence is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory.\\n- H1b: Board independence is negatively linked to CSR reporting in line with legitimacy theory.\\n\\n# 2.2.2. CEO duality\\n\\nIn the one-tier system, the theoretical necessity for an internal division between executive and non-executive duties on the board of directors arises from the notion that management is mainly guided by the intent to maximize its own profit and wealth on the one hand while shirking responsibility on the other (Ross, 1973; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). In the so-called CEO duality model, in which the chief executive officer (CEO) is also the chair of the board, major conflicts of interest may arise (Tirole, 1986). There are increased risks when companies carry out their own assessments, as the chairperson of the board needs to evaluate situations that are associated with his or her own functions as CEO. Thus, according to stakeholder-agency theory, the CEO duality model should be avoided. At the same time, suitable and effective management advice from the board necessitates their comprehensive knowledge of business strategy. This can be relevant in CSR reporting. Furthermore, the avoidance of the CEO duality model may be attributed to self-impression management in order to attract new stakeholders.\\n\\nCEO duality is a very common board composition variable in empirical research with mixed results. Negative impacts of CEO duality on CSR reporting are stated by Muttakin and Subramaniam (2015), Li et al. (2010) and Lim et al. (2008). Among others, Jizi et al. (2014) found a positive impact. With regard to the mixed theoretical and empirical research results, the following hypotheses are stated:\\n\\n- H2a: Absence of CEO duality is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory.\\n- H2b: Absence of CEO duality is negatively linked to CSR reporting in line with legitimacy theory.\\n\\n# 2.2.3. Gender diversity\\n\\nBy taking gender diversity of boards into account, several arguments concerning CSR reporting can be stressed. For instance, Hillman et al. (2000) state that gender diversity provides various resources that benefit the company in terms of CSR reporting. Thus, the greater efficiency of monitoring activities can be explained by better information processing and a willingness on the part of the management to engage in dialogue (Carter et al., 2010). Many psychological studies confirmed that gender diversity may be connected with a more open mind discussion and creating innovative strategies like CSR reporting (Wood et al., 1985). Research has partly confirmed the positive influence of gender diversity on board effectiveness. Psychological researchers state that female board members are more risk-averse than their male colleagues so that they are more alike to fulfil stakeholders’ interests (Konrad et al., 2008). As CSR reporting contributes to stakeholders’ information needs, women on boards will contribute to an increased awareness of CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory. The predominance of research focusing on gender diversity on boards of directors can be attributed to its comparative simplicity of categorization as well as to the long-running socio-political debate over whether a fixed quota of women on boards should be established by law. The link between gender diversity on CSR reporting can also be negative according to the legitimacy theory. As gender diversity is a very political topic, it could be used as a symbolic strategy of management without any impact on CSR reporting quality. With regard to critical mass theory, the election of one or few female board member may be even ineffective. In view of the huge discussion of gender diversity from an international perspective, current empirical research often includes this board composition variable and finds mixed results. We recognize both positive (e.g. Kilic et al., 2015; Barako & Brown, 2008) and negative (e.g. Handajani et al., 2014) results. A current meta-analysis of former studies found a positive link between gender diversity and CSR performance (Byron & Post, 2016). As the author’s mix CSR performance and CSR reporting studies in their sample, it is not clear whether the positive', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ec2e6ed5-b829-4c13-9713-e9eed25e2104', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\\n\\n# 2.2.4. Board size\\n\\nFrom the perspective of stakeholder-agency theory, an appropriate amount of board members seems to be most important to guarantee a good quality of board effectiveness (Jensen, 1993). But large boards can also result in flawed incentives to engage in free-rider behaviour (McConnell & Servaes, 1990). Thus, board size is a controversial corporate governance variable. In line with legitimacy theory, flexibility and dynamism of the decision-making process can be reduced as the number of board members increases (Cheng, 2008). Insufficient critical self-reflection and a lower level of process discussion can be the consequence, thereby resulting in lower board effectiveness (Lipton & Lorsch, 1992). Moreover, monitoring requirements within the board increase along with board size, which requires more resources with respect to time and special experience. Insofar, an “optimal” board size is related to individual firm factors and maybe not the best board composition indicator to influence CSR reporting.\\n\\nFurthermore, the empirical results on board size are mixed. Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016), Janggu et al. (2014) and Jizi et al. (2014) found a positive impact of board size on CSR reporting. According to Abduh and AlAgeely (2015), among others, board size was negatively related to CSR reporting. With regard to the mixed theoretical and empirical research results, the following hypotheses are stated:\\n\\n- H4a: Board size is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder agency-theory.\\n- H4b: Board size is negatively linked to CSR reporting according to legitimacy theory.\\n\\n# 2.3. Country-specific governance variables as moderators\\n\\nAs we argue that board composition variables on the firm level have an impact on CSR reporting, country-specific governance factors may serve as moderating variables. Common measures in empirical research are the degree of shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law systems. In line with prior research (e.g. Post & Byron, 2015; Byron & Post, 2016) and with stakeholder-agency theory, we assume that a positive (negative) relationship between board composition variables and CSR reporting will be stronger (weaker) in countries with higher shareholder protection, higher legal enforcement, and existence of a code law regime. Shareholder protection, in particular interests of minority shareholders and legal enforcement ensure an appropriate market pressure on listed companies (Post & Byron, 2015; Byron & Post, 2016). As shareholders represent one of the key stakeholders of listed firms, it is obvious, that sustainable investors with nonfinancial goals increased their influence during the last years. Code law systems are linked with an increased stakeholder focus which also highlights the relevance of CSR reporting. Thus, country-specific governance attributes support stakeholders’ interests on the firm level. This leads to the following hypotheses:\\n\\n- H5: The relationship between the included board composition variables and CSR reporting is moderated by the strength of shareholder protection in line with stakeholder agency-theory.\\n- H6: The relationship between the included board composition variables and CSR reporting is moderated by the strength of legal enforcement in line with stakeholder-agency theory.\\n- H7: The relationship between the included board composition variables and CSR reporting is moderated by code law systems in line with stakeholder-agency theory.\\n\\n# 3. METHOD AND DATA\\n\\n# 3.1. Criteria for inclusion\\n\\nOur meta-analysis focuses on the link between board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size on the one hand and CSR reporting on the other hand. To be included, studies were published in journals by September 2018 and written in the English language. Moreover, the research papers had to include an effect size or include data that could be used to calculate an effect size for the meta-analysis. The corresponding authors of studies that did not include an effect size were contacted. If the authors provided the requested data, we include the respective study in our sample for our meta-analysis. Otherwise, we exclude the research paper.\\n\\n# 3.2. Search strategy and paper selection\\n\\nWe included empirical studies in our meta-analysis by international databases (Web of Science, Google Scholar, SSRN, EBSCO, and Science Direct). A targeted search was conducted for the keywords “corporate (social) responsibility reporting”, “corporate (social) responsibility disclosure”, “CSR reporting”, “CSR disclosures”, “sustainability disclosure”, as well as “sustainability reporting”, “environmental reporting”, and “social reporting”. Furthermore, the search was either broadened by the addition of the broader terms “corporate governance” and “board composition” or narrowed by the addition of specific variables (e.g., gender diversity). We did not limit our selection to a specific country or time. We focused on empirical-quantitative studies as the dominant research method in this field. For reasons of quality assurance, only the contributions published in international (English) journals with double-blind review were included. As of the end of September 2018, 64 studies corresponding to the selection criteria mentioned above were identified. Due to definitional differences, this set of studies was narrowed further. Our analysis is based on the definition of CSR reporting as a voluntary report as part of the annual report or a stand-alone report that covers economic, social and environmental issues in line with widely recognized CSR reporting standards, e.g. the guidelines of the GRI.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7e4b4210-b214-4dd4-b6b3-9e0d4dd5d505', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\\n\\nFurthermore, we do not include empirical studies with a clear focus on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon disclosure as a single dimension of CSR reporting (i.e., the ecological dimension), not in line with the triple bottom line. We do not include empirical studies on the link between board composition and integrated reporting. In comparison to a CSR report, integrated reporting conducted in according to the framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC, 2013) represents a different approach that aims to combine financial and CSR reports based on the concept of integrated thinking (Frias-Aceituno et al., 2013b; Stacchezzini et al., 2016). We only include publications with regression analyses on the link between at least one of our board composition variables and CSR reporting. This results in a final sample of 51 empirical studies.\\n\\nThe studies were all published or prepared within the last 14 years (2004–2018) with a clear increase in recent years. In contrast to much of the empirical corporate governance research, few studies analyzed the US-American and the European market. Developing countries were very attractive for sample selection. Cross-country studies were not common. Many of the research findings were published in accounting, corporate governance, and business ethics journals. A commonly used medium for this type of research is the Journal of Business Ethics, in which six studies were published.\\n\\n# 3.3. Board composition and CSR reporting variables\\n\\nReflecting the heterogeneous literature on the link between board composition variables and CSR reporting, the studies included in this meta-analysis examined the variables in a number of ways. Although there are some critics of meta-analyses in general, our method can include studies that are diverse in terms of sample and measurement (Velte, 2018). Board independence represents our first independent variable in our study and is operationalized in different ways. Most of our included studies refer to non-executive directors. Some papers rely on a two-tier system and therefore analyze the independence of supervisory board members, on board members without being a large shareholder or external directors without managerial ownership. CEO duality is normally measured through a dummy variable and is most homogeneous. The same applies to board size as the number of directors on the board. In most studies, gender diversity was measured by the percentage of female directors. Some studies also analyzed the presence of women by a dichotomous variable. In empirical research, CSR reporting can be operationalized either by including a self-constructed CSR disclosure score or by reference to an external CSR disclosure rating (e.g. KLD, Bloomberg, AssetFour). We do not include those studies without any link to CSR disclosures (e.g. information on the existence of firm donations to CSR institutions) in order to increase comparability. In total, the included studies in our meta-analysis found mixed results with regard to the impact of board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size on CSR reporting (positive, negative and insignificant regression results) (see also Velte, 2017).\\n\\n# 3.4. Country-specific variables as moderators\\n\\nThree moderator variables are used in our analysis: 1) shareholder protection; 2) legal enforcement and 3) code law regime. Our first moderator variable is shareholder protection strength, which is important in country-specific governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Leuz et al., 2003). We use the shareholder protection index by the World Bank (2018) as a simple average of the extent of conflict of interest regulation and extent of shareholder governance indices. The range of the score is between 0 and 10. Our second moderator variable is legal enforcement strength. We refer to the rule of law index provided by the World Justice Project (2016) as the recognition of various factors for a country’s legal system’s effectiveness, e.g. absence of corruption and regulatory enforcement, scaled from to 1. Finally, we introduce a dummy variable 1 if the specific country in the study has a code law regime and zero if the country represents a case law regime. We refer to the classification by La Porta et al. (2008).\\n\\n# 3.5. Meta-analytical strategy\\n\\nThe main goal of our meta-analysis is to summarize and quantify the heterogeneous results in different studies that focus on the impact of board composition on CSR reporting. A key issue in meta-analysis econometrics is the measurement of the effect size, which represents the magnitude of the relationship between the variables (Velte, 2018). In our meta-analysis, the effect size is measured by the average correlation coefficient of the included studies, and the effect size is most important to measure the influence of our board composition variables on CSR reporting. We refer to the meta-analytic technique by Hedges and Olkin (1990); (see Appendix for further information).\\n\\n# 4. RESULTS\\n\\nTable 1 presents the results of our meta-analysis of the link between board composition (board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size) and CSR reporting. We include shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law as moderating variables. All of our independent variables are positively linked with CSR reporting. Board independence and gender diversity also indicate a significant positive relationship with CSR reporting, whereas the absence of CEO duality and board size are insignificantly related to CSR reporting (Table 1). With regard to our moderating variables, both shareholder protection, and legal enforcement strengthen the positive impact of board independence and gender diversity on CSR reporting. In both situations, shareholder protection is linked with an increased effect size (0.120; 0.151) in comparison to the effect sizes without the moderator (board independence: 0.113; gender diversity: 0.140). Code law does not moderate the relationship between board independence, gender diversity and CSR reporting.\\n\\n11 http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/protecting-minority-investors; http://www.doingbusiness.org/methodology/protecting-minority-investors.\\n\\n12 https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/wjp-rule-law-index/wjp-rule-law-index-2016.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7f7be6f8-3a53-44d8-8e5b-ab5001fcff68', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\\n\\n# Table 1.

The critical mass theory indicates that a critical mass of women on boards is necessary to change board attitude towards CSR strategy and reporting. Surprisingly, up to now, sustainable management compensation and the structure thereof have not been analyzed so far.\\n\\nIn line with these recommendations, future research should also include other board composition variables that might have an impact on CSR reporting. The first useful variable to include in future CSR research is board tenure diversity. Rao and Tilt (2016b) state that short-term relationships may contribute to limited awareness of CSR reporting because the specific board member has only little firm-specific knowledge. Another variable that is not well recognized in current research on CSR reporting is the existence of multiple directorships. According to Elsakit and Worthington (2014), the participation of the chairman of the board in discussions regarding CSR reporting is expected to have a positive impact on CSR reporting. Finally, as board diversity represents one of the main board composition variables in current empirical research, board outcome is the result of the collective discussion, so that an overall diversity variable is useful to analyze the combined effect of diversity on CSR reporting. The “Blau index” (Blau, 1977) has reached a key relevance in empirical diversity research, but not in CSR reporting research (Rao & Tilt, 2016b).\\n\\nMultinational studies are not very common in our sample. There is a need for further research because a key aspect is the impact of different cultures in different countries on board composition and CSR reporting practice as a mediator, with special reference to the risk of litigation (Morros, 2016). Culture is relevant in view of the different ranges of stakeholder pressure on CSR reporting practice in a specific society. Most of our included studies contribute to developing countries and only differ between the banking industry and other industries. We encourage future researchers to focus on European member states with regard to the huge regulations on board composition and CSR reporting during the last years. It seems to be important to analyze the different branches of non-financial industries to a greater extent (e.g. pharmacy, automobiles) as the contents of CSR reporting will differ.\\n\\nOur meta-analysis has also main regulatory implications. In contrast to the US-American capital market, the European legislator and other regimes (e.g. South Africa) have finalized reform initiatives on board composition and CSR reporting since the financial crisis. The intention is to increase the motives for high quality CSR reporting. However, we know very little if these regulations will positively contribute to board effectiveness and CSR reporting. The related implementation and transaction costs and the market implications of a decision-useful CSR reporting are rather a “black box”. Sustainable management behaviour won’t be generally generated by stricter regulations on board composition and CSR reporting. In order to prevent greenwashing of CSR reporting and information overflow, the board of directors must implement a sustainable vision and philosophy as a top-down approach in accordance with the total employees and permanent dialogue with related departments (e.g. finance and accounting) (Schaltegger & Zvezdov, 2015).\\n\\nPractical implications can be also stressed. In general, the included studies in our meta-analysis found rather low CSR reporting scores in their descriptive statistics. Insofar, there are many possibilities for improvements in CSR reporting activities. Management should not only be aware of the reporting costs but also on the positive link on firm reputation and stakeholder trust, which could lead to better (non) financial performance in the long run. However, CSR practices may not generally be transformed into decision-useful CSR reporting (Majeed et al., 2015). Insofar, firms without CSR reporting can be active in CSR management and may plan to introduce a CSR report in the future. Even though some studies indicate that PIEs have higher CSR disclosure scores, also small and medium-sized entities are aware of CSR, especially family firms.\\n\\n# 6. CONCLUSION\\n\\nEmpirical research on the impact of board composition on CSR reporting has increased since the last decade. As CSR reporting usually includes corporate governance information, e.g. sustainable management compensation or gender diversity, there many interdependencies between corporate governance and CSR reporting (“sustainable corporate governance”). In view of the heterogeneous results of empirical-quantitative research and with regard to the variety of board attributes, our meta-analysis focuses on common board attributes, namely board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size, and their impact on CSR reporting based on 51 studies. According to our theoretical framework, we assume both a positive (agency theory) and negative (legitimacy theory) impact of our board composition variables on CSR reporting. Our meta-analysis indicates that board independence and gender diversity are positively and significantly linked with CSR reporting. Furthermore, we examine whether this relationship is moderated by country-specific governance attributes. We find that board independence and gender diversity are more positively related to CSR reporting in countries with a higher range of shareholder protection and legal enforcement. We do not find any evidence for a moderator effect of code law regimes.\\n\\nWe also offer recommendations to researchers, practice, and regulators in our paper. While CEO duality and board size are commonly used as board composition variables, their explanatory power is rather limited. They should be regarded as control variables and not as independent variables. Board independence and gender diversity are very common in empirical research, but other items, e.g. board expertise, multiple directorships, or board tenure, and should be also integrated. The variety of CSR reporting measures decrease the comparability of empirical research, especially by self-constructed CSR disclosure scores. But the recognition of external CSR disclosure ratings is also problematic.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c75da820-d492-4fef-ad06-dc8da706058b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\\n\\nin view of their “black box” character. We find that developing countries are very attractive in related empirical research. As many regulations on board composition and CSR reporting have been implemented in developed countries during the last years, other regimes should be included, e.g. EU member states with one-tier and two-tier systems and with a separation of different branches of industries.\\n\\nFinally, integrated reporting research has also increased in empirical research during the last years (Frias-Aceituno et al., 2013b; Stacchezzini et al., 2016; Velte & Stawinoga, 2017). Integrated reporting should complement CSR reports as it includes material aspects of financial and nonfinancial reporting. In contrast to CSR reporting, we know little about the impact of corporate governance variables on the integrated reporting quality (Haji & Anifowose, 2016; Gerwanski et al., 2019). The applicability of recent research results on sustainable CSR reporting to integrated reporting had to be neglected owing to the divergent concepts of CSR reporting and integrated reporting. Nevertheless, recent research methods tailored to studying board composition and CSR reporting will be used for analyzing possible determinants of integrated reporting quality in the future.\\n\\n# REFERENCES\\n\\n1.

If the calculated value exceeds the tabulated one for the specified level of significance, homogeneous correlations do not exist. Furthermore, we measure the level of heterogeneity according to the Higgins and Thompson I2 statistic:\\n\\nThe full sample is divided into different sub-samples according to the values of the discrete variables to test the significance of our included moderating effects. The approach described above is then applied to each sub-sample to analyze differences in the impact of board composition variables on CSR reporting between groups identified using the moderating variables shareholder rights, legal enforcement, and code law.\\n\\n59', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}')]\n",

They also have the potential to boost software engineering productivity. In this article we elaborate technologies and usage of Generative AI in the software industry. We address questions such as: How does Generative AI improve software productivity? How to connect Generative AI to software development, and what are the risks? Which technologies have what sort of benefits? Practitioner guidance and case studies are shared from our industry context. I look forward to hearing from you about this column and the technologies that matter most for your work.\\n\\n—Christof Ebert\\n\\nDOI Keywords: Generative AI, ChatGPT, productivity, software engineering, software technology\\n\\n# Generative AI has the potential to change the software profession more than any other recent technology.\\n\\nBill Gates sees it as the biggest move forward since the invention of the Internet. It can improve software productivity in several ways, such as automating repetitive tasks such as testing or requirements traceability, improve software quality by creating test suites from requirements, and automating workflows by routing work products to the next suitable step in a production pipeline. At the same time generative AI creates fully new risks because it is neither deterministic nor explainable. IPR and Cybersecurity are prominent examples that limit usage in professional software engineering.\\n\\n# Generative AI Technologies\\n\\nGenerative AI has been around for many years. With no means to prove validity, researchers hesitated to bring such technology to the mass market of rather naïve data citizens. As we have observed many times in recent IT history, the perceived gold rush makes people closing eyes in front of obvious risks. Even tools designed for good will eventually have devastating consequences. When ChatGPT was finally released to a wide public audience in 2022, the AI arms race started at a speed never seen before. It took for ChatGPT just two months to reach a hundred million users. Fig. 1 shows this fast evolution for different technologies spanning a mere hundred years of recent human history. A technology like the wheel even took thousands of years to reach a hundred million users.\\n\\nFor every developer, turning to StackOverflow or Google has been a natural part of the job for years now. Condemning the Not Invented Here Syndrome to the dustbin, our first reaction when in doubt how to code something has been to look it up on the internet. Search engines have got better at indexing code repositories, myriads of which exist online, and community advice sites, such as StackOverflow, provide reasoned solutions and valuable commentary on user questions. What is common in search engines and question and answer websites is that you can lookup information that has already been stored there.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='4a539012-53dc-401c-839d-7c444c02efe9', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative AI is different.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, it can synthesize, or generate, the answers to the questions you pose. Instead of trawling a prefabricated answer as classic search engines are doing, it will create an answer for you. The answer is based on vast amounts of data on which it has been trained, such as those archived and indexed by search engines. To provide meaningful answers, Generative AI undergoes further training based on human feedback. Many human trainers pose questions and provide feedback on the generated answers, rewarding good answers and punishing unsatisfying ones. This kind of reinforcement learning guides the system towards providing more accurate answers, while guarding against harmful responses. This has led to glimpses of a new way of working, where the focus is on “prompt engineering”: find the most appropriate way to frame a question, or a whole dialog. Generative AI does not work with individual question and answers: it maintains a context window, which can be used to guide the AI in generating contextually relevant and well-informed responses.\\n\\n# Time to reach 100 Mio Users\\n\\n|ChatGPT|2| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|TikTok| |40| |\\n|WhatsApp| |40| |\\n|Internet| |80| |\\n|Mobile Phone| |190| |\\n|Car| | |400|\\n|Telephone| | |900|\\n\\nFig. 1: Time to reach 100 million users for different technologies in months after initial deployment.\\n\\nUnderlying all this, Generative AI is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As the name suggests, these are large neural network models that are trained on big language corpora. Technically, they have a Transformer architecture, which is based on a mechanism called attention. The publication of the attention mechanism, by Google researchers, must now rank among the most influential papers in Computer Science [1]. Two early LLMs were BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), developed by Google in 2018 [2], and GPT-1 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1), developed by OpenAI who went on to develop subsequent GPT models, getting to GPT-4 today [3].\\n\\nThe basic idea is to use a large language corpus to train a neural network to learn the language, by hiding part of the text and asking the network to guess the missing parts [4]. The neural network does that by paying selective attention to the words comprising the surrounding context of the missing parts. The words themselves are represented as vectors, called embeddings, in a multi-dimensional space. In essence, the neural network learns, and represents the meaning of each word in a numerical format, which can then be processed by the AI model. This is achieved by mapping words to vectors in a high-dimensional space, where words with similar meanings are situated closer together. These probabilistic representations can then be used to generate entirely new text – for instance, the answer to a query. When we talk about language and words, we are not restricted to human language: it can be computer code, having code tokens instead of words; the idea is the same.\\n\\nYou can see a simplified depiction of the internals of a LLM in Fig. 2. The model follows the transformer architecture [4]. The inputs, which are language or code tokens, are represented as vector embeddings. Then they go through an encoder, which is a series of attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms are an algorithm used in LLMs that enables the AI to focus on specific parts of the input text when generating an output.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='dc16835b-4190-45e7-8a45-eaf6766a924b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Output of the Encoder\\n\\nThe output of the encoder is a vector representation of the input, which is produced by analyzing surrounding context and attentions. You can think of the encoder’s output as the meaning of the input, as understood by the neural network.\\n\\nOnce we have the encoded input, we need to transform it to the desired output, that is, take it from a vector representation and transform it back to a language or code token. To do this we feed it to another series of attention mechanisms, the decoder. The output of the decoder are candidate tokens, which are then assigned probabilities. The most probable token is the final output. These probabilities result from training the entire transformer model, including both the encoder and decoder, with vast amounts of text. ChatGPT is said to be trained with the “entire internet”. The training process is referred to as \"self-supervised learning\" (or \"masked language modeling\"), which is achieved by hiding some parts of known text and checking the quality of how it is automatically completed. In this way the decoder will learn to predict the missing output given the encoded input. After training, the model receives prompts or queries. Each prompt will be encoded as before and then fed to the decoder. This time the decoder works only with the encoded input as we don’t have a known output at hand. With adequate training, the model will predict a useful final output. Obviously with restricted domains, such as code fragments or test cases, the LLM needs less training.\\n\\n# Fig. 2: Generative AI Technology\\n\\n|Probabilities|Calculate|Probabilities|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |Encoder|Decoder|\\n| |Output|Output|\\n| |Attention|Attention|\\n| |Attention|Attention|\\n| |Input|Output|\\n| |Embedding|Embedding|\\n| |Inputs|Outputs|\\n\\n# Generative AI for Developers\\n\\nSeveral generative software platforms are available, which allow to turn simple instructions into computer code. GitHub Copilot is available as an extension to development tools and editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim and JetBrain IDEs. It offers code autocomplete that is powered by OpenAI Codex, a Generative AI system developed also by OpenAI. A tantalizing development is the recent announcement of Copilot X, powered by GPT-4, which apart from improved autocompletion can aid in other development tasks, such as understanding code, improving pull requests, and aiding in scripting and shell tools.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='e50315d4-af50-4d31-9d0b-0d9c5e027b40', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative AI for Software Productivity\\n\\nGPT-4 can generate code from docstrings and solve coding questions in software engineering interviews on a par or surpassing human performance. It can program for the front-end and interact with LaTeX. It can reverse engineer code, execute Python code, and execute pseudo code. OpenAI, the company behind GPT-4, offers programmatic access to its LLMs. That means that developers can use them not only in conversational manner, but also embed them into their applications. It is also possible to develop plugins, which are ways to connect the underlying models with third-party services that can respond to questions and act on them.\\n\\nCode completion, at a line or whole function level is offered by Tabnine, which positions itself apart from the competition by paying special attention to licensing and privacy issues. Tabnine has been trained only on open-source software with permissive licenses. Moreover, it assures developers that it does not retain any of the code in which it is used, and it is also possible to download and use the underlying models locally, instead of only being accessible as a service.\\n\\nTable 1 summarizes some mainstream technologies. Note that the landscape changes very fast. If anything, we can expect existing tools to improve, and new tools to enter the scene.\\n\\n|Name|URL|Technology|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|ChatGPT|https://chat.openai.com/|GPT-4|\\n|CoPilot|https://github.com/features/copilot|OpenAI CodeX, GPT-4|\\n|Tabnine|https://www.tabnine.com/|Proprietary ML engine trained with OSS|\\n|Hugging Face (various different models)|https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index|Transformer, details vary depending on the model|\\n|Cost|Use cases| |\\n|$20 per month for the chat interface; pricing for API use depends on usage.|Code completion, code generation, code comprehension, reverse engineering, pseudo code reasoning and execution.| |\\n|$10 per month/$100 per year for individuals, $19 per user per month for business plans.|Code completion for CoPilot; CoPilot X uses the more advanced GPT-4 model and can answer questions based on code documentation; aid in pull requests, shell commands and scripting.| |\\n|Basic tier is free, Pro tier starts at $12 month/user, also possible to self-host.|Code completion.

Application domains with a high business impact are the following:\\n\\n- Media content creation, e.g., text, audio, video, pictures, content for news feed and social media\\n- Media content improvement, i.e., from making enhancements, references (though mostly they hallucinate and invent references that do not exist), and explanations up to augmented content generation with pay per use.\\n- Generative design, such as chip-design in semiconductor business, developing novel building and city architectures, material design in chemical plants, innovative drugs and medication in pharma industries.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='a58ab89a-fce6-43f3-a1e8-25c1ce5e6ca3', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Software Development and Generative AI\\n\\nSoftware development, such as code generation, test case generation from requirements, re-establishing traceability, explaining code, refactoring of legacy code, software maintenance with augmented guidance and improving existing code. We will focus here on improving software development and software productivity with generative AI (see sidebar with “Generative AI Industry Case Study” for an application).\\n\\nEven though we have focused on code-related tasks, the capabilities of generative AI tools extend well beyond assisting in writing code. Generative AI can improve software productivity in various aspects of Software Engineering, such as:\\n\\n# Enhancing Creativity\\n\\nGenerative AI can assist developers in generating new ideas and solutions for software and UX development. For example, it can help developers to generate new designs, logos, and user interfaces.\\n\\n# Summarizing Documentation\\n\\nLLMs are particularly good at these tasks, freeing time for other tasks. Generative AI responds to prompts, and these prompts can be customized and pre-defined for various tasks, such as automatic search and enhancements. We can give the prompts through API calls, in this way integrating the use of LLMs with our development pipeline.\\n\\n# Problem Solving\\n\\nGenerative AI has been shown to be able to exhibit mathematical and algorithmic abilities, though currently still weak, because the LLMs were not trained to interpret the meaning of numeric representations and complex relationships between numbers. Programmers can describe a problem that needs to be solved and provide some guidance on how to solve it (e.g., “use dynamic programming”) and then the tool can generate code to the task. For instance, you provide a requirement like: \"Make a list of major taxation laws in country X in Python language\" and you will get a usable piece of code including well-named variables and documentation. For a wide variety of problems, Generative AI will spit out a usable solution, especially where commonly used algorithms are involved. Also, here we have new challenges, namely the more detailed and not trivial your request, the higher the probability that the code contains errors, which you will not find as you don’t know how to test exception cases.\\n\\n# Efficient Development\\n\\nIt can be used to streamline software development processes by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and deployment. An example could be routing of tasks such as regression test. This can help to reduce development time and costs and improve overall productivity.\\n\\n# Maintaining Legacy\\n\\nMost software that is produced today is legacy or based on legacy. A lot of trusted safety-critical software in domains such as power plants or defense is decades old. Many federal systems are based on Cobol and other antiquated languages. The challenge is increasingly to find people able to maintain such legacy. Generative AI tools in future might explain how the code works and translates it into any other language, e.g., a Python code into JavaScript. In many cases, the AI not only points out possible quality problems, but it also provides better alternatives.\\n\\n# Improving Software Quality\\n\\nGenerative AI can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that human developers might miss. An example is the selection of appropriate test cases. This can help developers to write more accurate and efficient code, and to identify and fix bugs more quickly. New challenges arise such as how to ensure that AI-based systems would not be validated by AI systems that are programmed to overlook certain defects or backdoors. Deep fake applies to software even more than only pictures.\\n\\n# Improving Data Quality\\n\\nAn important feature of using Generative AI for software-related tasks is the ability to fine tune an existing model on specific data. LLMs are trained on open data that is trawled from the internet, and their answers are based on what they can learn from that data. It is possible, through appropriate APIs, to give to LLMs our own data. The typical steps are to prepare our training data, then upload them to the model and let it train on that data, on top of its existing training. Then we used the fine-tuned model, which will be able to provide more relevant answers to our prompts, either typed in, or through API calls.\\n\\n# Achieving Trust\\n\\nWhile traditional software is based on pre-defined algorithms, current software is adaptive, self-changing and learning. Such systems do not behave according to initial specifications and might even “unlearn” what they were initially developed to do. It is not meaningful to discuss the validation of AI systems without using nearly realistic systems and contexts. Testing non-deterministic systems is difficult with deterministic tests. With traditional software testing, release criteria are based on comparing reactions to a given series of inputs with expected outputs. Simulations of cyber-physical systems suffers from the enormous state space of AI systems if not applied purposefully. For instance, autonomous vehicles need several hundred million kilometers to statistically prove that they are suitable for real traffic. Synthetic data developed by Generative AI around corner cases and critical scenarios facilitates development, testing, approval, and homologation of automatic, robotic, and autonomous systems in critical industries such as medical, aerospace, mobility and industrial production [9].', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='785a58d3-c2cf-45bf-9166-f918174428db', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Hints for the Practitioner\\n\\nWhile Generative AI can help companies to grow competences there are several risks that need to be considered and mitigated [7]. Technology companies and especially their venture-capitalist backers tend to just look for fast money and repeat past mistakes, namely prioritizing growth over safety. OpenAI’s 2020 predecessor to ChatGPT for instance was known for “creative” outputs which were as easy to read and use as Wikipedia entries but were inhumane and racist [8]. Google explicitly announced plans to release a premature Bard, accepting the high risk it is willing to take when releasing tools based on AI technology. The lessons from social media should guide us in developing AI. What is labelled “social networks” had over the past ten years eroded true social connections and trust between people. With several hours per day on these networks mental-health and intelligence is declining at an alarming pace. Societies in many countries are deeply polarized due to fake news which is consumed without much thinking about it. Tools such as ChatGPT could further replace professional independent media and spread fake news that are neither traceable nor explainable. As developers we must get hands-on and deal with such risks.\\n\\nThe name of “Generative AI” cues the major pitfall. If humans rely on AI for information, it will be increasingly difficult to tell what is factual, what is an exaggerating advertisement, and what is completely made up for misinformation. The answers and solutions are generated by models based on probabilities, not necessarily found from some authoritative source. That means that they may be wrong. AI tools can hallucinate, responding in a wildly erroneous manner while being supremely confident that they are right. Things are improving (GPT-4 seems to be better than its predecessors), but the user should always check the answers. Relying on AI tools for tasks where you cannot determine the correct answer or how to verify it can lead to complications and pitfalls. For software development it means that human supervision and intervention is necessary, such as reviews.\\n\\nWith statistically driven synthesis of results, Generative AI does not have a real understanding of language. More dangerous is that it has no knowledge of the real world. The language model produces its “facts” with nice-to-read text or code. But it is the user’s responsibility to verify these statements. Creativity and the capability to detect defects are the most important characteristics that distinguish you and your code from an AI. Even if it is tempting to let an algorithm do as much work for you as possible, you should always be aware that it makes mistakes, which it admittedly packages very credibly. When users started posting bug fixes generated with tools such as ChatGPT, StackOverflow banned such posts. How do they identify the fake content? The same way as a professor today must verify homework assignments, namely by means of AI. It is an arms race, and quite good tools are around to identify AI-generated documents with statistical analyses.\\n\\nPractitioners should also be aware of privacy and security implications. When using a tool that analyses your code, you should be careful about what happens to that code. If your code is open source, then it probably does not matter that it may leave traces in the tool’s models, or even be used as training material for the tool itself. But in proprietary code, you may not wish for your code to leave the confines of your private repositories. Different tools give different assurances for that; you should read the terms of use carefully.\\n\\nIt is difficult to impossible to identify what is original work and what is generated fake, such as pictures and videos used for misinformation. Demanding a source statement will not work, because those who want evil, will not follow such self-imposed rules. Watermarks on all levels or being embedded up to steganographic algorithms can easily be removed. Forensic AI researchers propose using end-to-end blockchain trust mechanisms to label what has been a proven original piece of work. Yet the challenge remains to make the initial prove on which the blockchain will be based upon.\\n\\nA major risk is about cybersecurity of generated code. Generative AI tools and platform might be misused and trained to insert unwanted code fragments into any code they process. Such snippets might look innocent but could introduce backdoors, manipulate data, or feed information to external targets. Though this holds for any code reuse, cyber warfare will enter a new stage with AI-based generated code which is hard to understand and test. Verification and validation of AI will grow in relevance. Software practitioners need to enhance their competences on the right side of the \"V\" in order to verify accuracy of underlying AI and resulting artefacts.\\n\\nSoftware Engineering for and with AI must start with assertions that create boundaries of what is allowed and what not. Like Isaac Asimov’s robotic rules, our society and specifically IT professionals must specify upfront what is not (!) to happen. Requirements engineering must start with negative requirements, such as which misuse', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='38b5ab7a-b29b-4593-8ed0-e9e52451aac9', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# Generative AI and Software Engineering\\n\\nCases, confuse cases and abuse cases must be avoided, and what transformations would be explicitly allowed. Generative AI will in near future think and learn much more efficiently in certain areas than humans. With future AI systems rapidly improving themselves without human intervention, they could potentially wipe out humanity. A simple thought experiment would be ecology. Today many politicians put the climate change risks to extraordinary levels, forgetting about other challenges we have. A Generative AI that copies such single-minded behavior might conclude to just stop human life on earth to reduce climate change.\\n\\nIn a world of Generative AI and low code, it's hard to imagine a future where software engineers are as highly paid as today. Many traditional roles such as programmer will change. With the current evolution speed, we can expect that within the next three years most software companies will have an AI-augmented development and testing strategy, up from very few today. Most internet content and mobile apps will be fully or largely commanded by generative AI. Software developers will need new competencies, such as improving automatically generated software, feeding learning engines, and exploring behaviors which are not explainable. Generative AI will accelerate software development. Yet be aware of marketing hype on shortcuts to building secure, resilient software based on not deterministic technologies.\\n\\nThese are exciting times, not just for Software Engineers. Some even argue that we may witnessing the first sparks of Artificial General Intelligence [5] – or maybe not (yet) [6]. In any case Generative AI is here to stay, it is likely to be a game changer, and change Software Engineering as well. As with any new technology it can be used, misused, and abused. Elon Musk who is known for much, but not stopping innovations, demands oversight for artificial intelligence, having described the technology as “potentially more dangerous than nukes.” As those who develop this technology, we as leading practitioners must safeguard and control AI.\\n\\n# Side-Bar: Generative AI Industry Case Study\\n\\nAt Vector we are often called to improve the quality of software systems. One typical finding is insufficient requirements and test strategy. Some software is tested several times, while some requirements and scenarios remain untested, making increasingly complex software systems impossible to trust. While software development is simple, identifying the right requirements and test cases is a challenge for practically all companies. This is a high risk, especially when automating critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and finance systems. Policy makers demand trusted AI, which demands a clear specification of intended functionality, border cases and clear demarcation lines of what must not happen. With today level of requirements engineering and test methodology we are far away from trusted AI-systems.\\n\\nIn such cases requirements traceability ensures that requirements are properly tracked, verified, and validated throughout the development cycle. It is perceived as highly necessary and demanded by all standards along functional safety and cybersecurity. However, in practice traceability is not maintained, and most software systems today are insufficiently tested [9]. Here are some ways in which AI can help with requirements traceability:\\n\\n- Automated tagging and categorization: AI can be used to automatically tag and categorize requirements based on their type, priority, and other characteristics. This can help to ensure that requirements are properly tracked and easily searchable.\\n- Natural language processing: AI can be used to analyze natural language requirements and identify potential issues, such as ambiguous or conflicting requirements. It can also help to identify missing requirements or inconsistencies in the requirements documentation.\\n- Predictive analytics: AI can be used to analyze historical data and predict the likelihood of certain requirements being implemented successfully. This can help to identify potential risks and prioritize requirements accordingly.\\n- Testing automation: AI can be used to automate testing processes and ensure that each requirement is properly tested and verified. This can help to reduce the time and effort required for manual testing and improve overall testing accuracy.\\n\\nThe return of generative AI in connecting requirements engineering and testing comes in different currencies, namely less effort for maintaining traceability, higher product quality by test case updates even across heterogeneous tool chains, and better understanding of complex systems. The risks of generative AI remain as mentioned in the article. Be aware of your intellectual property rights and never upload software to external platforms. Do not take results of generative AI as sufficient to automate quality checks, because these tools are neither deterministic nor explainable in their chain-of-thought.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ebae43ba-b72e-405c-b8cf-7d18e488753c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# References\\n\\n1.

In so doing, this study provides a comprehensive discussion on this disruptive subject that inspires, provokes, excites, and engages hospitality and tourism scholars, researchers, educators, industry practitioners, and other stakeholders. This study further proposes an integrative conceptual framework of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms affects a wide range of HT stakeholders that may result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value through resource-based, ethical, financial, legal, educational, cultural, and technological mechanisms. By integrating the perspectives of more than 30 hospitality and tourism academics and practitioners on the conceptualization of this subject, the current study offers insight and foresight and may serve as a catalyst for further impactful research.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a form of artificial intelligence that can create various forms of original content. In contrast to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which can independently learn and execute a wide range of tasks and ideas (and is presently only hypothetical), GAI is referred to as “generative” because it can generate specific kinds of output, such as text, audio, images, and video, based on supervised or unsupervised training (Stening, 2023). Popular GAI tools include platforms such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Bard, DALL-E 2, and many others.\\n\\nThe potential impact of this technology on society and humanity is profound; and like all industries, the hospitality and tourism (HT) industry is poised for a wide range of exciting new advancements and unprecedented challenges as GAI continues to develop (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023a, 2023b; Mich & Garigliano, 2023). For example, when applied to marketing functions in the HT industry, GAI can use travel history, consumption preferences, and social media content to create personalized recommendations for travelers, generate descriptions of destinations and hotel properties, and even create virtual tours of hotels and attractions (Lalli, 2023), simultaneously creating value for firms and consumers. Likewise, on the financial side, GAI-enabled technologies can generate novel insights into portfolio optimization strategies, capital structure, key performance indicators, and fund allocations (Kizildag et al., 2019; Ozdemir et al., 2023), simultaneously creating value for firms and for society. Indeed, for nearly all functional areas of HT firms, there are potential applications of GAI that can be used to increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, enhance workplace productivity, and enrich the customer experience.\\n\\nDespite the excitement over the potential benefits of GAI, however, the adoption of such technologies comes with a set of ethical, social, and economic considerations. In many cases, the use of GAI is seen as a double-edged sword, where the solution to old problems can become the source of new ones (Zhuo et al., 2023). Many such problems have already arrived in the form of privacy and security concerns, intellectual property rights violations, and liability and accountability issues, to name only a few. In acknowledgment of both the promises and the challenges of GAI, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we seek to provide a critical examination of the effects of GAI applications across a broad spectrum of industrial and social stakeholders in HT. Second, we propose an integrative conceptual framework of GAI adoption in the HT industry that can be used in pursuit of meaningful future research in the field. Through the contribution of a wide range of academic and practical perspectives, this paper highlights the potential advantages and disadvantages of GAI and considers how GAI researchers can navigate the complexities of this rapidly evolving technology.\\n\\nIn taking such an approach, this paper develops a conceptual framework for the future exploration of GAI in hospitality and tourism research. As such, the purpose of this research is not to present a detailed account of the current state of GAI in the HT industry. Rather, the goal is to propose a framework that can be used to ensure that future GAI-based research is maximally relevant to practical hospitality and tourism management. In so doing, the study addresses Mondal and colleagues’ (2023) call for comprehensive models and frameworks to analyze the application of GAI in different sectors. Specifically, this paper takes a stakeholder theory perspective of the GAI phenomenon, providing an account of the potential benefits and challenges of GAI for HT firms in relation to customers, employees, suppliers, and many other stakeholders in the HT landscape. The end result is a list of 50 research questions that can be used to drive forward the exciting new era of GAI-based research in the HT industry.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nGiven that the goal of this research is the creation of a framework to drive the future of an emerging research phenomenon (i.e., GAI in the HT industry), an inductive methodological approach was taken. Specifically, 30 hospitality and tourism practitioners with a wide range of research and industrial expertise were selected to participate in this research. Rather than enlisting these experts as data points, all contributors were asked to take authorship of the paper. In accordance with the tenets of theoretical sampling, the contributors to (and thus, authors of) this research were carefully chosen to represent a broad range of hospitality and tourism expertise, including law, finance, marketing, operations, finance, accounting, strategic management, human resources, design, sustainability, restaurants, hotels, destinations, and travel.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='5c048001-3765-4aca-abac-bcf9be57022a', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\\n\\ndesigned to be collectively exhaustive or mutually exclusive, analysis of the content provided across the contributing authors indicated that most of the major functional areas of HT industries were represented.\\n\\nThe 30 hospitality and tourism experts were identified through the process of theoretical sampling and then contacted via e-mail to solicit their participation in the project. All 30 people who were contacted agreed to contribute. In order to ensure a common frame of reference across contributors, the e-mail contained a set of instructions for how to contribute. Specifically, each contributor was asked to write up to 500 words on the implications of GAI in the field of hospitality and tourism management. As per JHTR’s guidelines, contributors were asked to focus on “big ideas” that “generate transcendent insight that inspires, provokes, excites, and engages our audiences.” Additionally, contributors were expressly asked to provide an account of the transformative effects of GAI on HT industry stakeholders, focusing on what is already happening as well as what could potentially happen in the future. After providing this discussion, contributors were asked to provide an additional 100 to 200 words that would indicate the most imperative research questions pertaining to their writings.\\n\\nEach contributor was given 2 weeks to make their submission, with a reminder e-mail sent at the 1-week mark. The reminder e-mail reiterated the instructions regarding big ideas, stakeholder emphasis, and so forth. Once all writings were received, the analysis was conducted in two parts: (1) model development and writing integration and (2) development of research questions and ranking.\\n\\nTo develop the model, four of the authors acted as an editorial team to review, sort, aggregate, and interpret the submissions of the other authors. Through the process of thematic analysis and emergent design, an integrative framework (referred to as the REFLECT model) was developed. The primary themes inherent to the model included the functional areas of HT firms/industry domains in which GAI is adopted/implemented; the stakeholders in the HT landscape affected by GAI adoption; and the mechanisms through which these effects are calibrated (i.e., REFLECT factors). Consistent with the value creation perspective of stakeholder theory, the final emergent theme was the dual processes of co-creation and co-destruction of value that are manifested in a reciprocal nature via the other three components of the model. The writings of all the authors were then organized around the four emergent themes. Specifically, the editorial team collaborated via video conferencing to organize and edit all the written submissions of the other authors. In this way, this research and the end results (i.e., the sections of the manuscript that follow) is not a set of standalone contributions; rather, this manuscript represents the integration of a large and diverse group of experts, presented in a unified model and driven by an inductively-derived theoretical framework.\\n\\nFinally, the research directives and/or questions submitted by each author were reviewed. As before, the four editorial authors worked together to combine these contributions into a list of 50 specific questions across four different categories: general directives, GAI application questions, REFLECT-based questions, and stakeholder-based questions. A survey was then designed to allow each contributing author to rate each question on a 5-point importance scale ranging from “not at all important” to “extremely important.” This survey was then sent to all authors to complete. The results of this survey are presented in tabular form in the concluding section of the manuscript and highlight key areas of future inquiry into the GAI phenomenon.\\n\\n# Emergent Framework of GAI in the HT Industry: The REFLECT Model\\n\\nThe themes and processes emerging from the methodological approach outlined above are proposed in a framework referred to hereafter as the REFLECT model of value co-creation and value-co-destruction (see Figure 1). This model provides an account of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms (e.g., operations, management, marketing, etc.) can affect a wide range of social and industrial stakeholders. In the model, the HT firm is the principal agent of value creation in the hospitality ecosystem. The impact of firm-enabled GAI applications on various stakeholders is mediated by a variety of factors (the REFLECT mechanisms) that must be optimally calibrated to ensure that the firm maximizes the value created across the system, for as many stakeholders as possible.\\n\\nWhile the HT firm has agency for creating and capturing value in a GAI-enabled hospitality ecosystem, the REFLECT model is predicated on two important considerations. First, in line with the service-dominant logic (SDL) of the firm, the value dynamics identified in the model are non-recursive in nature. GAI applications are fundamentally based on stakeholder interaction and engagement; thus, stakeholders are not passive recipients of a firm’s value proposition, but instead “co-create” (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004) and/or “co-destroy” (Ple & Caceres, 2010) value in the system. This latter possibility that GAI implementation can have adverse consequences leading to value co-destruction has been identified in extant research (e.g., Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Houde et al., 2020). For example, value is co-destroyed by a firm’s employees if they sabotage GAI applications that they perceive to be a threat to their jobs, because management did not enable an organizational culture conducive to GAI implementation and/or did not educate employees on the implications of GAI for their work.\\n\\nSecond, the value co-creation and co-destruction feedback loops indicate that the benefits of using GAI to facilitate mutually beneficial firm-stakeholder relationships (i.e., value co-creation) may, in turn, create friction in other stakeholder relationships (i.e., value co-destruction). For example, an improved customer experience due to GAI application may result in a loss of agency for employees, leading to lower job morale and engagement. Such friction can likely...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='bef3aecd-b6b7-48e1-94e4-3e195b6c2ad3', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Co-creation of Value\\n\\n# Co-destruction of Value\\n\\n# HT Firm\\n\\n# REFLECT\\n\\n# Strategic Management\\n\\n# Destinations\\n\\n# Marketing\\n\\n# Operations\\n\\n# Resource-Based View\\n\\n# Financial\\n\\n# Ethical\\n\\n# Revenue Management\\n\\n# Accounting\\n\\n# Finance\\n\\n# Human Resources\\n\\n# Educational\\n\\n# Cultural\\n\\n# Legal\\n\\n# Design\\n\\n# Technological\\n\\n# Co-creation of Value\\n\\n# Co-destruction of Value\\n\\nFigure 1. Source of Value Co-Creation/Co-Destruction for HT Stakeholders.\\nStakeholderEmployeesCustomersIndustryShareholdersGovernmentSuppliersSociety\\n\\nbe mitigated by a consideration and calibration of the mediating REFLECT mechanisms, as will be explained in subsequent sections.\\n\\nThe model’s emphasis on value creation aligns with the principles of the stakeholder theory of the firm, which emphasizes the interconnected relationships between a business and its various stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, employees, investors, and communities. According to stakeholder theory, a company should create value for all stakeholders, rather than solely focusing on shareholders (Freeman et al., 2010). This theory combines the resource-based view and market-based view of the firm, while also considering sociopolitical factors (Phillips, 2003). It is important to note that stakeholder theory serves as a framework, providing a basis for various derived theories and models (Freeman et al., 2010), such as the one offered in the present study.\\n\\nConsidering the objective of our study, which aims to propose a framework ensuring that future research on GAI remains relevant to practical hospitality and tourism management, we developed the REFLECT model through an inductive analysis of authors’ writings. These writings, in turn, were based on prompts that prioritize the significance of stakeholders (Freeman et al., 2010). Furthermore, since GAI is a novel technology with potential applications in the hospitality industry, it presents both promising opportunities and ethical, legal, social, and economic challenges. Adopting a more inclusive and balanced approach that considers the needs and experiences of multiple stakeholders can facilitate ethical decision-making and foster mutually beneficial relationships, ultimately contributing to sustainable organizational success in GAI implementation.\\n\\nThe components and dynamics of the REFLECT model are thematically consistent with other frameworks that have been devised based on stakeholder theory (see Freudenreich et al., 2020; Mihailova et al., 2022), and, in this study, emphasize sustainable value creation via GAI application for HT firms. As follows, this manuscript integrates the perspectives of more than 30 hospitality and tourism academics and/or practitioners in terms of (1) GAI applications at the firm level and their potential for value co-creation and value co-destruction; (2) the REFLECT-based mechanisms through which such GAI applications can facilitate value co-creation and value co-destruction for industry stakeholders; and (3) the research questions that arise from the relationships in the REFLECT model.\\n\\n# GAI Applications at the Firm Level\\n\\n# Strategic Management\\n\\nGAI has the ability to profoundly influence strategic management within the HT industry. In this context, strategic management is defined as “the process through which firms define their missions, visions, goals, and objectives, as well as craft and execute strategies at various levels of the firms’ hierarchies to create and sustain a competitive advantage” (Okumus et al., 2019, p. 5). Leadership plays a critical role in navigating the transition to a GAI-integrated strategic management model, and the role of leaders will evolve with the advent of this new technology. This shift may require new', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='76c33047-2708-4245-8c45-2076d7e30ad6', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\\n\\n# Leadership\\n\\nApproaches to leadership that focus more on collaboration, agility, ethical and responsible use of GAI, and emotional intelligence to foster human–machine collaboration (Heukamp, 2020; Peifer et al., 2022).\\n\\nOne of the most important aspects of leadership is innovation, and GAI is particularly well-suited to assist leaders in creating value for the stakeholders. By assisting with the process of idea generation and brainstorming, GAI can assist leaders in identifying avenues through which the company can innovate new products and services that bring additional value to the company stakeholders, drawing upon knowledge and information far beyond that which would be accessible to individuals. This means that innovative idea generation will now no longer be dependent on a single visionary CEO or a small, highly experienced product development team, who are inherently limited in idea creation by the boundaries of their own knowledge or experience. This is not without downsides, however. Just as GAI can help a particular firm create value in this way, it can, at the same time, be providing the same information to other competing firms, resulting in an increased threat of substitutes, new entrants to the space, and a much more competitive environment. Over time, this can result in value co-destruction for the focal firm in the form of lost competitive advantages and increased spending on competitive warfare.\\n\\n# Operations\\n\\nThere is no doubt that the advent of GAI is already impacting HT operations in a meaningful way and will continue to do so in ways we cannot yet imagine as the technology continues to develop. Because GAI can perform expressive tasks and craft individualized interactions with guests, it is ideal for communication purposes (Brendlinger, 2023). GAI chatbots, for example, can analyze customer data to understand the context of each customer inquiry and use natural language processing (NLP) techniques (Athuraliya & Farook, 2018) to craft a personalized response, resulting in the creation of value for the customer, who receives an instant, personalized answer to the question or request.\\n\\nWhile such personalized recommendations and experiences create value for both the customer and the company, suggestions and experiences can also result in value co-destruction. Inherent in a personalized experience is the loss of the experimentation, exploration, and discovery that comes with trying new foods, traveling to offbeat places, and having experiences that force customers to stretch and grow outside of their comfort zone. Additionally, the information put forth by GAI can be incorrect, outdated, or biased, which can result in value co-destruction for both the firm and the customer in the form of bad experiences and guest complaints.\\n\\n# Marketing\\n\\nOne of the most impactful outcomes of GAI in the HT industry is expected to be hyper-personalization on the demand side (Guszkowski, 2023; Lalli, 2023; Mondal et al., 2023). GAI can help HT businesses create personalized marketing content at scale (and without extensive human involvement) to enhance booking experiences and marketing communication. As an example, hotels can use GAI to create personalized social media posts for their guests based on their preferences and past behavior. Such systems could analyze data such as the guest’s previous stays, dining preferences, and activities booked, and generate social media posts that exhibit relevant offers and experiences. Another example is the use of GAI to create personalized recommendations for customers. A GAI system can market personalized travel itineraries, accommodation options, and activities by analyzing data on a customer’s past purchases, search history, and preferences. This can help businesses create engaging and relevant advertising and social media content, increasing customer interest and engagement. As evidence, Haleem and colleagues (2022) note that marketers can enhance ROI by analyzing consumer data and understanding their genuine desires without wasting resources on unsuccessful advertising attempts.\\n\\nGAI can also be used to respond to comments on social media. Currently many companies only respond to a few selected comments simply because the human capital required to respond to every comment is cost-prohibitive. By using GAI to respond to customer or follower comments, the company will be able to increase consumer engagement on social media.\\n\\nGAI can be especially helpful in dealing with unfavorable online reviews. GAI can review the sentiments expressed in online reviews and respond in real-time. Additionally, these responses can be individualized, rather than using the one-size-fits-all responses that are so often seen in such circumstances. By creating personalized responses to negative online reviews, GAI can aid in service recovery, satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word of mouth.\\n\\nWhile these capabilities can certainly create value for both the company and the customer reading the reviews, there is a potential for value co-destruction as well. As online review sites become flooded with fake reviews that are generated by GAI, it may become impossible to trust any review at all. This may lead to the destruction of the familiar review and rating systems that exist currently, as they will no longer provide reliable information.\\n\\n# Destination Management\\n\\nGAI can be employed not only by individual companies, but also by destinations. At the travel decision level, GAI can add value to every stage of the trip from the anticipation and planning phase, to the trip to the site, the onsite experience, and the post-reflection phase of the trip. In the destination development stage, GAI can enable the development of more engaging, hyper-personalized tourism products, such as personalized travel guides based on individual preferences. For example, a', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='037032cf-a14f-42cb-babc-4429cf1a5f0e', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)\\n\\nTravel guide could generate an itinerary for a day in Paris, focusing on museums per the traveler’s request. This travel guide can also adapt in real-time to factors such as the traveler’s mood or weather conditions, adjusting the itinerary to include more outdoor activities if the weather is nice. In addition to inspiring travelers and developing customized trip plans at the pre-trip stage, GAI can be integrated to the destination experience by offering navigation routes based on interests and preferences of visitors during the trip stage. Hence, GAI has the potential to replace guides and even local people to assist people during their travel. However, this loss of autonomy in travel-related decision making could also negatively affect the tourist experience resulting in value co-destruction (Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021).\\n\\n# Human Resources and Talent Management\\n\\nStaff training and development is a key area ripe for the infusion of GAI. Science-based GAI training can empower associates to develop exactly the skills they are lacking, as GAI will be able to identify areas in which the associate needs help, create an individualized training program, provide real-time feedback, and make shifts to the training program based on each person’s progress and success. Training and development are key factors in employee retention, and GAI can assist with this important initiative by developing highly relevant, hyper-personalized training and associate development.\\n\\nGAI also has the potential to supplement human labor in the HT industry by reducing the need for humans to do repetitive and time-consuming tasks. This, in turn, can allow employees to focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, and customer interaction. While this could have positive effects in areas that struggle to hire and retain employees, particularly unskilled laborers, it does give rise to concerns over human employee displacement in many markets. While this is, of course, a concern in many segments of the economy, it is of particular concern in the HT industry, which is overwhelmingly comprised of unskilled workers and customer service employees. Thus, there exists the potential for value co-destruction from an employee perspective. However, GAI is also expected to create new jobs and tasks by transforming frontline service encounters and redefining HT jobs (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023).\\n\\n# Demand, Supply, and Revenue Management\\n\\nAs a data-driven field, much of what is done in revenue management depends on the accurate forecasting of customer demand (Cross et al., 2009; Roberts, 2022; Talluri & van Ryzin, 2006). The advent of more sophisticated GAI algorithms is likely to advance the ability of revenue managers to access the vast amount of historical and current data in real-time to better model demand and predict customer purchase behavior, even over longer time horizons. In addition to being able to make more accurate forecasts, GAI will also be able to make pricing suggestions based on how actual demand and supply are developing in real-time. This would mean that updates to the booking curve, forecast adjustments, and changes in inventory allocations will also be possible in real-time. These possibilities have the potential to create a great deal of value for the firm in the form of maximized profits.\\n\\nThus, GAI systems will most certainly (partly) replace current revenue management practices that rely largely on human insight and interference. This may lead to the co-destruction of the field of revenue management as we now know it, displacing employees and rendering certain skill sets irrelevant. Moreover, HT firms must consider potential consumer backlash and the impact of algorithmic pricing, in particular online price discrimination, on perceived CSR performance (J.-P. van der Rest et al., 2022), and may have to develop the ability to detect, prevent, and mitigate such value co-destruction.\\n\\n# Accounting and Finance\\n\\nGAI has the potential for value co-creation in the accounting and finance discipline in several different ways. First, GAI models have the capability to produce AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants that offer improved, authentic, and contextually appropriate responses in conversational finance. Consequently, the utilization of generative AI can greatly enhance the effectiveness and user satisfaction of financial conversational AI systems by delivering precise, captivating, and sophisticated interactions with users. This technology can be applied externally to facilitate customer conversations, as well as internally within departments, enabling tasks like advancing an invoice through the approval process, thereby co-creating value for the firm, employees, suppliers, and customers.\\n\\nSecond, thanks to its comprehension of human language patterns and its capacity to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, GAI can offer precise and comprehensive answers to users’ financial inquiries. These models can be trained on extensive datasets of financial knowledge, enabling them to provide appropriate information and address a wide array of financial questions accurately.\\n\\nOne important potential for value co-destruction in the accounting and finance sector is data confidentiality. While data breaches and information leakages are already commonplace, leaked data is often somewhat hard to access, as one must know where to look for or how to access this information. However, once such financial data is leaked to GAI, it is then instantly available, in a user-friendly format, to the entire world. The potential for value co-destruction for a firm and its stakeholders in such a scenario is of serious concern.\\n\\n# Architecture, Design, and Art\\n\\nGAI technology has the potential to provide opportunities for value co-creation for numerous stakeholders in the...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='038428ee-a7dc-4e8a-9130-40a83589c4e2', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\\n\\ndomain of hospitality architecture and design. For example, GAI technology includes complex machine-learning algorithms with the ability to translate text into high-resolution 3D renderings. This gives rise to the potential for groups of target guest segments to participate in the research and design of HT spaces in real-time. For example, if a hotel company is designing new guest rooms, target guest segments can provide designers with direct feedback about what they want, and the rooms can be visualized from thematic analyses of their texts and rendered in seconds. Participants can then see the room, request changes, and add to the design.\\n\\nAlso, with access to extensive material databases, GAI can propose suitable materials for various architectural elements in the hospitality sector. By considering factors like durability, aesthetics, maintenance requirements, and sustainability, GAI models can help designers and architects make informed choices in selecting appropriate materials for flooring, wall coverings, fixtures, and more. Similarly, GAI can make suggestions on such design aspects as lighting and acoustics. By analyzing room dimensions, layout, and materials, AI algorithms can simulate and generate recommendations for enhancing sound quality, reducing noise pollution, and ensuring optimal acoustic experiences for guests in areas such as lobbies, restaurants, and conference rooms. By considering factors like natural light availability, room function, mood, and energy efficiency goals, AI algorithms can propose lighting configurations, fixture types, and automation strategies to create visually appealing and functional environments.\\n\\nDespite these benefits, the use of GAI in hospitality design has the potential for value co-destruction, as well. Generative AI models are not infallible and can produce inaccurate or flawed outputs. If these errors are not detected, it could lead to faulty design decisions or suboptimal outcomes. Implementing GAI without appropriate validation and human oversight may result in design flaws or inefficient use of resources, negatively impacting stakeholders. Additionally, an over-reliance on the suggestions and designs of GAI may result in value destruction in terms of creativity. Generative AI models operate based on pre-existing data and patterns. While they can offer innovative suggestions, there is a risk that they may not consider certain unique or unconventional design ideas that could add value to a project. Relying solely on GAI recommendations might limit the exploration of groundbreaking concepts, stifling creativity and innovation.\\n\\n# The REFLECT Framework and HT Stakeholders\\n\\nAs is evident from the examples in the preceding section, there are myriad applications of GAI at the firm level, some of which lead to co-creation of value, and some that can contribute to value co-destruction. Importantly, these value dynamics depend on the stakeholder from whose perspective GAI applications are being assessed. Thus, while the applications of GAI across various functional domains open new and exciting avenues for HT firms, there are several mediating factors that firms must navigate and potentially calibrate to maximize the reciprocal co-creation of value by and for the firm and its stakeholders, and minimize or eliminate value co-destruction.\\n\\nTo capture the spirit of the thoughtfulness that these factors require of HT business leaders, we identify them via the acronym REFLECT, which represents the various considerations of GAI use by HT firms: Resource-Based View of GAI, Ethical, Financial, Legal, (Internal) Educational, (Organizational) Cultural, and Technological Infrastructure. Thus, we recommend that HT business leaders filter the implementation of GAI in their firms through the REFLECT lens to more effectively co-create reciprocal value in the system. We discuss these various mediating factors in the section below. (Note that the factors are not discussed in the same order as the acronym itself, so as to provide better flow and continuity for some connected ideas represented in the various factors). While the GAI applications discussed in the previous section emphasized how the technology can allow HT firms to co-create value, the REFLECT factors, to a large extent, caution against the value co-destruction possibilities of GAI.\\n\\n# Resource-Based View of GAI\\n\\nThe resource-based view of the firm posits that inter-firm competition is not an end state, but rather a dynamic process in which constant learning takes place on either side. A firm’s competitive advantage is determined by its internal resources, which can be strategically developed and exploited to achieve superior firm performance. These resources must be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and non-substitutable (J.-P. van der Rest & Roper, 2013). Such resources offer the firm a comparative advantage, allowing the company to produce goods and services that have either a higher value or a lower cost (or sometimes both) than those of its competitors. If managed appropriately, this comparative advantage in resources can translate into a competitive advantage for the firm in relation to their competitors. However, as the marketplace is in a constant state of flux, firms must constantly be monitoring their competitor’s performance, looking for clues about how the rival firm is acquiring, exploiting, and extracting value from resources in order to remain competitive. The focal firm learns from the actions of its competitor and then institutes new strategies to compete. At the same time, the rival firm is reciprocating this process and adjusting its own positioning. This inter-firm learning process is key to retaining market positioning and spurs innovation and forward growth for all concerned (J.-P. van der Rest & Roper, 2013). Over time, companies have spent millions of dollars and countless hours perfecting the systems and strategies through which they learn about their competitors. This may include things like data analytics, corporate espionage, and reverse engineering, to name just a few. However, because GAI is a', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='037a29a0-cf79-4244-8cad-aee3c5fa04f7', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research\\n\\nContinuous learning model and can make suggestions for strategies and actions based on the knowledge acquired, its advent may significantly impact the dynamic learning processes that take place. The form which this may take remains unclear, but one can foresee a situation in which Firm A is learning from Firm B, Firm B is learning from Firm A, and both are learning from GAI, but in different ways.\\n\\nHT as an industry is inherently labor-intensive, and firms that can develop GAI capabilities, defined as “the ability of a firm to select, orchestrate, and leverage its [G]AI-specific resources” (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021, p. 2), can achieve competitive gains. Thus, based on the work of Mikalef and Gupta (2021) in the context of AI more generally, we posit that developing GAI capabilities goes beyond using GAI techniques and technologies (i.e., applications) that are easily acquired in the market and are subject to replication. Moreover, the data—both inherent and firm-specific—underlying these technologies is insufficient to create GAI capability. “Organizations require a unique blend of physical, human, and organizational resources to create an [G]AI capability, which can deliver value by differentiating it from that of competitors” (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021, p. 1). Thus, beyond adopting the GAI applications highlighted in the previous section, HT firms must make long-term and strategic investments into GAI as an organizational capacity that fundamentally transforms how the firm is structured and how it operates. Berg and colleagues (2023) make a similar argument when they state that for organizations to capture value from GAI, they must develop specific complementary assets that are different from those required for other forms of (discriminative) AI capabilities. Another way that HT firms could leverage a GAI capability to boost value creation is to use it to enhance other existing resources and capabilities. For example, by optimizing its supply chain via GAI, a hotel firm like Motel 6 may be able to further build on its core value proposition (of low prices) by offering even lower prices based on lower costs of inventory.\\n\\n# Organizational Culture Considerations\\n\\nVarious studies have identified that an organization’s culture plays an important role in its adoption and use of AI (Behl et al., 2022; Dabbous et al., 2022) and, by extension, the development of its AI capability and organizational performance (Bley et al., 2022). According to Mikalef and Gupta (2021), “to unleash the value of [G]AI technologies, organizations must foster a culture of teamwork, collective goals, and shared resources” (p. 6). Individuals and teams across functional silos within HT firms must have a shared vision and foster a culture of open communication and collaboration, particularly as it pertains to the sharing of data that feeds GAI models. Thus, an organizational culture that cultivates a “sharing knowledge is power” environment versus a “knowledge is power” climate can more effectively leverage the knowledge management and deployment capabilities of the firm (Korzynski et al., 2023; Liebowitz, 2001), which, in turn, contribute to GAI capabilities. Relatedly, HT firms must look to build cross-functional teams that include data scientists, software developers, and subject matter experts from various departments to collaborate on AI projects and applications that co-create value for their stakeholders. This also necessitates a culture that embraces risk and places a premium on creativity and taking bold and radical actions (Berg et al., 2023), while placing an ethic of hospitality—and its associated value constellation of care, honesty, integrity, dignity, and respect for and towards its various stakeholders—as its guiding organizational principle (Mody, 2023). Thus, as offered by Mikalef and Gupta (2021), “developing an [G]AI orientation within the firm is a necessary precondition for successful deployments” (p. 14).\\n\\n# Legal Considerations\\n\\nWhile the increased use of personal information can lead to improved customer service recommendations and overall customer experience, it also leads to more regulation about the collection, storage, processing, and sharing of this information. GAI systems rely on vast amounts of data to function effectively. In the HT industry, this data often includes sensitive information such as personal details. For instance, chatbots handle travel plans, potentially including credit card information. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is crucial to ensuring compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws (Kuner, 2018). Consequently, HT organizations may find it difficult to comply with the increased regulation in data protection and privacy laws across borders. Some countries have more comprehensive data protection laws that restrict the use of AI and automated decision-making involving personal information. Other countries do not have a single comprehensive law regulating privacy and automated decision-making. The United States, for example, has a myriad of state laws that cover some aspects of data protection and privacy. The European Union (EU), on the other hand, has been much more proactive in creating consumer protection and privacy legislation, with the most comprehensive to date being the GDPR enacted in 2018.\\n\\nIn addition to legislation surrounding the protection of customer information held and used by companies, there are other GAI-specific regulations that are being drafted in the EU, China, and the United States. These regulations would require that companies developing GAI tools (such as the OpenAI platform that developed ChatGPT) meet strict requirements for the data used to train their algorithms (i.e., the input for GAI tools), including disclosing the use of copyrighted material. In this regard, the EU is mulling a tiered approach to regulating GAI, whereby, in addition to the makers of GAI models, one of the layers of regulation would be focused on “regulating relationships in the AI value chain.” Thus, it is likely that the users of GAI models,', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='18dd6cd1-7d5a-4726-b979-6c371a4c2595', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Dogru et al. - Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\\n\\nincluding HT organizations, may be required to have specific obligations to downstream stakeholders (customers, employees, etc.), including the need to explain how the model was trained, the use of copyrighted material, and the accuracy of the datasets from biases (Lomas, 2023). It would be legally incumbent upon HT organizations to ensure that the stakeholder data that serves as an additional input into the GAI models produces output that creates and does not destroy value. For example, if creating personalized marketing communications at scale, firms will need to ensure that the GAI model is sensitive to customers of various racial and gender backgrounds.\\n\\nIn addition, given the fact that GAI moves beyond predictive qualities and can act autonomously, it raises many interesting legal questions that may bring into consideration other non-GAI specific laws. One such question pertains to how we assign fault when a product that causes injury incorporates GAI. For example, who can a customer sue if they are “injured” by the hotel’s chatbot or GAI-based recommendation system? Or, if a customer is left stranded at the airport after a GAI tool handling a booking request makes a mistake and the reservation is not correctly completed? As such, injured individuals have begun to test the use of traditional legal theories, such as products liability. One can imagine a hypothetical case whereby a chatbot used by a restaurant to handle customer inquiries about ingredients, and, more specifically, about allergens, provides incorrect allergen information about a particular dish. A customer with a severe allergy to nuts relies on this information and eats the dish, resulting in an allergic reaction with significant damage. The customer files a lawsuit against the restaurant, alleging misrepresentation, negligence, and possibly products liability.\\n\\nWhile many of these questions have yet to be determined by the courts, they are important to consider for HT operators when deciding on whether to use GAI and what preventive measures should be in place to protect guests and other stakeholders and prevent or minimize value co-destruction (Glaser & Niebla, 2023). Moreover, as far as the customer is concerned, whether the issue has been caused by a GAI system or not, the buck stops with the operator. Thus, companies using GAI need policies to handle these issues and to be ready to take responsibility for any problems caused by their AI systems, whether these systems were developed in-house or leased from a third party. Failure to do so may result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer/stakeholder trust. A case involving Delta Airlines provides evidence of these issues. In 2019, the airline sued a vendor of GAI-based customer service technology, [24]7.ai, for a breach of passenger data. Allegedly, the vendor had a weak password for its systems, which allowed a hacker to access its code and subsequently scrape the names, addresses, and full credit card details of up to 825,000 Delta customers. Delta took all the necessary steps to take care of its customers, including notifying them promptly and paying for free credit monitoring products for affected passengers (O’Neill, 2019). However, the reputational damage caused to the airline, as reflected in negative PR and consumer class action lawsuits, goes beyond the legal issues pertaining to the use of the GAI technology itself and raises larger questions of accountability and legal liability. In this regard, as J. P. I. van der Rest and colleagues (2020) determined, in the context of personalized pricing practices, “we argue that not much is to be expected from the legal system, at least not in the short run” (p. 113), regarding GAI applications by HT firms and implementing minimum standards of behavior. HT firms can mitigate legal challenges by adopting a holistic value creation perspective—such as that offered by the REFLECT model—accounting for the needs and experiences of various stakeholders.\\n\\n# Ethical Considerations\\n\\nBeyond the legal aspects of the collection and use of customer (or stakeholder) data, there are important ethical considerations for HT firms that use GAI-based technology. The first issue pertains to privacy, which relates to the question “Who owns and controls the data, and how can it be used?” GAI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, such as browsing history, location data, and social media activity, to generate personalized recommendations or content. For example, AI-powered systems that collect and analyze customer data for creating personalized menus need to ensure that data are collected and used in a transparent, secure, and ethical manner, with clear consent and privacy measures in place. Are customers given the option to opt-out of their data being collected? Can they choose which components of their data they would like to share or how the data will be shared with third-party systems outside of the company collecting the data?\\n\\nAnother ethical consideration is the potential for GAI systems to perpetuate biases and stereotypes (N. T. Lee et al., 2019). The current GAI systems mostly rely on Western sources with less input from other parts of the world, and hence may lack the necessary diversity of race, gender, ethnicity, age, education, beliefs, and so on. If these systems are trained on biased data, or if their algorithms incorporate biased assumptions, they can produce content that reinforces existing stereotypes or discriminates against certain groups of people, particularly around race, gender, and ethnicity (Pazzanese, 2020). This can be particularly problematic in the HT industry, where such biases can lead to discriminatory practices in hiring, marketing, and customer service. For example, if a hotel’s AI system recommends spa treatments to female customers or golf courses primarily to male customers, or suggests types of cuisine only to customers from specific racial or ethnic backgrounds, it would reinforce harmful stereotypes and exclusionary practices or even perpetuate unhealthy eating practices. This would not only be unethical, but it would also damage the hotel’s reputation and lead to a loss of customers.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ee369370-b8cd-4ed4-ac8f-05ab86197d72', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research\\n\\nanalyzes a variety of resumes for recruitment at hotels or restaurants. However, there is an ethical risk that the trained data in ChatGPT may be biased and less prone to recommend historically discriminated groups to managers or more inclined to provide lower-paying jobs to underrepresented groups. This can perpetuate discrimination and inequality in the workplace, leading to a lack of diversity and a negative impact on employee morale and job satisfaction.\\n\\nIn this regard, Zhuo and colleagues (2023) evaluated ChatGPT with respect to four critical ethical considerations: bias, reliability, robustness, and toxicity. While these considerations were developed in the context of a specific GAI tool (ChatGPT), they can be extrapolated to the use of GAI more broadly, as a filter for the firm’s value creation efforts. In this context, Zhuo and colleagues (2023) argue that GAI models are trained on a vast amount of data, and thus any biases (implicit and explicit) within the data can provide unfair or discriminatory arguments or suggestions toward people from different cultures and/or those who use different languages, which can affect users’ perception of fairness and lead to a lack of inclusivity. It is important to highlight that the current GAI technology is based on existing databases, which might have limitations on diverse and inclusive perspectives in decision-making and communications (Dwivedi et al., 2023a). Hence, discrimination toward customers and employees may potentially be experienced due to this limitation.\\n\\nFurthermore, another crucial ethical concern associated with GAI is robustness, defined as “a model’s ability to maintain its performance when given input that is semantically (the meaning of input) or syntactically (the structure of input) different from the input it was trained on” (Zhuo et al., 2023, p. 3). As an example, ChatGPT can be used by international tourists as a language translator. In such cases, ChatGPT must accurately translate new sentences, although the language used is unfamiliar. For instance, if ChatGPT was trained in the formal French language, it should still be able to accurately translate informal “slang” sentences.\\n\\nZhuo and colleagues (2023) further postulate that reliability and toxicity is a critical ethical issue related to GAI. First, disseminating false, misleading, misconstrued, or outdated information can contribute to forming conspiracy theories that cause harm and lead to poor decision-making. Often, language models such as ChatGPT can even fabricate sources that do not actually exist. Thus, for example, ChatGPT can manipulate online reviews of hotels or restaurants or mass-create thousands of accounts with false identities. Second, the concern is those models can generate or comprehend harmful or offensive content while interacting with users. For instance, if the GAI used in applications such as customer service chatbots or voice assistants in hotel rooms is trained on datasets that contain racist, sexist, or pornographic content, it can lead to the generation of offensive and harmful communication when interacting with guests. Relatedly, users may attempt to “jailbreak” a GAI application into producing toxic content. For example, a guest could co-create a conversation that tricks the AI into using words or engaging in conversation involving racial slurs (Hachman, 2023) or outright lies (Carter, 2023), which may open the doors to legal consequences.\\n\\n# Financial Considerations\\n\\nThe use of GAI by HT companies will involve significant financial implications and considerations. Managers need to implement a rigorous cost-benefit analysis before adopting AI technologies, including GAI applications (Ivanov & Webster, 2018). In terms of direct costs, the use of third-party GAI is associated with monthly or annual subscription fees to access the application. These can range significantly—from a few tens of dollars per month to a few thousand per month, depending on the capabilities of the application, the requirements of the organization (and, relatedly, any specifications or modifications) and the competition on the GAI market. Some AI providers, such as ChatGPT give free access to their GAI application for a limited period or for a limited number of generated images/words/symbols. This freemium option allows users to get acquainted with and test the product before they subscribe to it, which decreases the perceived risk of purchase of the premium options. Other indirect costs relate to the investment needed to train the GAI application(s) with the company’s data to allow it to provide specific solutions to the company’s needs and to train employees to use the applications effectively.\\n\\nIn terms of benefits, GAI can improve the profitability of HT companies in several ways. First, it can save costs associated with purchasing photos from databases, text copywriting, and hiring professional actors to appear in ads and read text, among others. The integration of GAI (e.g., ChatGPT) into a chatbot can improve its efficiency in interacting with customers and decrease the need for human employees to intervene, thus reducing labor costs. Of course, the current level of development of GAI has not reached the point where it can deliver output with error-free quality. In fact, the generated output (text, photo, etc.) may be incorrect, not relevant, or not specific enough, thus sometimes requiring human intervention. However, the more human-like interactions with a GAI-based chatbot as compared to other chatbots may have a direct positive impact on revenue since the information provided by the application can be more relevant and personalized to the needs of potential customers (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023). Additionally, the speed of generating text and visuals, their quality and variety, allow HT managers to develop marketing communication campaigns that use versatile visuals and text, have more versions of ads that could appeal to and attract more customer segments and, hence, indirectly contribute to the company’s revenue.\\n\\nBeyond these functional and administrative applications, HT managers can also apply GAI in strategic decision-making that has implications for the financial health and performance of the firm (Korzynski et al., 2023). For example, HT', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='466e6810-0202-4f6f-b8bc-29b91dc16a3f', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\\n\\nManagers can leverage GAI capabilities to analyze competitor strategies, customer profiles, employee performance, financial statements, and other factors that impact business operations. These insights can then be used to make decisions on sales, staffing, inventory management, and other cost-related areas to improve overall business efficiency and profitability. Moreover, the ideas that GAI provides about new products, branding, promotion, pricing strategies, business models, and design may trigger the creativity and innovativeness of HT managers to improve the marketing and operational processes in their companies, their competitiveness, and thus improve revenue and profitability.\\n\\n# (Internal) Education Considerations\\n\\nIn 2018, nearly 8,000 Marriott workers across seven U.S. cities went on strike to raise their concerns about the implementation of various AI technologies that were perceived as threatening to their jobs; applications such as robots delivering room service, check-in kiosks with facial recognition technology, and smart speakers that serve as an in-room concierge (Durbin, 2018). Such reactions are consistent with research that has shown that AI disruption and job replacement threats cause anxiety and job insecurity (e.g., Lingmont & Alexiou, 2020). Furthermore, employees contemplate leaving the organization before their jobs are replaced by AI (Li et al., 2019). Relatedly, GAI might exacerbate employees’ concerns about the security of their jobs due to its ability to perform more tasks with increasing accuracy. In addition, GAI may disrupt the relationships between HT employees and their organizations by inadvertently harming employees’ well-being, leading to undesirable job-related outcomes such as cynicism, depression, and burnout. The risk of replacement by GAI, accompanied by negative work-related outcomes associated with the adoption of GAI, might trigger HT employees to sabotage these GAI-powered applications (e.g., chatbots) and the employer. For example, GAI can be used as a retaliatory tool in which employees could enter a misleading prompt, which, in turn, yields unreliable, harmful, and biased responses that eventually result in lost customers and harm to brand reputation. Likewise, HT employees can also shift the blame and responsibility to GAI when they deliberately engage in workplace misbehavior and a service failure occurs. Also, the use of GAI can result in ambiguity in the workplace. For instance, when a service failure is encountered or high-quality service is not delivered, it might be challenging to determine who is accountable: the employee or the GAI application.\\n\\nTo counter these negative outcomes, along with developing an organizational culture that enables GAI capability, a structured approach to educating internal stakeholders—particularly employees—is necessary to ensure that they are ready for the changes associated with GAI adoption and have a thorough understanding of the technology and its potential applications. The fear of the unknown is driven by a lack of understanding. This may be particularly true for the HT industry, where much work is still manual and labor-intensive in nature, and employees performing such work are often not fluent in technology and its use. Thus, firms must invest in training that starts by explaining what GAI is, how it differs from other types of artificial intelligence, and its current and anticipated applications in the particular HT setting. For example, housekeepers who may be worried about cleaning robots taking over their jobs can be assured that GAI is largely used to generate new content, such as images, text, and audio, and cannot be used to replace any of the tasks they perform.\\n\\nFor employees whose jobs may be impacted by GAI, such as concierges or customer service representatives responding to guest comments on TripAdvisor, it may be important to educate them on the fact that GAI can work hand in hand with human employees and handle repetitive and mundane tasks, enabling employees to focus on the more important and creative components of their jobs (Lee et al., 2023b). For instance, a GAI application could offer a first draft of a response to a negative guest feedback, and a human representative could vet, enhance, and further personalize the response, saving time and effort and providing a high-level recovery experience to the guest. For other employees whose jobs may be more significantly impacted by GAI, such as individuals in areas like marketing or customer experience and/or those working in more senior analytical roles, firms will have to provide the necessary resources for upskilling employees to achieve the desired synergistic culmination of human–machine competencies (Jaiswal et al., 2022). As highlighted by the Society for Human Resource Management, “if leaders don’t engage in an open dialogue with workers around GAI, then we’re just hoping they will understand, and a lot of them won’t, and those are the ones who will be left behind” (Folz, 2023). In addition, particularly for employees whose jobs will involve the use of GAI, they will need to be trained in the ethical implications of using GAI around the issues of bias, transparency, accuracy, accountability and data privacy, and security.\\n\\n# Technology Infrastructure Considerations\\n\\nA lack of technology infrastructure is one of the main barriers in adopting AI, including GAI, in organizations. Technology infrastructure refers not only to the hardware components associated with data storage, transfer, and processing/computing systems, but also to the softer infrastructure that includes the data itself (how it is generated and fed into the system), and the technical and business skills needed to effectively and efficiently implement and realize GAI algorithms (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). In this context, HT firms will have to ensure that it integrates with existing technology infrastructure, including operational platforms like property management systems for hotels, third-party systems like content management platforms for...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='60c88b68-2afa-4a3d-8aeb-f8ae5e8c1c63', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research\\n\\n# Discussion and Conclusions\\n\\nThe introduction of GAI as a dynamic organizational capability for HT firms is predicted to have a dramatic impact on the industry. GAI has potential to create value for HT stakeholders in a transformative manner through the integration of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies (Dwivedi et al., 2023a; Sandstrom & Dunn, 2014). Rapid advancements in GAI will likely bring disruptive changes to the HT industry and transform how the HT industry approaches operations, marketing, destination management, human resources, revenue management, accounting and finance, design, and other operational strategies (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023a).\\n\\nAs such, GAI can be a technological tool that creates value for HT stakeholders by enhancing guest experience with human interaction when it is most needed while allowing GAI technology to address the repetitive and otherwise mundane tasks, and employees to engage in more creative tasks, leading to a better work-life balance for HT employees. It has the potential to generate a higher level of personalized products and services, elevate the guest experience, and build loyalty. GAI enriches guest experiences, maximizes revenues, reduces cost, and increases profitability. It also provides shareholders with more transparent and accurate insights regarding an organization’s financial health, and may help keep associates in the HT workforce longer and attract a new generation of HT leaders.\\n\\nWhile effective GAI implementation leads to value co-creation, ineffective management of the GAI applications could lead to value co-destruction by and for HT stakeholders. An over-reliance on GAI might create a perception that GAI-produced content and solutions are always more reliable, which may destroy collaborative organizational culture and lead to a climate of higher psychological competition, creating a toxic work environment, causing disunity, harming employees’ well-being, and leading to undesirable job-related outcomes, such as cynicism, depression, and burnout. For customers, the extensive integration of GAI may lead to a loss of autonomy in decision-making and overburden them and reduce or eliminate human interactions that are essential to HT experiences, which may result in value co-destruction (Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021). Sensitive customer information may be at risk of unauthorized access, manipulation, or misuse, leading to privacy violations and potential loss of trust in service providers.\\n\\nThe use of GAI-produced content raises further concerns about intellectual property and copyright infringement, as well as the authenticity and credibility of information provided to customers. The creation of false or misleading content by GAI could lead to disappointment or even danger for consumers, possibly resulting in customers being stranded or experiencing a significant inconvenience due to reliance on inaccurate information generated by GAI. Furthermore, GAI-driven recommendations might reinforce stereotypes or marginalize certain groups, leading to biased or discriminatory outcomes, where HT firms could face grave, service, reputational, and legal consequences. However, by embracing the potential of GAI, while considering its limitations and ethical issues, HT firms can embrace this disruptive technology and offer a more creative, effective, and inclusive experience for customers, employees, managers, and other HT stakeholders (Lee et al., 2023a, 2023b). Devised according to the tenets of stakeholder theory, the REFLECT model offers a comprehensive and clear understanding of the dynamics of value co-creation and co-destruction via GAI implementation by HT firms, and provides a theoretical and practical roadmap for this exciting technology.\\n\\n# Theoretical and Research Implications\\n\\nWhile limited, several studies have discussed the applications and potential implications of GAI in the context of the HT industry, research, and education. However, while discussing the use of this technology is important, conceptualizing and analyzing its potential impact on stakeholders from a value perspective is more important. Additionally, the applications for the HT industry have been discussed in an ad hoc and disorganized manner, and the primary focus of the implications has been limited to research and education. Moreover, extant studies mainly emphasize the legal and ethical issues that might arise from GAI applications. In the present study, we go beyond discussing GAI applications for research and education and the potential legal and ethical impacts resulting from the use of GAI in HT contexts. We present a wide range of GAI applications for the HT industry and propose a conceptual framework that provides a comprehensive account of the GAI impacts on HT stakeholders. This framework integrates the resource-based view of GAI, ethical, financial, legal, (internal) education, (organizational) culture, and technology infrastructure (REFLECT) mechanisms and is based on the perspectives of 30 HT academics and practitioners with expertise in various HT domains. Consistent with the work of Freudenreich and colleagues (2020), the REFLECT model aims “to support theoretical and empirical analyses of value creation [via GAI] as well as the management and transformation of business models in line with corporate sustainability ambitions and stakeholder expectations” (p. 3).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='082d3ed9-b32f-4ddf-9cd5-1851d86d833c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\\n\\nOur proposed framework indicates that the application of GAI can result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value for a variety of stakeholders, and these effects can be mediated by the HT firm via calibration of the various REFLECT-based mechanisms. The reciprocal nature of the relationship between various HT stakeholders and GAI applications in the proposed integrative framework is portrayed by a feedback loop where the benefits of using GAI to facilitate value co-creation for some HT stakeholders might, in turn, lead to co-destruction of value for other stakeholders due to friction in these relationships. However, value co-destruction can be mitigated while value co-creation is enhanced by effective applications of GAI through the REFLECT factors. Furthermore, this integrative conceptual framework offers opportunities for future theoretical, methodological, and empirical research in the context of the nexus between GAI and HT stakeholders.\\n\\n# Practical Implications\\n\\nAlthough GAI is an exciting technological development, ultimately, HT is a people industry and will always involve people serving people. Utilizing GAI technology solutions, which work in tandem with consumers, employees, managers, and other HT stakeholders, is necessary to provide greater capabilities and to co-create value for HT stakeholders. Therefore, HT firms should navigate the applications of GAI through several mediating factors (i.e., REFLECT) to facilitate reciprocal value co-creation and to minimize or eliminate potential value co-destruction.\\n\\nHT firms should make long-term and strategic investment decisions when implementing GAI applications and leverage their GAI capability to improve other existing resources and capabilities (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). In so doing, HT firms can fundamentally transform their organizational capacity and how they are structured and operated. Furthermore, the insights generated by GAI applications can be used to make strategic sales, staffing, inventory management, supply chain management, and other cost-related decisions to increase overall business efficiency and profitability. Also, GAI should be utilized to generate new products and services, offer creative branding and promotion strategies, and to develop pricing strategies, business models, and design to advance operational activities, competitiveness, and revenues.\\n\\nHT leaders should shepherd careful integration of GAI in the workplace, considering the perception of employees. Implementation of GAI will likely eliminate some existing jobs and create new ones in the HT industry (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Iskender, 2023). It will also likely change the nature and requirements of other jobs. Accordingly, HT firms need to invest in reskilling and retraining programs to ensure continued employment opportunities in the changing work environment, which necessitates collaboration between humans and GAI. However, not all jobs will be affected or lost due to GAI applications. Therefore, HT firms need to train their respective employees and provide a sense of comfort and ensure job security in this context.\\n\\nGAI without the monitoring function could create an asymmetric risk for HT industry and might turn HT experiences into value co-destruction events for consumers, employees, firms, and other HT stakeholders. Therefore, HT organizations should explain to all stakeholders—internal and external—how their GAI models are trained, whether and how copyrighted materials are used, which consumer and employee data are fed into the GAI, and the extent to which datasets are accurate and free from biases (Lomas, 2023). Although many aspects of GAI applications in the context of liability and accountability have yet to be determined, HT firms should develop internal policies to protect their guests and other stakeholders from potential ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise due to use of GAI. In so doing, HT firms ensure that GAI models produce output that creates and captures (not destroys) value for HT stakeholders in reciprocal means while providing the necessary security and privacy protections.\\n\\n# Future Research Directions\\n\\nAs with any transformative technology, GAI also poses ethical, social, legal, and economic challenges that require careful consideration. Otherwise, premature implementation of GAI might lead to value-destruction for HT stakeholders. Therefore, many research questions remain to be answered to evaluate the efficacy of this technological tool in value creation for HT stakeholders. Accordingly, we postulated 50 research questions, some overarching, and some pertaining to the various components of our framework. The research questions were then rated by the 30 coauthors of this study on a 5-point importance scale ranging from “not at all important” to “extremely important.” Subsequently, each research question was categorized according to its primary focus: overarching, application-based, REFLECT-based, and stakeholder-based questions, and the questions were ranked within their respective category based on their level of importance according to survey results. Table 1 provides an account of these questions as rated by the authors of this research on a 5-point importance scale.\\n\\nAnswering these questions will shed light on the implications of the GAI for stakeholders in the HT domain including scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and policymakers. However, it is important to emphasize that the list of future research questions proposed in this study is by no means exhaustive, and many more research questions will continue to emerge as GAI technology makes further progress and its adoption increases.\\n\\nIn addition to the comprehensive list of research questions proposed above, further theoretical and empirical examination of the GAI technology will be necessary to contribute to our understanding of the theoretical, practical, policy, and...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='83dc97ed-1dd2-4c5e-81c8-8aa0a61ef23b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)\\n\\n# Table 1.

From a theoretical perspective, while we presented a comprehensive and integrative conceptual framework that explains the reciprocal value co-creation and value co-destruction process through the mediating REFLECT factors from a HT stakeholder perspective, future research is needed to examine each component of the REFLECT factors and its effect on the relationship between the application of GAI and HT stakeholders in greater detail. We also illustrated the reciprocal value co-creation and value co-destruction process with detailed examples. However, future research is necessary to delineate this reciprocal process in the context of each GAI application.\\n\\nFurthermore, the effects of GAI applications to the HT industry, consumers, employees, firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders should be further assessed utilizing alternative theories and conceptual frameworks. One such theory might be disruptive innovation theory (Christensen, 2013), where GAI might very well be considered as a disruptive innovation for the HT industry. The Technology Acceptance Model might be utilized to explain the implications of GAI and whether HT stakeholders would be willing to use GAI in the HT industry (Arici et al., 2023; Davis, 1986). In the context of GAI’s impact on employment, Leader-Member-Exchange theory might be appropriate to investigate GAI’s impact on employment issues. Alternatively, qualitative work may need to be conducted to conceptualize new theories to understand this new work dynamic that incorporates GAI applications.\\n\\nThe focus of GAI adoption should be on enhancing tourists’ well-being through tourism experiences, and communities’ quality of life through efficient tourism development (Uysal et al., 2020). Therefore, future research is necessary to investigate the extent to which widespread GAI adoption may affect quality of life.\\n\\nIn this study, much of our discussion was primarily focused on the short-term, immediate applications of GAI adoption. However, the extent to which GAI applications can contribute to the corporate social responsibility efforts of HT stakeholders requires further attention and investigation. GAI’s role in enhancing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in HT firms and beyond needs to be analyzed and discussed in future research. ESG and various sustainability, societal marketing, and corporate social responsibility issues demand a long-term view (Dogru et al., 2022). Therefore, the extent to which HT firms can utilize GAI as a practical tool to enhance long-term welfare and social good for customers and other stakeholders, is one of the most important avenues for future research.\\n\\nEmpirical investigations of the effects of GAI on the HT industry will shed more light on the practical and policy implications of GAI adoption. Utilizing stakeholder theory, disruptive innovation theory, Leader-Member-Exchange theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and so on, future studies should develop GAI-specific scales, operationalize the constructs, collect data, and empirically and extensively.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='20646ca8-d1c5-4ce8-a431-a78f1059a0b0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)\\n\\nAnalyze the effect of GAI on HT stakeholders. Specifically, future research is needed to investigate the value of GAI-enabled experiences and to examine whether an optimum level of GAI-enabled experience exists that provides a higher level of satisfaction for consumers, employees, and other stakeholders. Also, the effect of GAI applications might be different across different service segments in the HT domain. While GAI might be well perceived and needed in economy scale hotels or fast-food restaurants, luxury hotel guests and fine dining restaurant patrons might seek more human interaction. Indeed, luxury in the future could include the ability to interact with humans versus GAI only. As former Loews Hotels President and CEO Kinsell (2022) once stated, “Service comes from a manual; hospitality comes from the heart.” This noble expression provokes an important question in this new age: Can technology, like GAI, even without heartbeats, deliver heartfelt hospitality? This important question should be investigated in a comprehensive manner utilizing qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. Also, analyzing the problems that such adoption may cause to HT stakeholders will be necessary as companies start adopting GAI extensively in the HT industry.\\n\\nTo further explore the potential benefits of GAI for HT firms, future studies need to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of investing in the GAI ecosystem and to test whether GAI-related platforms help achieve better financial gains. Future research needs to delve into the economic aspects of the implementation of GAI in companies and assess the actual impacts of GAI on companies’ revenue, costs, productivity, and competitiveness. There are also risks associated with GAI, including data breaches, bias, discriminatory behavior, and the potential for decreased human interaction. Hence, the risk component of GAI can be evaluated in future research endeavors to see the best ways to mitigate these risks and create corresponding strategies. Although ethical and legal implications have been discussed in detail in this study, context-specific ethical and legal implications of GAI, such as privacy, security transparency, accountability, biases and stereotyping, and intellectual property rights, are the key areas to be analyzed further.\\n\\nGAI has important implications for HT research and education as well; however, for GAI initiatives to be successfully implemented in creating value for stakeholders, HT research and education institutions need to strategically integrate GAI as an aiding tool for research, teaching, and education, by developing clear policies and guidelines for scholars, educators, and students in utilizing GAI. Further research is necessary to investigate the implications of GAI for research and higher education in HT.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe leading four authors reviewed, sorted, aggregated, and interpreted the contribution of the 26 other authors, extended the content, developed the conceptual model, and revised the manuscript addressing the anonymous reviewers’ and editors’ feedback and comments.

The age of generative Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing business operations in organizations by augmenting and automating processes. This necessitates a rethinking of Business Process Management (BPM) as businesses strive to understand the behaviour of their information systems, and services. The proliferation of tools for analyzing process executions, system interactions, and system dependencies is evidence of this priority in medium and large enterprises [1], [2]. With the advent of generative AI, businesses can use AI augmentation to enhance their processes flows and make decisions based on context and user input.\\n\\nThe model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process generation using generative AI is changing many processes, improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows.\\n\\n# Index Terms\\n\\nBusiness Process Management, Generative AI, Generative Pre-trained Transformer, Knowledge-Intensive Processes, Data-Centric Processes\\n\\n1 https://github.com/features/copilot\\n\\n979-8-3503-0485-5/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE\\n\\nDOI 10.1109/ICWS60048.2023.00099\\n\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek.

Generative Pre-trained Transformer\\n\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art language model that utilizes deep neural networks to generate human-like text. The model was first introduced by OpenAI2 in 2018 and has since been updated with larger and more complex versions. GPT’s success in generating coherent and high-quality text has led to the development of other generative models that employ similar techniques. Examples include:\\n\\n- Text Generation: ChatGPT3 developed by OpenAI;\\n- Image Generation: DALL-E4 developed by OpenAI;\\n- Speech Generation: VALL-E5 developed by Microsoft;\\n- Code Generation: GitHub Copilot6 developed by GitHub7 and OpenAI.\\n\\nThe potential of generative AI extends beyond just generating new data, as it has the capability to revolutionise the processes in organizations and personal life by offering process augmentation, automation, and improvement. Generative AI has numerous applications, including the automation of content creation tasks such as writing articles, creating social media posts, and generating product descriptions. Additionally, it can be used to identify patterns and anomalies in financial transactions, help to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, or automatically inspect and evaluate the quality of products, reducing the need for manual inspection. Another benefit of generative AI is that it can automate customer service tasks, such as answering common queries and handling routine tasks, allowing human agents to focus on more complex issues.\\n\\n# B. Business Process Management\\n\\nBusiness Process Management (BPM) refers to the discipline of managing, modelling, analyzing, and improving business processes within an organization[1], [5]. Business processes are central to the operation of public and private enterprises. They involve activities that transform inputs into outputs, delivering value to customers and stakeholders. The success of an enterprise depends on how efficiently and effectively its processes are executed. For this reason, business process analytics has always been a key endeavour for companies[1], [6]. Early efforts to address this goal started with process automation, where workflow and other middleware technologies were used to reduce human involvement through better systems integration and automated execution of business logic. The total or partial automation of the process creates an unprecedented opportunity to gain visibility on process executions in the enterprise.\\n\\nIn addition to the techniques, frameworks, and methodologies mentioned for business process management, there is an increasing need to support knowledge workers in ad-hoc processes[7]. These workers require technologies such as GPT to help them offer new processes by maintaining process models in process silos using generative AI-enabled approaches. This is particularly important in scenarios where it is challenging for the knowledge worker to choose the best next step. With the help of these technologies, the focus of process thinking has expanded to include the creation and maintenance of process models that can adapt to changing business needs and support decision-making in real time. These advancements have further increased the importance of analyzing business process-related data to discover helpful information and achieve business objectives.\\n\\nIn our previous work[7], we introduced the design of AI-enabled business processes. A recent approach, Process-GAN[8], has been proposed to employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) for business process improvement (BPI). This approach assists process designers in creating innovative BPI concepts. Another approach, proposed by Mustansir et al.[9], used an NLP-based approach to extract redesign suggestions for automatic business process redesign.\\n\\n# C. Data-centric Processes\\n\\nAnalyzing process-related data is crucial in data-centric processes, which are gaining importance in medium and large enterprises. This data analysis helps enterprises to identify business needs, determine solutions to problems, and make informed decisions. Process data analytics has seen significant advancements in recent years, with research focusing on linking the insights gained from process data analytics to the process analysis phase. By analyzing data from various sources such as enterprise systems, sensor data, and social media, companies can gain insights into their processes and improve them for better performance. Examples of data-centric processes include supply chain management, fraud detection, and customer experience optimization. These practices and technologies provide process analytics from querying to analyzing process data, thus covering a broad spectrum of business process paradigms.\\n\\n# D. Knowledge-Intensive Processes\\n\\nKnowledge-intensive processes encompass operations that critically depend on the expertise of subject-matter experts, whose cognitive capabilities have been shaped by the acquisition and accumulation of knowledge and experience within their biological neural networks[10]. This source of knowledge can be used as the core of AI-enabled Processes, for example, to facilitate understanding the intentions of end-users better or providing a comprehensive method to retrieve useful information from the enterprise platform. In our previous work[11], we proposed the use of crowdsourcing services for mimicking the knowledge of domain experts in knowledge-intensive processes, and use this knowledge to build a new type of Knowledge Bases (namely Knowledge Base 4.0) that can facilitate the auto labelling of the data to be used in learning algorithms. The goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing from domain experts using rule-based crowdsourcing services.\\n\\nIn this paper, we take a step forward in introducing the concept of ProcessGPT. This model is specifically designed', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c6b8e610-12c5-4475-a1a9-1a0968e4d4a8', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='to cater to data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. It achieves this by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a vast amount of business process data and models. This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can also be integrated with natural language processing and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can be used to automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency, while also enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT has the potential to revolutionize business process management by offering a powerful tool for process automation, improvement, and decision-making.\\n\\n# II. PROCESS GPT: FROM AUGMENTATION TO AUTOMATION\\n\\nThe proposed architecture for ProcessGPT is depicted in Figure 1, which comprises several essential components such as the Process Data space, Process Data Lake, Process Knowledge Lake, Process Knowledge, Process Knowledge Graph, Transformer Model, and the Process Co-pilot.\\n\\nThe Process Data Space layer refers to all process-related data that is generated across multiple data islands, including process logs, process model silos, best practices, and process-related data that is generated across various data islands such as open, private, and social data. This data exhibits typical properties of big data, including wide physical distribution, diversity of formats, nonstandard data models, and independently managed and heterogeneous semantics. To manage this large and diverse process-related data, the Process Data Lake layer is proposed. This layer leverages our previous work, Data Lake as a Service [12], to organize, index, and query the big process data and metadata. The Process Data Lake layer will facilitate the effective organization of the process-related data and metadata to enable efficient retrieval, analysis, and sharing of knowledge across various data islands.\\n\\nAfter storing the raw data in the Process Data Lake, the next step is to transform this data into contextualized data and knowledge. This transformation is achieved using the Knowledge Lake as a Service approach, which has been developed in previous work [13]. To facilitate this transformation, the proposed approach involves the creation of a Process Knowledge Lake layer, which utilizes curation services to clean, integrate, and transform the raw data. Additionally, value is added to this data through the extraction, enrichment, and linking of information items. The contextualized data is pre-processed in the Knowledge Lake to form a large graph known as the Process Knowledge Graph. This graph is a representation of the relationships between the various entities in the process-related data, providing a more complete and holistic view of the process knowledge. The Process Knowledge Graph serves as a foundation for subsequent analyses, enabling effective decision-making and process improvement.\\n\\nThe Process Knowledge Graph is a large, semantically rich graph database that represents information and knowledge through a set of nodes and edges. The nodes in the graph represent entities or concepts, while the edges represent the relationships between these entities. The Process Knowledge Graph serves as a repository for contextualized process data, knowledge, tasks, and activities. The Knowledge Graph is a powerful tool for representing and organizing knowledge in a structured and interconnected manner. It enables the system to link related concepts and entities together, facilitating reasoning and inference across different domains. This interconnectedness between the various entities in the knowledge graph enables the system to reason about relationships and dependencies between different entities, enabling more effective decision-making and process improvement. The Knowledge Graph represents a significant advancement in process management and provides a foundation for developing intelligent and adaptive process management systems.\\n\\nThe Process Knowledge Graph does not include the best practices and knowledge of domain experts. To address this gap, our previous work [11] has been leveraged to mimic the knowledge of subject-matter experts using crowdsourcing services. This new knowledge is used to annotate the nodes and relationships in the Process Knowledge Graph, enhancing its completeness and accuracy. At this stage, the knowledge graph serves as a comprehensive source of data for the AI engine, specifically the ProcessGPT Transformer Model. The Transformer is a novel type of neural architecture that utilizes the attention mechanism to encode input data into robust features. ProcessGPT will use the Transformer-in-Transformer (TNT) [14] model that highlights the significance of attention within local patches for developing high-performing transformers. This model utilizes a similar approach to that used in generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), such as chatGPT and Github Co-pilot.\\n\\nFor example, chatGPT aims to suggest the best next keyword in the generated text. Github Co-pilot aims to suggest the best next line of code in the generated program. However, the goal of the ProcessGPT model is to suggest the best next step in the current process pipeline, leveraging the rich contextual information captured in the Process Knowledge Graph. In particular, integrating expert knowledge and the ProcessGPT Transformer Model enables more effective decision-making and process optimization, enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the process management system.\\n\\nThe architecture includes an essential component known as Process Co-pilot, which utilizes the latest advancements in Business Activity Monitoring [15]. The Process Co-pilot continuously monitors the activities in the current process instance, while simultaneously having access to the Knowledge Worker’s Persona and the Context Window, i.e., the number of previous tokens that are considered when generating the next token in the output sequence. It understands the Knowledge Worker’s objectives and requirements and sends a query to the Input Embeddings component, which is also fed by the Process Knowledge Graph.

Proposed Architecture for ProcessGPT.\\n\\nconverts the input data into a series of vectors that can be processed by the ProcessGPT transformer model. This model provides the best next step in the processing pipeline, which is suggested to the Knowledge Worker while dealing with the case. This scenario is similar to Github Co-pilot, which suggests the best next code to a programmer in real-time while they are writing the program. The integration of the Process Co-pilot, Knowledge Worker Persona, Context Window, Input Embeddings component, and ProcessGPT transformer model facilitates more efficient and effective process management, enhancing the performance of the system. The utilization of state-of-the-art technologies and techniques ensures that the system can adapt to the evolving needs and requirements of the process management domain.\\n\\nThe Feedback loop is a crucial step in the architecture. In cases where the Knowledge Worker is not satisfied with the suggested best next step, the Process Co-pilot detects this and sends the feedback (e.g., useful or not useful) to the generative AI Services component. This provides the generative AI component with access to a rich source of information and focuses on maintaining the Process Knowledge Graph by identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the generated content and ensuring that the model continues to produce high-quality output. By incorporating this feedback loop, the generative AI Service can continuously improve its performance and better support the knowledge worker in their tasks.\\n\\n# A. Process Augmentation\\n\\nGenerative AI has the potential to augment knowledge workers in knowledge-intensive processes and amplify their knowledge and skills to be more productive. One such example is the GitHub Copilot project, which uses generative AI to help software engineers write code more efficiently.\\n\\n734\\n\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek.

GitHub Copilot is based on the OpenAI Codex, a generative AI language model that has been trained on a large dataset of code. While GitHub Copilot is a great example of how generative AI can be used to augment knowledge workers in the software engineering domain, we believe that there is potential for similar technology in other data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes.\\n\\nOur vision is to utilize ProcessGPT for the creation of domain-specific Co-pilots catering to knowledge workers operating in diverse domains such as health, banking, and education. Accordingly, this paper proposes the utilization of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology to develop new process models in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be a revolutionary technology for process management by offering powerful support for process automation, improvement, and decision-making. For example, in the healthcare domain, ProcessGPT can aid doctors in diagnosing patients more efficiently by analyzing patient data and suggesting the most likely diagnosis and treatment options. Similarly, in the banking domain, ProcessGPT can be used to suggest new process/data models to identify potential cases of fraud or money laundering by analyzing transaction data and suggesting suspicious transactions for further investigation. In education, as another example, ProcessGPT can assist teachers in understanding and analyzing students’ creativity patterns and offer new methods to help students who need help.\\n\\n# B. Process Automation\\n\\nThe automation of business processes has become increasingly important in today’s fast-paced and competitive environment. Companies are looking for ways to improve their efficiency, reduce costs, and increase productivity. One promising approach is to use generative AI technology to automate business processes. ProcessGPT is designed to be a flexible and customizable tool that can be trained on large business process data and model datasets. The model can be fine-tuned on specific process domains, trained to generate process flows, and offer to automate structured and case-based business processes. By automating repetitive tasks and providing insights for process improvement, ProcessGPT can amplify the knowledge and skills of knowledge workers and enable them to focus on higher-level tasks. Furthermore, ProcessGPT can reduce errors and improve the quality of decision-making, leading to better outcomes for businesses and their customers.\\n\\n# III. PROCESS GPT FOR MAINTAINING DATA ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES: AN AUGMENTATION SCENARIO\\n\\nConsider a Bank as a large manufacturing company that relies heavily on its data ecosystem for its operations. The company has implemented various processes for data management, data analysis, and reporting. The processes involve several steps and can be quite complex. The company has hired a team of analysts to maintain these processes and ensure that they are running smoothly. One of the challenges that the analysts face is that the processes are constantly evolving, and they need to update the process models to reflect these changes. This can be a time-consuming and tedious task, as it involves analyzing large amounts of data and identifying the changes that need to be made.\\n\\nTo address this challenge, the bank has decided to implement ProcessGPT. The company trains a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data, including data from its own ecosystem and the subject-matter experts’ knowledge (captured in the Knowledge Base 4.0). The model learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data, which can be used to generate new process models. By using ProcessGPT, the bank is able to streamline its process maintenance tasks and reduce the time and effort required to update process models. This enables the analysts to focus on more strategic tasks and ensures that the company’s data ecosystem remains optimized for its operations.\\n\\n# IV. PROCESS GPT FOR AUTOMATING EXAM MARKING: AN AUTOMATION SCENARIO\\n\\nIn the education sector, evaluating student performance and providing formative feedback is critical for improving students’ learning and achievements. However, grading exams and assignments can be time-consuming, particularly in large-scale online learning environments. One potential solution to reduce instructors’ workload is the use of ProcessGPT to automate exam marking. In our recent work [19], we leveraged generative AI to automate assessment marking in the education domain. The benefits of automating exam marking using ProcessGPT are manifold. Firstly, it can save time and resources for educators, allowing them to focus on other critical tasks such as analyzing student performance data and developing personalized learning plans. Secondly, it can eliminate human bias and ensure that all students are graded fairly and accurately. Thirdly, it can provide immediate feedback to students, allowing them to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance in future exams.\\n\\nWith the growing use of technology in education, automating exam marking using ProcessGPT is a logical step towards enhancing the learning process. Moreover, the use of ProcessGPT for exam marking has the potential to significantly improve the quality and reliability of assessments in the education sector. By training ProcessGPT algorithms on a large dataset of previously graded exams, the system can learn how to identify and evaluate specific patterns in the answers, learn from instructors’ experience, and accurately and consistently grade exams with much faster turnaround times than human graders. Moreover, the use of ProcessGPT for exam marking can also detect plagiarism. By analyzing and comparing the answers provided by students in the same exam and previous exams, ProcessGPT algorithms can identify similarities that may indicate plagiarism. This is especially useful for large classes where it may be difficult for human graders to detect such cases. Furthermore, ProcessGPT can\\n\\n735\\n\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek. Downloaded on October 25,2023 at 12:57:13 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

This will ensure academic integrity and discourage cheating, providing a fairer and more transparent evaluation of student performance.\\n\\n# V. PROCESS GPT FOR WORKFLOWS: A HYBRID SCENARIO FOR BLENDING AUTOMATION AND AUGMENTATION\\n\\nIn the age of generative AI, the landscape of workﬂows is undergoing a signiﬁcant transformation. The emergence of advanced AI models, such as ProcessGPT, can revolutionise how we perceive, design, and utilize workﬂows. ProcessGPT paves the way for a transformative approach that seamlessly integrates automation and augmentation, redeﬁning the workﬂows of the future. This in turn has the potential to revolutionize how tasks are accomplished, offering a hybrid model that combines the efﬁciency of automation with the expertise of human knowledge workers. Let us explore a motivating scenario in a police investigation where ProcessGPT showcases its capabilities in supporting a hybrid mode. Law enforcement agencies operate within a complex web of processes, from evidence collection and suspect identiﬁcation to case management and legal proceedings. ProcessGPT has the potential to offer a transformative approach to these workﬂows, enabling automation and, at the same time, acting as a knowledgeable copilot for law enforcement professionals.\\n\\n# Automation\\n\\nLaw enforcement workﬂows encompass several crucial stages: data aggregation, evidence gathering, data analysis, suspect proﬁling, and decision-making. In the initial stages, investigators spend signiﬁcant time sifting through vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as crime databases, surveillance footage, and witness statements. ProcessGPT can automate this data aggregation, rapidly organizing and contextualizing the information, saving investigators valuable time and effort. For example, by automating the data aggregation process, ProcessGPT signiﬁcantly reduces the time and effort required for investigators to compile evidence. Investigators can focus on analyzing the extracted information and connecting the dots, rather than spending hours locating and gathering data. This automation expedites the investigation process and enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evidence collection. Furthermore, ProcessGPT’s ability to contextualize the gathered information adds value to workﬂow automation. It can analyze the relationships between different pieces of evidence, identify patterns, and highlight potential leads for further investigation.\\n\\n# Augmentation\\n\\nBy leveraging its comprehensive knowledge base and reasoning abilities, ProcessGPT can generate insightful questions and alternative investigative strategies and provide contextual guidance to investigators. This augmentation aspect helps investigators uncover hidden connections, identify patterns, and consider perspectives that might have been overlooked, enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Additionally, ProcessGPT’s ability to learn from successful investigation patterns, legal precedents, and evolving crime trends empowers it to improve its analytical skills continuously. This evolution ensures that ProcessGPT remains a reliable resource, guiding investigators through complex cases by suggesting relevant leads, recommending potential courses of action, and keeping them updated with the latest developments in the ﬁeld.\\n\\n# VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nIn this position paper, we proposed using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology to generate new processes to facilitate decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process-related data and models, and then fine-tuning it on specific process domains to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. Through the integration of natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the model can provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Additionally, the model can automate repetitive tasks, improve process efficiency, and enable knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings and make informed decisions.\\n\\nThe application of ProcessGPT in business process management can bring a transformative change. We are exploring the full potential of ProcessGPT in different domains, such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Additionally, a deep dive into the ethical and legal implications of ProcessGPT will be explored. Another line of research focuses on the scalability and sustainability of ProcessGPT to ensure its long-term viability as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workﬂows. In the following, we discuss a few future directions and ongoing works.\\n\\n# Understanding Conversations\\n\\nProcessGPT can beneﬁt from improved natural language understanding capabilities, allowing it to more accurately comprehend and interpret complex instructions, queries, and context. Advancements in this area would enable more precise and context-aware automation and augmentation. As an ongoing work, we are exploring various techniques such as semantic parsing, entity recognition, and coreference resolution to extract deeper meaning from conversations. Additionally, advancements in natural language understanding can be coupled with contextual reasoning and world knowledge integration to enhance ProcessGPT’s comprehension of speciﬁc domains.\\n\\n# Domain-Specific Knowledge\\n\\nProcessGPT can be further developed to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and expertise, making it more effective in supporting specialized workﬂows. By integrating specific industry knowledge, regulations, and best practices, ProcessGPT can provide tailored guidance and automation in various sectors such as healthcare, education, finance, and law enforcement.\\n\\n# Advanced Decision Support\\n\\nProcessGPT can evolve to offer advanced decision support by incorporating probabilistic reasoning, risk analysis, and predictive modelling. This would enable it to assist knowledge workers in complex decision-making processes, providing insights and recommendations based on sophisticated analysis of data and patterns.\\n\\n736\\n\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek.

This would allow ProcessGPT to analyze and interpret information from diverse sources, enriching its understanding and enhancing its ability to support complex workflows.\\n\\n# Collaborative Workflows\\n\\nFuture developments in ProcessGPT could focus on facilitating collaborative workflows, enabling seamless cooperation and interaction between human users and the AI system. This would involve real-time collaboration, shared decision-making, and synchronized task management, fostering a productive and synergistic partnership.\\n\\n# Ethical Considerations\\n\\nAs ProcessGPT continues to advance, ethical considerations become increasingly important. Future directions for ProcessGPT will prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability, ensuring that the system operates ethically and respects user privacy and data security.\\n\\n# Privacy-Preserving Techniques\\n\\nAs an ongoing work, we are considering developing privacy-preserving techniques to allow organizations to leverage the benefits of ProcessGPT while ensuring the protection of sensitive or confidential information. This could involve federated learning, differential privacy, and secure multi-party computation techniques.\\n\\n# Integration with Existing Systems\\n\\nAn important line of work will focus on researching techniques to seamlessly integrate ProcessGPT with existing software and systems used in organizations. This would facilitate smooth interoperability and enable ProcessGPT to leverage and enhance the capabilities of existing tools and platforms. This line of work will also involve studying user needs, preferences, and workflows to create a seamless and productive user experience that optimally combines human expertise with ProcessGPT’s automation and augmentation capabilities.\\n\\n# Continuous Learning and Improvement\\n\\nOne promising future direction is to focus on developing sophisticated feedback mechanisms that facilitate user interactions and knowledge exchange. By actively soliciting feedback from users, ProcessGPT can learn from their expertise and incorporate it into its decision-making processes. This feedback loop can involve techniques such as reinforcement learning, where the system learns through trial and error based on the outcomes of its actions, or active learning, which involves selecting informative data points to improve model performance. Moreover, exploring methods to leverage new data continuously is another crucial avenue of research.\\n\\n# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\n\\nWe acknowledge the Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, for funding this research.\\n\\n# REFERENCES\\n\\n1.

Companies are influenced by macro-level developments such as new environmental regulations and by meso-level context such as social industry standards and guidelines. At the same time, companies are expected to contribute to sustainability transformations of markets at the meso-level and to solving grand sustainability problems at the macro-level such as the greenhouse effect. These developments increase and change sustainability information needs of managers and management accounting. This paper provides a systematic literature review of how sustainability management accounting (SMA) addresses links with the organization’s contexts and contributions to sustainability transformations beyond organizational boundaries. The analysis questions the conventional assumption of an internal scope for SMA. It recognises this as a problematic constricting assumption in the literature and, instead, proposes a multi-level Context, Action-formation and Transformative contributions (CAT) framework for further development of SMA.\\n\\n# Funding information\\n\\nStiftung Nordakademie, Grant/Award Number: Sustainability Accounting 2020\\n\\n# INTRODUCTION\\n\\nInvolvement of the private corporate sector is vital if sustainable development is to be achieved (Atkinson, 2000). Managers need to consider sustainability in their decisions, and this requires support from accounting to raise awareness of desired and undesired environmental, social and economic impacts (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2018). Corporate sustainability management accounting (SMA) organizes the collection, analysis and communication of environmental, social and economic information for internal use by the organization’s managers. Nevertheless, scepticism about corporate sustainability management, accounting and reporting has been prominent in various publications influencing the research agenda, as some authors see sustainability concerns and solutions resting more at national and global levels than with businesses (Gray, 2010). Moreover, questions arise over the extent to which SMA considers sustainability at societal and planetary boundary levels (Gray, 2010; Linnenluecke & Smith, 2019; Rockström et al., 2009; Whiteman et al., 2013). To make progress with informed corporate sustainability management, SMA needs to support organizations in analysing and managing links with macro- and meso-level.\\n\\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. © 2022 The Authors.

These include, for example, clarification about how business is integrated in its environment, how it operates within the scope of planetary boundaries, and how it sources supplies without negative sustainability impacts in supply chains.\\n\\nEmergence of a number of global environmental, social and economic problems, ranging through climate change, water crises, gender equality, global poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic and policies such as the EU Green Deal, has led to greater concern about the lack of sustainability (Eckert & Kovalevska, 2021). It has brought pressure encouraging development of a more comprehensive, integrated approach to corporate sustainability management, supported by accounting and reporting (e.g., Linnenluecke et al., 2015; Whiteman et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a contemporary review and analysis of contexts and outcomes and the potential role of accounting for management to contribute to sustainable development beyond the organization’s boundaries is missing. In order to further develop a research agenda which supports the contribution of business to sustainable development, this review investigates how existing SMA research explicitly considers the connection with sustainability at different levels, leading to the following research question: How does SMA literature address links with meso- and macro-level contexts and outcomes beyond organizational boundaries?\\n\\nUnderpinned by a multi-level framework, this study makes the following contributions. First, it uncovers the extent to which SMA research has explicitly addressed links between the organization, macro-level (e.g., planetary ecological boundaries) and meso-level (e.g., sustainability transformation of supply chains). The review reveals a growing number of publications addressing macro- and meso-micro links. These highlight various aspects of the business environment in general, indicating that regulations, networks and ecological necessities, do or can influence the context for SMA (e.g., Qian et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019). Second, the review indicates few publications examine how SMA could be further developed to better inform management about macro- and meso-level contextual factors. Third, the review findings are problematised by challenging the underlying assumption that the scope of SMA needs to be internal to the organization. Revealing the core idea and purpose of sustainability management and accounting in general, this article proposes that SMA needs to enlarge its scope by considering influences on and impacts of the organization beyond its boundaries. In a business setting facing increasing sustainability problems, SMA can help managers to create contributions to sustainable development of markets, society and the natural environment. It can do this if it provides information to make explicit corporate influences of and impacts on meso- and macro-levels beyond organizational boundaries. Finally, to improve its purpose of supporting management in contributing to sustainable development, reorganization of SMA is proposed through a newly created CAT framework, linking Context, Action-formation and Transformative contributions.\\n\\nThe paper proceeds as follows: the next section distinguishes macro- and meso-level links with SMA and introduces a multi-level framework for analysing these links. The following two sections detail the systematic literature review method adopted and examine the findings from the review within the multi-level framework. The findings are then discussed and problematised in relation to the scope assumption of SMA adopted in the existing SMA multi-level literature, leading to the proposal of a new CAT framework to reorganize SMA. Finally, a short conclusion is presented.\\n\\n# ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR LINKING SMA WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS\\n\\n# SMA interacting with multiple analytical levels of sustainable development\\n\\nSustainable development is a vision of and for society (UN, 2015). As corporations are embedded in the social and natural environment, they are influenced by and have influence beyond organizational boundaries (Benn et al., 2014). Corporations are key actors able to increase or mitigate social and environmental impacts of mankind, having an impact on this vision (Schaltegger et al., 2017). Previous corporate SMA literature has analysed ways to address sustainability from a corporate perspective. These include reviews of methods (Christ & Burritt, 2015; Dienes et al., 2016), management areas (e.g., Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Vitolla et al., 2019), sustainability orientation (Matthews, 1997) and themes (Marrone et al., 2020). To extend these reviews and analyze the existing organizational SMA (micro) research to meso- and macro-levels of analysis, the paper adopts Coleman’s multi-level framework (1986), as refined by Hedström and Swedberg (1998).\\n\\nFour reasons lie behind the choice of this conceptual framework. First, the multi-level perspective (MLP) framework (Geels, 2002, 2011) has been widely applied in the transitions literature and provides valuable oversight of system level connections and dynamics. The multi-level approach of Hedström and Swedberg (1998) has informed entrepreneurship research, with its focus on social mechanisms, to explain both enabling influences on the micro- and micro-level impacts on other levels. The framework, therefore, complements the systems view of the MLP perspective by offering a novel analytical lens to analyze the SMA literature with regard to its enabling potential.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='4ac6f409-1c8f-4037-86a7-ab09657db696', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Framework for analysis of SMA links at multiple levels\\n\\nand to discuss how SMA at the micro-level is influenced by and can contribute to impacts at other levels. Second, the framework allows contributions from different research streams (i.e., accounting, management and sustainability) to be synthesised. Third, the framework requires analysis of the links between context and outcomes (Hedström & Wennberg, 2017). This complements recent dynamic analysis of SMA processes associated with the introduction and use of SMA within organizations (e.g., Burritt et al., 2019). Finally, the framework requires activities at multiple levels to be linked, which helps to provide a comprehensive understanding of SMA and its role in corporate sustainability and sustainable development at larger scales.\\n\\nAccording to Hedström and Swedberg (1998), interactions between the different levels of business and society can be analysed in terms of contextual influences, activities that occur at the micro-level, and transformational change fostered by organizations (see Figure 1). The dark arrows in Figure 1 display links connecting macro- and meso-levels with the organizational micro-level where SMA is located.\\n\\n# Situational mechanisms\\n\\n(arrow a1 and a2 in Figure 1) describe the contextual and institutional-based processes affecting beliefs, motivations and actions of managers, linking macro- and meso-level conditions to the micro-level of the company.\\n\\n# Transformational mechanisms\\n\\n(arrow b1 and b2) explain individual and collective processes of organizations influencing networks and associations at the meso-level, as well as regulations, consumption patterns, life-styles and ecological phenomena at the macro-level. Arrow ‘c’ (action-formation) in Figure 1 represents SMA practices that are adopted at the micro-level. Micro-level SMA activities often result from situational pressures acting on the organization leading to meso and macro transformational change.\\n\\n# Situational links influencing SMA\\n\\nBoth the macro- and the meso-levels provide a situational context in which organizational actors operate and where changes take place slowly over time (e.g., Hernes, 1998). Macro-micro links are characterised by situational mechanisms influencing SMA through context (arrow a1 in Figure 1). Macro-level concerns about unsustainability can, for example, be related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015), planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009), specific global environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect, or social and environmental government initiatives at the national or supra-national levels.\\n\\nMeso-micro links (arrow a2 in Figure 1) are characterised by situational social mechanisms that capture the influence of networks on corporate adoption of SMA. Various societal actors, such as international organizations (Greenhouse Gas Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Global Reporting Initiative), sustainability-oriented business networks (Carbon Disclosure Project), and professional accounting organizations (e.g., Sustainability Accounting Standards', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='3515aecb-0b40-4bdd-9948-21aa8b252f65', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\\n\\nBoard) propose approaches to monitor, measure, assess and report on corporate sustainability issues at the corporate level. This shapes the accounting and reporting context at the meso-level, having a substantial influence on the sustainability issues considered in corporate SMA (Nartey, 2018).\\n\\nAt the micro-level (arrow c ‘action-formation’ in Figure 1), entities apply, develop or refrain from using SMA. They mobilise resources and involve partners in the adoption and adaptation of information systems for sustainability (Melville, 2010; Seidel et al., 2013). The micro-level is also a key place where innovations emerge (Geels, 2002; Kemp et al., 2001; Smith & Raven, 2012). Organizations react to situational influences beyond organizational boundaries (Geels, 2010), including niche interactions with incumbents (Geels, 2019). As SMA requires new approaches and innovations different from conventional accounting, the micro-level is crucial for SMA research, experimentation and practice (e.g., Burritt et al., 2019), development of capabilities (Albertini, 2019) and competencies (Ascui & Lovell, 2012). New SMA approaches are developed through dedicated arrangements of actors, pioneering companies, external research projects and citizen’s initiatives. Where companies see sustainability as a means to obtain benefit, the situational context is important for SMA development, but not always essential if managers have a well-developed social conscience.\\n\\nAnalyzing situational links between the macro-, meso- and micro-levels helps with understanding why certain SMA approaches emerge and how companies react to the broader business context. The potential contribution of SMA to creating solutions to planetary environmental and social challenges requires investigation of the transformational outcomes at the meso- and macro-levels (Loorbach et al., 2010) that result from SMA activity and adoption.\\n\\n# Transformational links of SMA influence\\n\\nSustainability transformations involve multi-party participation at different levels, akin to a transdisciplinary approach (e.g., Lang et al., 2012) to setting strategic long-term goals (e.g., Loorbach et al., 2010), experimenting with different situations and tools, and linking the long-term aims of the different parties with pragmatic short-term actions to achieve these (Rotmans et al., 2001). If SMA is to be effective in supporting improved management decisions then processes which create impacts at the societal meso-level of markets and networks (transformational link b2) as well as at the macro-level (transformational link b1), should be initiated in the corporation at the micro-level.\\n\\nTransformational mechanisms linking the micro- and meso-levels of analysis address the influence of micro-level SMA development and use on networks, industry associations and markets at the meso-level. These links capture the influence of SMA adoption on establishing industry initiatives for SMA, sustainability-oriented industry associations, professional accounting organizations issuing reports on SMA, and sustainability awards (e.g., Hansen et al., 2010). Transformational links between micro-level development of innovative methods of SMA, with disseminating organizations at the meso-level, potentially play an important role in altering unsustainable practices and creating new, more sustainable professional and industry-based standards. These, in turn, can subsequently exert situational influence on the whole industry and economy towards sustainability.\\n\\nTransformational mechanisms linking micro- and macro-levels of analysis address the involvement of SMA effects on wider global societal and planetary ecological areas and governments, with sustainable development as the ultimate goal. This link addresses, for instance, the influence of pioneer companies on regional and government programs and regulations as well as the contribution of SMA information to macro-level sustainability accounts.\\n\\nFor SMA to contribute to creating sustainable development requires situational and transformational links, between the corporation and the meso- and macro-levels, be addressed. To structure analysis of how SMA literature has addressed these links, a multi-level framework is adopted.\\n\\n# RESEARCH METHOD\\n\\nBased on Tranfield et al. (2003), a systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant prior research (Breslin et al., 2019). The method has been applied in sustainability, management (e.g., Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Vitolla et al., 2019) and accounting (e.g., Hansen & Schaltegger, 2016; Lavia López & Hiebl, 2015) research. The literature is organized using the multi-level framework originally proposed by Coleman (1986) and refined by Hedström and Swedberg (1998). The analysis of existing literature problematises key assumptions SMA research has adopted from conventional management accounting. It proposes a new Context, Action, Transformation (CAT) framework for SMA research and practice and suggests a new assumption on scope be adopted in future SMA research.\\n\\n|Table 1: Agreed Search Strings|Table 1: Agreed Search Strings|Table 1: Agreed Search Strings|\\n|---|\\n|Group 1|Group 2|Search Strings|\\n|Environmental|Social|Sustainability Accounting|\\n\\nFive commonly used databases (EBSCO Host-Business Source Premier (BSP); JSTOR; ScienceDirect; Scopus and Web of Science) were selected as different databases can lead to different themes.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='aebfe9d5-c8fc-48cb-964d-b02f722e3a5f', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Search strings for the systematic review\\n\\n# Group 1: Terms referring to SMA\\n\\n|Carbon accounting|Sustainable cost management|\\n|---|---|\\n|Water accounting|Environmental cost management|\\n|Material flow accounting|Social cost management|\\n|Material flow cost accounting (MFCA)|Sustainability benchmarking|\\n|Biodiversity accounting|Environmental benchmarking|\\n|Social accounting|Sustainability budgeting|\\n|Environmental accounting|Environmental budgeting|\\n|Environmental management accounting|Social budgeting|\\n|Sustainability accounting|Sustainability key performance indicators|\\n|Sustainability management accounting|Environmental key performance indicators|\\n|Ecological accounting|Social key performance indicators|\\n|GHG accounting|Sustainability performance management|\\n|Greenhouse gas accounting|Environmental performance management|\\n|Energy accounting|Social performance management|\\n|Environmental management control|Sustainable product design indicators|\\n|Social management control|Environmental product design indicators|\\n|Sustainability management control|Social product design indicators|\\n|Sustainability control|Sustainability investment appraisal|\\n|Eco control|Environmental investment appraisal|\\n|Sustainability balanced scorecard|Social investment appraisal|\\n|Environmental balanced scorecard|Accounting for stakeholder|\\n|Social balanced scorecard|Accounting for human right|\\n|Sustainable decision-making|Accounting for modern slavery|\\n|Environmental decision-making| |\\n|Social decision-making| |\\n\\nNote: Each term in Group 1 is matched in turn with each term in Group 2 to capture combinations of terms in sustainability management accounting.\\n\\n(Meho & Yang, 2007). Table 2 shows the search yielded 5456 articles to the end of 2019. The final number of articles for analysis, after data cleaning (as described) and adjustments, was 62 high quality peer-reviewed journal articles.\\n\\nThe goal was to include reviewed articles that address multi-level linkages with SMA. In the analysis of title and abstract, articles which only mention SMA issues at the margin, such as those dealing with broader corporate social responsibility issues, external communication, reporting and disclosure of sustainability aspects, were excluded. Furthermore, with the focus on for-profit companies, articles were excluded that examine an entire economy, local or regional areas, governments, municipalities, non-profits and public sectors. Likewise, articles dealing with sustainability accounting from an engineering perspective focusing on technical analysis or on different forms of sustainability accounting for ecosystems, forests or other natural habitats, were excluded to ensure a clear focus for the study.\\n\\nIntercoder agreement on the exclusion criteria was assessed using the Krippendorff α (Krippendorff, 2013; Lombard et al., 2002) based on a SPSS macro by Hayes and Krippendorff (2007). All four authors reviewed 30 randomly chosen articles and rated whether they should be included in the sample based on the exclusion criteria given above.

Therefore, the exclusion criteria mentioned above were also applied when reading the articles in their entirety. In the full text review, two authors searched for links to the meso level and two authors for links to the macro level while also assuring that all articles explicitly dealt with SMA. To double-check these results, the teams then reversed their focus. It was found that many articles mention a link to the macro or meso level. However, most papers address these links as a side concern, or use them to set the scene in relation to the specific accounting issue examined. Therefore, differentiation was made between articles that solely mention a link and those that deal with a link in depth. Only the latter are included in the final sample, to which three articles were added as a result of expert recommendation. In the full text review, 259 articles were excluded that did fit the exclusion criteria or had no meso or macro link. Only papers that explicitly considered situational or transformational links to and from micro- to meso- and macro-levels of analysis and deal with SMA are included in the final sample and are listed by number in the Appendix.\\n\\nFinally, to conceptualise the analysis of the identified literature dealing with SMA links, a framework (see ‘Discussion’ below where the framework is proposed) was abductively developed in a continuous iteration between the data (the reviewed articles) and the theory that informed the analysis (multi-level perspective distinguishing social mechanisms).\\n\\n# FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE\\n\\nIn total, 62 research papers were identified as thoroughly and explicitly addressing links between corporate SMA and meso- and macro-levels. Overall, more of these papers deal with situational (53 articles) than with transformational links (23 articles) and more discuss SMA links with the meso-level (55 articles) than the macro-level (36 articles).\\n\\nIn relation to the multi-level framework, the set of articles addressing multiple links is analysed first for situational links and second for transformational links before a key underlying assumption behind all SMA literature is problematised.\\n\\n# Situational links influencing SMA practices\\n\\nThe systematic literature review serves first to identify situational influences linking macro- and meso-level.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7024a803-beec-4020-851f-838b43d8ed48', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Current Page\\n\\n14682370, 2022, 4, Downloaded from Wiley Online Library on [23/12/2024].

Situational links (arrows a1 and a2 in Figure 1) describe how external issues influence whether, what and how organizations take-up and develop SMA. Table 4 provides an overview of different topics that have been specifically addressed in the accounting literature and explanations as to how they link either macro- or meso-levels with SMA at the micro-level.\\n\\nAmong the situational links to SMA, in the publications analyzed (Table 3), meso-level influences (40 articles) are considered more than macro-level impacts (25 articles). This reflects the importance of stakeholder relationships with industry associations, professional accounting organizations and sustainable business networks for introducing and developing SMA in organizations (e.g., Ascui & Lovell, 2012; Rodrigue et al., 2013). For example, Burritt et al. (2019), while mentioning macro topics briefly in the introduction, emphasise meso-level influences when explaining why and how a company started to engage with SMA. With few exceptions (e.g., Hörisch et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2018) the literature, while developing tools, processes and accounting systems for use by management, assumes that the application of SMA will (somehow) contribute to sustainable development (e.g., Atkinson, 2000; Hansen et al., 2010; Jalaludin et al., 2011), leaving the issue of scope to later research.\\n\\nPublications at the macro-level informing situational mechanisms, which are discussed in the existing literature with regard to influencing SMA adoption and development in organizations, cover a wide range of single influencing factors, including regulations (e.g., carbon management accounting, to comply with the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) (e.g., Ascui & Lovell, 2012), ETS related standards on how companies should monitor, collect and report carbon emissions (Stechemesser & Günther, 2012), international agreements such as the Kyoto protocol and related national and supra-national regulations shaping the introduction and design of SMA with regard to carbon accounting (Bui & Fowler, 2019), direct stakeholders of a company (e.g., Mokhtar et al., 2016), accounting standards (e.g., Zou et al., 2019), international organizations (e.g., Burritt and Christ, 2017) and business associations, media and NGO pressure (e.g., Wang et al., 2019).\\n\\nTopics include the influence of global, large scale and national institutions on SMA. Most prominent are references to global ecological problems (Hartmann et al., 2013; Lee, 2012), planetary boundaries (e.g., Schaltegger, 2018), unmet societal needs (e.g., Bui & Fowler, 2019) as well as, more recently, the SDGs (Nartey, 2018). A large number of SMA publications (259) are framed adding just a few sentences on global environmental and social problems. Only 53 publications (e.g., Nartey, 2018; Scavone, 2006) analyze situational mechanisms in some depth. These papers examine whether and how scientific information about sustainability problems, national regulations (e.g., Bui & Fowler, 2019, on the link between European and New Zealand climate change policies and standards for corporate carbon accounting), supra-national agreements (like the EU ETS), SDGs, and others at the societal.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='18750e29-b6c5-468e-b66c-abbfe0963b4d', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\\n\\n# 487\\n\\n# T A B L E 4\\n\\n# Situational links between macro- and meso-levels with SMA at the organisational micro-level\\n\\n|Macro → micro|Explanations and related concepts|Prominent authors and examples|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Global ecological problems and unmet societal needs|Exceeding planetary boundaries and unfulfilled societal, non-market needs on a global, large scale regional or national scale such as contained in the SDGs, including poverty, hunger, quality education and gender inequality and concepts on planetary boundaries can influence the emergence and design of SMA approaches.|Planetary-boundary-oriented related EMA (Schaltegger, 2018).

An increasing number of human rights related reporting requirements and regulations (e.g., the UK Modern Slavery Act and the US Dodd-Frank Act) has been addressed, creating the necessity for SMA to deal with social problems at the macro-level. While human rights reports on the global situation encourage companies to consider human rights aspects with SMA (e.g., Christ et al., 2019; McPhail & Ferguson, 2016) research is still challenged to develop more concrete social management accounting and encompassing SMA methods at the corporate level.\\n\\nSituational mechanisms addressed in the existing literature linking the meso- and micro-level SMA adoption and development in organizations include the role of accounting standards facilitating conservation of the natural environment (e.g., Aladwan, 2018), professional accounting organizations promoting SMA (e.g., issuing guidelines, expert reports, opinion pieces) and business networks disseminating and supporting SMA knowledge (e.g., material flow cost accounting, Günther et al., 2015). For example, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has a framework and requests data on greenhouse gas emissions from companies, as published in CDP databases and reports (CDP, 2011). As the data is requested in a standardised format CDP influences corporate SMA at the micro-level and the way they collect, aggregate and report greenhouse gas information. CDP has a similar approach for water data influencing water management accounting at the micro-level (CDP, 2020; Christ & Burritt, 2017). Qian and Schaltegger (2017) provided empirical evidence that CDP disclosure requirements have led to improved corporate carbon management performance, and the influence of the GHG Protocol for accounting and reporting of greenhouse gases by corporations (GHG Protocol, 2004) on the adoption of.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ae04a048-6be5-4874-a632-7e162d3f361c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='14682370, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijmr.12288, Wiley Online Library on [23/12/2024].

Only a small number of publications have addressed transformational links between SMA and meso- (15) and macro- (11) levels (Table 3). The development of innovative SMA methods, however, can only create recognisable sustainability contributions in industries and markets if disseminating organizations at the meso-level help change existing unsustainable practices and create new, more sustainable professional and industry standards. Whether companies can become drivers of sustainability transformations of markets and society and of standard setting, and whether SMA can be a helpful approach in this context, needs to be assessed with regard to the effects of SMA on macro-level sustainability goals such as planetary boundaries (Schaltegger, 2018) and the SDGs (Bebbington & Unerman, 2018). Table 5 provides a summary of topics about transformational links, which have been explicitly addressed in the existing SMA literature.\\n\\nTransformational mechanisms connecting the micro-level of SMA involvement of organizations with the meso-level entails presenting SMA innovations with the aim of promoting SMA to create sustainability improvements for many actors (e.g., for involving stakeholders, see Hansen et al., 2010), of forming and supporting SMA networks (e.g., Rodrigue et al., 2013), of considering value-creating stakeholder partnerships in SMA (Mitchell et al., 2015), and of applying SMA with the goal of transforming markets and supply chains towards sustainable development (e.g., Koh et al., 2013; Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Schaltegger & Burritt, 2014; Spence & Rinaldi, 2014). The arguments examining use of SMA to help transform supply chains often reflects a relational view based on the importance of the supply chain to the social and environmental impacts of the business (e.g., Lee, 2012; Koh et al., 2013; Nakano & Hirao, 2011).\\n\\nA prominent example of the influence of micro-meso transformational mechanisms is the development and introduction of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) guideline and the ISO 14051 standard on material flow cost accounting fostered by an increasing number of companies adopting material flow cost accounting (MFCA) (Jasch, 2008). MFCA was developed at the micro-level in transdisciplinary projects between universities, companies and consulting organizations (Herzig et al., 2012; Jasch, 2008), eventually promoted by a UN Division for Sustainable Development (DSD) project (UN DSD, 2001) in a workbook on environmental management accounting (EMA) and feeding into an IFAC guideline on EMA, particularly MFCA (IFAC, 2005). Later, driven largely by Japanese academics in collaboration with companies, the ISO 14051 MFCA standard (meso-level) was developed (Nakajima et al. 2015). In Japan, the ISO standard 14051 was at a later stage even taken up at the macro-level by the government and federal ministries (Kokubu & Kitada, 2015).\\n\\nMicro-macro transformational mechanisms are notably underdeveloped in extant research. Mechanisms which are addressed in the existing accounting literature include fostering the transformation of micro institutions towards low carbon impact and sustainable development (Ascui & Lovell, 2012; Schaltegger & Csutora, 2012), supporting the creation of new regulations supporting the uptake of.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ca89ed5b-d56c-4d88-99eb-dfcb6e9ee177', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\\n\\n# Table 5\\n\\n# Transformational links between SMA at the organizational micro-level and macro- and meso-level contexts\\n\\n|Micro → meso|Explanations and related concepts|Prominent authors and examples|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Presenting SMA innovations and transforming markets and supply chains towards sustainable development|Correcting market failures and changing market sensitivity through new accounting approaches, including what is understood by ‘best accounting practice’.

It argues for extending the scope of SMA beyond the internal, to go beyond organizational boundaries, discusses implications of such a change and proposes a new CAT (context, action, transformation) framework to organize SMA in line with the proposed extended scope.\\n\\n# SMA Research Opportunities Addressing Situational Links\\n\\nThe emphasis on situational links in the existing literature can be seen as an indication of a reactive perspective, the introduction and adaptation of SMA under pressure from external influences. While reactive uptake of SMA could represent business practice (see Christ, 2014; Hartmann et al., 2013; Pondeville et al., 2013), it could also reflect what researchers expect from businesses. The results also indicate that research has adopted the assumption that SMA’s scope is internal to the organization. Overall, the SMA research addressing situational links discusses consequences for SMA to support internal company process improvements. With this internal focus, the existing SMA literature has not explicitly analyzed how SMA could be developed to link situational influences with contributions of the company towards solving sustainable development problems beyond the organization’s boundaries.\\n\\nFor example, in relation to the analysis of macro-micro links, current research does not investigate the role of government actions and the impact of government failure (Ekins et al., 2003) on SMA development. Government failure can range from maintaining the unsustainable status quo of political and societal contexts, to institutional voids (e.g., Doh et al., 2017). It includes bureaucracy failure, the politics of power and the focus on elections instead of solving sustainability problems. For SMA, government failure leads to accounting regulations which ensure that management is under-informed about sustainability crises (Maunders & Burritt, 1991). Although some authors mention government failure as a source of sustainability problems in their SMA-related articles (e.g., Milne & Grubnic, 2011; Nartey, 2018), the topic has not been analyzed in depth in relation to situational influences on SMA. Of recent interest is that government regulations, such as policies and regulations introducing a Circular Economy (e.g., EC, 2020a, 2020b), could be analyzed in relation to how moves towards a Circular Economy could help foster SMA.\\n\\nOnly a few publications have started to address links between SMA, the UN SDGs (e.g., Bebbington & Unerman, 2018) and other international agreements (e.g., Kyoto and Paris GHG protocol), although the macro-level can, and...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='feeee428-d1bc-46b6-a13a-dac2789e90f0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\\n\\nincreasingly does, require certain topics to be considered in SMA (e.g., the US Dodd-Frank Act or UK Modern Slavery Act with regard to human rights issues in supply chains; e.g., Silva & Schaltegger, 2019).\\n\\nAlso, not addressed in depth with regard to the uptake and design of SMA is the influence of macro-level accounts on the global state and deterioration of the natural environment (e.g., the WWF living planet report; WWF, 2018) as well as reports on key global social problems of humankind (e.g., Walk Free Foundation, 2018) shaping the understanding of managers, employees and stakeholders about whether and how their company operations and products relate to large-scale sustainability problems. Likewise, the influence of EU policy aiming to foster a circular economy has not been investigated in depth in the SMA literature although it shapes the macro business environment of companies operating in the EU in relation to material flows, waste streams, reuse and recycling (EC, 2020a, 2020b), and explicitly requires monitoring, tracking and tracing of material flows at the corporate micro-level.\\n\\nIn relation to meso-micro links market failure could also be investigated with regard to meso-micro link consequences for SMA. While international and national accounting institutions mostly neglect market failure and developing markets for renewable energy, new regulations such as emissions trading and carbon compensation, are creating additional needs and incentives for companies to consider SMA. Existing research mentions market developments such as a growing demand for carbon neutral products (Milne & Grubnic, 2011), but does not analyse how these situational influences could inform SMA to account for transformational sustainability contributions of products.\\n\\nWith the exception of Ascui and Lovell (2012), also not addressed is the influence of voluntary accounting standard setters on SMA. These include the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and accountancy professional bodies such as the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). In addition, research on links between the UN reports directly addressing SMA (UN DSD, 2001, 2002) as well as GRI and IR voluntary standards for external reporting and SMA have yet to be closely examined.\\n\\nAnother underexamined situational mechanism, linking meso- with micro-levels of SMA, is expectations and influences of societal stakeholders (Silva et al., 2019) and social movements as ‘purposive and collective attempts of a number of people to change societal institutions and structures’ (Sine & Lee, 2009, p. 123). Apart from recent social movements, such as the ‘Fridays for Future’ movement, various environmental and social networks have addressed partial aspects of SMA, like the Earth Day movement (www.earthday.org), the International Women’s Day and call to action (www.internationalwomensday.com), and the Ecological Footprint Network (www.footprintnetwork.org; Dao et al., 2018). As there is no in-depth discussion of such movements with regard to their influence on SMA future research could investigate how they constrain, enable and shape measures and themes used in corporate SMA practices.\\n\\n# SMA research opportunities addressing transformational links\\n\\nWhile the small amount of SMA multi-level research focuses on contextual regulations and guidelines, it is apparent that few studies require SMA to account for transformational sustainability contributions of companies.\\n\\nAt the micro-macro level, few publications address links between SMA and the impact on specific environmental outcomes beyond the organizational boundaries (e.g., Hörisch et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2018), and none of the identified SMA publications deal with how effective the application of SMA methods is in meeting social goals. For example, while the Science Based Target Initiative aims to establish direct links between corporate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming goals, with one exception (Faria & Labutong, 2019), the link between different SMA approaches and contributions to combatting global warming has not been analysed. Instead, the scope of SMA research is restricted to specific internal issues, such as energy and material flows (Dunuwila et al., 2018), health and safety (Jasch & Lavicka, 2006), water (Christ & Burritt, 2017), biodiversity (Siddiqui, 2013), waste (Fakoya & van der Poll, 2013) and their measurement to support different types of managers. While reducing material flows, saving water and avoiding waste are all seen in the analysed literature to make important contributions to reducing the environmental burden of corporations and their products, there is no guarantee that these activities necessarily or inevitably lead to sufficient improvement at the societal or ecosystem level.\\n\\nAt the micro-meso level, with regard to transformation, the small number of publications touching upon mechanisms linking SMA and the meso-level of analysis includes the connection of SMA with supply chains (e.g., Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Schaltegger & Burritt, 2014; Spence & Rinaldi, 2014). Arguments reflect a relational view based on importance of the supply chain to the social and environmental impacts of the business (e.g., Nakano & Hirao, 2011; Lee, 2012; Koh et al., 2013).

These articles could provide a basis for exploring the importance of SMA for stakeholders in transformational processes. The research would need to find SMA approaches that aim at creating sustainability improvements for many stakeholders. Apart from the challenge to create value for both companies and society, developing SMA would also have to discuss how creating improvements of two or more sustainability aspects could be achieved (e.g., combined biodiversity and poverty improvements pursued by different stakeholders).\\n\\n# SMA and Micro-Macro Links\\n\\nSMA and micro-macro links are hardly touched upon in the existing sample of publications, again presenting opportunities for future research, for example, SMA and gender equality and global poverty. As most of the research literature has focused on specific internal issues in the organization (e.g., material flows) other important impacts of the company or its products with regard to the grand picture of sustainable development as expressed in the UN SDGs or the planetary boundary concept may be missed.\\n\\nFinally, only three articles address both, the meso- and macro-situational and transformational levels of analysis. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of these articles reveals that the levels are addressed separately and that the interaction between transformative influences of SMA on the meso-level with possible subsequent influences on the macro-level has not been investigated.\\n\\n# Problematizing the Internal Scope Assumption of SMA\\n\\nManagement accounting by definition has internal organizational addressees. Furthermore, it has been based on the assumption that the purpose of management is to increase profits by optimizing organizational processes (e.g., innovation, production, logistics) and therefore has an internal scope (Horngren, 2004). Likewise, the review of SMA literature reveals an internal scope with an implicit separation of the recognition of external context from the development of internal SMA methods. It may appear paradoxical that publications mentioning links to meso- and macro-levels beyond the organizational boundaries imply that the scope of SMA should be on issues internal to the organization. Such an internal focus of SMA, however, can be explained by the adoption of the internal scope assumption of conventional management accounting.\\n\\nAs a result, only a few of the publications addressing multi-level issues (e.g., Gibassier & Alcouffe, 2018; Schaltegger, 2018) have explicitly considered that SMA should extend the accounting scope beyond organizational boundaries. With the shortage of research which looks beyond the assumed internal scope of SMA the issue needs to be problematised (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011). Results from the SMA literature contrast with strategic, sustainability-oriented management literature. This literature emphasises that companies are embedded in a business environment and should consider stakeholders, regulations and guidelines in their decisions, including internal management decisions (e.g., Antolín-López et al., 2016; Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017; Hörisch et al., 2014).\\n\\nThe existing SMA literature has so far invisibly adopted the assumption of an internal scope by focusing on optimizing company production processes, material and energy flows and investments. This implies the SMA focus is on helping to develop the organization towards its own sustainable development. However, as sustainable development is a normative societal vision, to help towards achieving this vision, SMA needs an enlarged scope that considers influences from and on the outside as well as impacts of the organization within its boundary (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2017; Schaltegger, 2018). Such an extension of the scope of SMA is also in line with the transformation necessities identified in the sustainability transition literature (Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013; Williams & Robinson, 2020).\\n\\nAs long as SMA continues to adopt the conventional management accounting assumption of an internal scope it reinforces the view that internal optimisations will suffice to meet external expectations about contributions towards sustainability. SMA based on the internal scope assumption of management accounting results in managers being ill-informed about sustainability relevant issues, with the effect that SMA does not support broader transformational change. If SMA is to contribute to the societal vision of sustainable development it should be designed with the purpose of supporting managers in creating external contributions of organizations to sustainable development of markets, society and the natural environment. The question of whether planned and achieved sustainability improvements are sufficient to achieve effective contributions to sustainable development at the global macro-level, therefore, needs to be brought into the focus of SMA.\\n\\nThe next section proposes a new assumption and goal for SMA that addresses the identified multi-level links between SMA and sustainable development for which the literature review has been a catalyst.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='123d3ff1-b463-46c0-a8a4-14892c3e6f43', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\\n\\n# 493\\n\\n# FIGURE 3\\n\\nCAT framework for SMA [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\\n\\n# CAT framework to organize SMA\\n\\nThe embeddedness of organizations in meso- and macro-level contexts as well as the inevitable influence of organizations on these levels requires management to be better informed with SMA about how situational topics and mechanisms can intrigue sustainability management of the business, and how the effectiveness of the organization’s contributions to sustainability transformations can be measured and communicated.\\n\\nTo conceptualise the analysis, a framework was abductively developed in a continuous iteration between the data (the reviewed articles) and the theory that informed the analysis from a multilevel perspective. Based on analysis of the existing literature, and by referring to the social mechanisms framework that distinguishes situational (context), action-formation and transformational mechanisms, a CAT (context, action, transformation) framework to reorganize SMA is proposed as follows:\\n\\n1. Context: Performance is achievement in relation to certain expectations or goals. Managing performance therefore requires being informed about external requirements and expectations. To contribute to sustainable development first requires an understanding of scientific and societal requirements from the macro-level of analysis (e.g., planetary boundaries) as well as stakeholder expectations expressed in regulations, guidelines and standards at the meso-level (left side of Figure 3). As sustainability is a complex, multifaceted vision with many different goals a structured account is needed.\\n2. Action: SMA for the company’s actions is what current research literature has mostly focused on. The key question to be answered by SMA for management actions includes what social and environmental activities are conducted with what immediate economic (e.g., costs of investment in energy saving devices), social (e.g., safety improvement at working place) and environmental implications (e.g., energy savings achieved and carbon emissions reduced)?', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='5d9f9843-812e-45e8-8913-07af08d1d121', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='14682370, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijmr.12288, Wiley Online Library on [23/12/2024].

While internal actions in the organization have been the main focus of most SMA methods so far, the existing approaches have considered context with regard to the expectations of the own actions only partially. Implementation of material flow cost accounting in line with the ISO 14051 standard (Kokubu & Kitada, 2015), or developing carbon accounting with regard to regulatory requirements of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, have been investigated (Ascui & Lovell, 2012). Explicit links to whether planetary boundary conditions or UN SDGs are considered (e.g., in MFCA) and what consequences need to be drawn for benchmarking, goal setting, etc. has only more recently been addressed as a requirement and needs further development of SMA with regard to creating contributions to sustainability transformations beyond organizational boundaries.\\n\\n# c. Transformation\\n\\nThe assumption that internal improvements in an organization will invariably lead to sustainability, has been questioned in the existing literature (Gray, 2010), but it has not informed research into how SMA could be further developed to ensure effective sustainability contributions beyond the organization. Whether and to what extent the company contributes to societal and scientifically developed environmental goals is, however, crucial information managers need to develop a sustainable business (Hörisch et al., 2014). SMA is therefore challenged to create information to answer the key transformational question, how does the company contribute to sustainable development beyond its organizational boundaries; that is, a sustainable development of supply chains, markets, society and the natural environment? Sustainable entrepreneurship literature suggests that organizations can contribute to sustainable development (Sheperd and Patzelt, 2011) and further sustainability research has frequently called managers to think about such effects of their activities on the macro- and meso- levels (Johnson & Schaltegger, 2020). SMA needs to be linked as explicitly as possible to key sustainability concepts such as planetary boundaries and the SDGs which relate to social, economic and ecological conditions beyond the confines of the organization. To assess whether the business contributes sufficiently to sustainable development therefore requires measurement and disclosure of the negative and positive sustainability impacts and contributions of the organization to networks (guideline development, standards development), markets (sustainability change of markets and consumption patterns), society (change of life styles) and the natural environment.\\n\\nThe CAT framework has various intended methodological implications for SMA, including: the necessity for backcasting from macro-level sustainability problems for benchmarking purposes in SMA; a focus on management guidance, integrating different sustainability issues to ensure comprehensive contributions to sustainable development; and moving from ex post-tracking to future-oriented action and transformation:\\n\\n# Backcasting to develop benchmarks\\n\\nBackcasting rather than forecasting has been proposed in the sustainability science literature (Holmberg & Robèrt, 2000) to create a database and goals with regard to achieving sustainable development. Backcasting aims to calculate the necessary reductions at a global scale to stay in the limits of a 2-degree Celsius increase to global climate, and it can be broken down for industries and individual companies (e.g., Schaltegger et al., 2017). This shows the amount of greenhouse gas emissions an individual company must reduce to be in line with an economy operating within planetary boundaries. Such alignment of sustainability accounting and benchmarking with macro-level planetary boundary targets serves to establish micro-macro-level transformational mechanisms, which may help managers to set and achieve the goal to transform the own company to be in line with planetary boundaries. With regard to planetary boundaries, the Science Based Target Initiative (https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) provides a novel approach providing macro-level benchmarks establishing a link between SMA and the 1.5-degree Celsius goals of the Paris agreement to combat climate and to create meaningful informational value for manager.\\n\\n# Management guidance in addition to transparency\\n\\nCreating transparency has been highlighted in the existing literature as a key goal for social, environmental and sustainability accounting (e.g., Gray 1992). Much of the literature has also addressed reporting as an important aspect of sustainability accounting (e.g., Adams, 2008; Antonini & Larrinaga, 2017; de Villiers & Sharma, 2020). However, while transparency certainly has its value to inform management and stakeholders, to create awareness about problems, challenges and changes (whether improvements or deteriorations), transparency alone does not lead to management actions and sustainability transformations. As the Volkswagen ‘diesel gate’ case has shown, excellent reporting practices (e.g., Isenmann et al., 2007) are neither sufficient to motivate nor to guide managers to create excellent environmental and social performance with regard to the grand sustainability challenges relating to planetary boundaries and the SDGs. In spite of that, empirical research shows that, on average, improved disclosure quality leads to improved environmental performance of large companies (Qian & Schaltegger, 2017). Sustainability accounting that supports management to', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c8f4f00c-83e4-47e0-96ff-33135c3cc834', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\\n\\nmake better decisions with regard to sustainability needs to provide guidance with regard to macro-level sustainability challenges. This research suggests to investigate whether a new type of report – a ’Corporate Sustainability Transformation Statement’ could provide more guidance to managers to bridge the gap from SMA at the organizational micro-level to meso- and macro-levels. Recent global warming literature has touched on such an approach at the facilities level for companies operating in Australia (Australian Government, 2020), but such an approach has not been proposed for the corporate level, so far. Such a sustainability transformation statement could foster SMA projections with regard to meso- and macro-level action and transformational aims, and would also involve audit and assurance for such a new statement.\\n\\nIntegrating different sustainability issues to develop comprehensive contributions to sustainable development. Integrating social, environmental and economic perspectives remains somewhat abstract and insufficiently tangible for most managers in corporate practice. Furthermore, material flow management and accounting still does not provide information about whether the improvements achieved create trade-offs between different global sustainability goals. For example, the reduction of greenhouse gases by means of planting trees (Bastin et al., 2019) may contribute to combatting climate change and may be achieved in a socially and economically beneficial way. However, the means chosen to achieve this climate-related goal could potentially impact another planetary boundary: biodiversity (Veldman et al., 2019). From an overarching sustainability perspective, integration thus has a new meaning beyond the ‘environmental-social-economic’. Sustainability accounting research and practice is challenged to develop approaches to measure and assess crossing and side-effects between different SDGs as well as between different planetary boundaries.\\n\\nMoving from ex post-tracking to future-oriented action and transformation. Social and environmental accounting and reporting largely focus on the provision of past data to external parties, but communication in this way does not lead to action per se. While SMA, as with all management accounting, has so far focused on accounting using past and contemporary data to assist managers with decision making, taking actions leading to transformations towards sustainability would necessarily be concerned with data about the future.\\n\\nThis analysis of the existing SMA literature also has implications for research beyond the accounting discipline. Analyses on how well SMA supports managers and organizations to create effective sustainability contributions also becomes important for research on sustainable entrepreneurship (which assumes that social and green entrepreneurs can contribute to sustainability transformations of markets and sustainable development of society; e.g., Hockerts & Wüstenhagen, 2010). Only if entrepreneurs contribute effectively to meso- and macro-level transformations the promises of sustainable entrepreneurship hold true.\\n\\nFor innovation management, questions of fostering SMA dissemination in organizations to translate context changes into organizational processes and structures and to understand how situational mechanisms and related management actions help transforming organizations may be of particular interest. Silva et al. (2019) suggest to involve stakeholders in the assessment of sustainability performance to overcome the situation that most practitioners find the sustainability assessment and measurement approaches proposed in the research literature of little practical value and therefore do not apply them in practice. This raises the question how SMA could be further developed as an approach that involves stakeholders in assessing context factors and in contributing to sustainability transformations.\\n\\nPolicy and governance research could examine the effectiveness of different macro- and meso-level contexts and situational mechanisms on SMA introduction and adoption. For the last decade, various publications in the general corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility domain have addressed the political role of companies and how companies can try to motivate business associations, influence regulations (Marques, 2017). The purpose of corporate political activities is to influence or create the future situational context through legislation for other companies to adopt a certain sustainability approach or issue as well. The accounting literature, however, has not dealt in depth with how SMA could contribute to the political role of companies in fostering sustainability transformations of professional accounting and business associations, markets or regulations.\\n\\n# CONCLUSION\\n\\nSMA research has large development potential, both with regard to methods as well as dissemination. Analysis of the existing research literature on SMA suggests that innovation potential could be unleashed by reframing the role of SMA based on an extended scope that explicitly addresses context and transformational contributions, and links them with the organization’s activities as proposed with the CAT framework.\\n\\nMost social, environmental and sustainability accounting publications are focused only on the organizational level. While this focus is understandable, it has been criticised for many years as being too narrow (Marland et al., 2015; Milne, 1996; Stechemesser & Günther, 2012).

Introduction\\n\\nIn corporate practice, reference points to assess an organization’s sustainability performance are either past emission levels, own reduction goals, the industry average or best practices (Bradley et al., 2013). Such information, however, does not tell us anything about whether the respective reductions are sufficient to achieve SDGs or be in line with an economy operating in the safe space of planetary boundaries. Corporate sustainability includes contributing to sustainability transformations not just of the organization but also of markets at the meso-level and sustainability transformations of society at the macro-level (Patterson et al., 2017). Until now, practically no methods have been proposed as to how to broaden the management accounting scope including linkages to the meso- and macro-level in an effective way, which would be meaningful for company managers with regard to their job duties at the organizational level and create effective contributions to sustainability transitions beyond organizational boundaries. Accounting research is therefore challenged to develop innovations that enable SMA to translate situational influences on the organization and its management accounting to transformational contributions that support sustainable development.\\n\\n# 2. Implications of the CAT Framework\\n\\nThe intended implications of the CAT framework for SMA include the necessity for backcasting from macro-level sustainability problems for benchmarking purposes in the organization with SMA to explicitly consider the organization’s embedding in society and the natural environment. In addition, the implications include the need to integrate different sustainability issues to ensure comprehensive contributions to sustainable development, and moving from ex post-tracking to future-oriented action with the framework’s focus on management guidance towards creating effective contributions to sustainability transformations.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAdams, C.A.

However, this promising innovation is met with a scholarly discourse grappling with an interplay between the promising capabilities and potential drawbacks. This conversation frequently includes dystopian forecasts of mass unemployment and detrimental repercussions concerning academic research integrity. Despite the current hype, existing research exploring the intersection between AI and the logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM) sector remains limited. Therefore, this editorial seeks to fill this void, synthesizing the potential applications of AI within the L&SCM domain alongside an analysis of the implementation challenges. In doing so, we propose a robust research framework as a primer and roadmap for future research. This will give researchers and organizations comprehensive insights and strategies to navigate the complex yet promising landscape of AI integration within the L&SCM domain.\\n\\nGenerative artificial intelligence (hereafter referred to as AI) is high on the Gartner hype cycle concerning logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM)-related technologies. Various AI manifestations, including robotic process automation (e.g., collaborative robots or “cobots”), techniques in computer vision, speech recognition, machine and deep learning, and natural language processing, have opened new pathways to efficiently and effectively manage complex decision making and operations (Pessot et al., 2023). Figure 1 illustrates the capabilities of existing AI applications in the business ecosystem. These cutting-edge resources can potentially develop dynamic capabilities, enabling organizations to reinvent structures, flex policies, innovate processes, and offer novel improvisations toward value creation (Richey et al., 2022). L&SCM managers now hope for exceptionally rapid data- and objective decision making (Brau et al., 2023).\\n\\nHowever, we have all experienced this hype before, haven't we? Only a few years ago, stock prices were exploding at (soon to be) overvalued corporations claiming significant investments in blockchain technology (Gligor et al., 2022; Treiblmaier & Garaus, 2023; Treiblmaier & Rejeb, 2023). Hype-laden speculation is common in L&SCM practice and research because technology is vital to moving goods, information, finances, and people. Nevertheless, AI feels different from previous technological advancements. AI has already demonstrated varying degrees of success. Individuals—like editors—are taking immediate notice of AI's ability to accumulate “plausible” written text (Boston Consulting Group, 2023). Robots show remarkable dexterity, causing the uninitiated to reflect on some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies. All humor aside, our research question at the Journal of Business Logistics (JBL) should center on what, when, how, and why AI truly adds value. Still, AI presents a paradox as it reduces human involvement in simplifying tasks while simultaneously burdening humans with new decision-making responsibilities arising from the information it generates. Generative AI refers to integrating machine learning models to fabricate novel content. This encompasses text, audio, video, imagery, software code, and simulations based on large datasets that train the generative model (Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). This subset of AI technologies includes algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) techniques (Budhwar et al., 2023; Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). The output quality hinges on the quality of its input, considering both the training data and the prompts provided by users to define the desired task. The authenticity of responses from generative AI models such as GPT4 is constrained, given that these algorithms are “opaque” in their methodology, not illuminating how the responses were generated. There is concern about these algorithms generating spurious information, euphemistically termed “hallucinations,” and stoking considerable concerns regarding trustworthiness. This carries significant ethical and reputational risks for supply chain planning.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='755e6af1-608b-493b-9c44-07023c592fb8', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L\\n\\n# Insufficient data\\n\\n# Simulating scenarios to evaluate potential maximum solution.\\n\\nE.g., cyber security assessment\\n\\n# Supervised\\n\\nUsing AI generated machine learning insights for innovation\\n\\nE.g., service innovation\\n\\n# Supervised and Rule-based system\\n\\nE.g., online chatbots for answering customer queries.\\n\\n# Natural language processing and Speech recognition\\n\\nE.g., predictive maintenance of machines\\n\\n# Automated decision-making.\\n\\nE.g., cobots.\\n\\n# Deep learning\\n\\nVision Processing and Deep learning\\n\\n# Context-known.\\n\\n# Context-unknown.\\n\\n# F I G U R E ¡ 1 ¡  AI capabilities in existing business applications.\\n\\nlost $100 billion in shares due to an inaccurate response from its AI chatbot on Twitter during a demonstration in February 2023 (Thorbecke, 2023).\\n\\nThe emergence of ChatGPT in the public sphere has ignited a surge of interest within the AI chatbot market (Davenport, 2023). Microsoft's announcement of a $10 billion investment in OpenAI has galvanized this trend, impelling other technology providers to join the race. Google recently unveiled an experimental service named “Bard” and “Project Magi,” aimed at revolutionizing web search experiences (Data Scientist, 2023), while Meta introduced LLaMA, a language model comprising 65 billion parameters (Meta, 2023). Similarly, Baidu launched a ChatGPT-style service named “Wenxin Yiyan” in Chinese or “Ernie Bot” in English. Additional entrants include Character.ai, an AI chatbot capable of impersonating famous individuals or fictional characters. South Korean search engine firm Naver has rolled out its own AI tool, HyperCLOVAX, which has been incorporated into its search engine and can analyze and generate text, images, videos, and audio. Similarly, in the L&SCM domain, Microsoft has unveiled a novel feature called Dynamics 365 Copilot as a part of its supply chain management platform (Microsoft Dynamics 365, 2023). The feature leverages AI to assist businesses in monitoring and reacting promptly to disruptions that might affect their supply chains. Following the identification of a possible risk, the system can automatically craft a message and send it to the concerned suppliers. Through this AI application, Microsoft aims to enhance the resilience of supply chains, promoting a more efficient and informed business operation strategy.\\n\\nWe anticipate that as new players continue to enter the AI market, the technology will grow more powerful and sophisticated, extending its business applications and potential business risks. In this context, integrating liquid neural networks with GPTs will allow the AI models to learn more effectively after the initial training and automatically, with minimal human interventions (Heater, 2023). Contrary to the hype surrounding generative AI systems like GPT-4, organizations face a Herculean task in training and operationalizing these systems within their existing business processes. This has profound implications for organizations planning to implement and use AI (Rese & Tränkner, 2024). The training process is labor-intensive and must align with organizational strategy. This raises issues of the type of training; there is a difference between technical mastery of an AI system and functional knowledge of the area of management or operations it is intended to facilitate.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='9e6a792f-8b88-4626-ada4-ea8d63bb3837', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\nIn contrast, traditional AI methods typically exhibit a more reactive approach, utilizing data for predictions but not necessarily creating anything new. For instance, regression analysis, a form of predictive AI, can forecast demand based on historical sales and logistics data. However, it does not fabricate new scenarios or the impact of strategic supply chain alternatives. AI could predict demand and formulate a comprehensive strategy for meeting that demand, including sourcing, production, distribution, and customer service activities. It might also extend alternative strategies, providing a range of options for decision makers. AI introduces an element of creativity and the capacity to generate fresh ideas (Dwivedi, Pandey, et al., 2023). For L&SCM, this could entail devising entirely new sourcing, procurement, and inventory management strategies. It enables dynamism and responsiveness typically not associated with more traditional, rule-based AI systems.\\n\\nIn the dynamic ecosystem of L&SCM, the integration of AI promises a seismic shift in operational paradigms, fundamentally reshaping practices both upstream, encompassing raw material acquisition, manufacturing intricacies, and supplier relations, as well as downstream, embodying distribution strategies, customer engagement, and after-sales services (IBM, 2023). As organizations navigate this complex transformation, it becomes imperative to decipher how AI can be a catalyst for innovation without succumbing to potential pitfalls. Upstream, AI can transform supplier relationships and inventory management through predictive analytics and real-time data processing. However, this transition necessitates a robust examination of data security and privacy concerns, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. Furthermore, an over-reliance on AI algorithms might potentially eclipse human expertise, creating a delicate balance to maintain.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the downstream supply chain benefits from enhanced customer experiences facilitated by AI-driven insights and personalization. However, this should be navigated with a conscientious approach to avoid potential ethical dilemmas, such as biased algorithms or misinformation, which might inadvertently arise during AI deployment (Ashok et al., 2022). Therefore, as organizations contemplate integrating AI, it is vital to foster an open and proactive approach to policy formulation and process implementation. This includes crafting well-rounded structural adjustments that capitalize on the efficiencies and innovations brought about by AI and preemptively address potential challenges, creating a resilient, ethical, and sustainable trajectory for the evolution of the L&SCM sector. This includes developing a multi-faceted strategy that engages stakeholders at all levels and encourages collaborative efforts to navigate the complex yet promising terrain that AI presents. Future research in L&SCM may look to understand how AI can transform practices both upstream and downstream, avoiding potential pitfalls that need to be considered before structural, policy, and process implementation adjustments plans are made concrete.\\n\\n# APPLICATIONS: IN PURSUIT OF DR. JEKYLL\\n\\n# Sourcing assessment and procurement\\n\\nThe application of generative AI in evaluating and choosing suppliers offers a revolutionary approach, surpassing conventional methods that typically involve manual analysis and decision making. AI's ability to swiftly scrutinize vast amounts of data from many prospective suppliers while considering a diverse range of parameters, including cost-effectiveness, product quality, reliability, operational efficiency, and sustainability, enables the generation of an optimal supplier portfolio. Furthermore, AI extends its inclusivity and equality promotion by proactively suggesting strategies to integrate minority-owned, women-owned, or veteran-owned enterprises within the supply chain. Enhanced by its text generation capacity, AI can provide in-depth descriptions of each supplier's advantages and drawbacks. Additionally, it can facilitate the creation of various negotiation tactics and contractual terms predicated on historical data and predicted supplier behavior.\\n\\n# Supply chain risk mitigation\\n\\nGenerative AI's utility extends to the domain of risk management (e.g., political, economic, cultural, and partner), where it assists in scenario-based risk assessment by generating potential disruption models, including instances like supplier insolvency, strikes, natural calamities, pandemics, and more. Through a detailed and ongoing analysis of potential disruptions and danger points, companies can devise resilient strategies to ensure business continuity. For example, in a supply chain disruption, AI can generate viable alternatives based on several factors tied to our traditional logistics service quality metrics (Mentzer et al., 2021), thereby maintaining customer service trade-off targets. These sophisticated models can also develop contingency plans for various disruptions, incorporating all input from managerial prompts.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='1140fee9-a69f-47c9-b4c1-6a0664ae9653', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# Procurement and inventory accuracy\\n\\nGenerative AI's predictive powers facilitate more accurate demand and sales forecasts, enabling companies to schedule their orders and quantities from suppliers optimally. This allows for lean management practices, mitigating waste and amplifying resource and process efficiency. In addition to demand prediction—a traditional application of the AI model, generative AI can craft flexible inventory policies, optimizing the costs of overstocking or understocking. For instance, it can formulate strategies for just-in-time inventory management, potentially decreasing storage costs and enhancing cash flow.\\n\\n# Distribution, transportation, and logistics coordination\\n\\nGenerative AI can formulate effective distribution strategies and logistic pathways, considering constraints and objectives, such as cost reduction, service level maximization, routing disruptions, weather conditions, and environmental considerations. Additionally, AI can develop backup plans in the event of disruptions such as traffic jams or severe weather. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of diverse, real-time data—including traffic, weather, vehicle specifications, and fuel costs—the AI can devise the most efficient transportation routes. For instance, the AI system can design a route for a delivery truck making several stops within a city that minimizes travel time or fuel usage. Furthermore, the AI can provide textual justifications for the selected routes, offering logistics managers a broader range of options and facilitating superior decision making. Given explicit constraints and stipulations as inputs, generative AI can architect ideal layouts for storage and picking activities within warehouses. Factors such as item-specific demand frequency, merchandise's physical dimensions, and various storage and handling apparatus capacities are integral to this algorithmic design.\\n\\n# Customer relations\\n\\nGenerative AI can be leveraged as chatbots within the consumer sector to automate interaction with clientele. This involves providing bespoke updates on order statuses, estimated delivery times and addressing inquiries or grievances. The upshot is enhancing customer satisfaction, overall experience, service quality, and client retention. In this context, these intricate models can aid in creating tailored marketing and sales strategies for distinct customer demographics, products, or regions based on predictive analysis of consumer data and market trends.\\n\\n# Sustainable and ethically conscious practices\\n\\nBy optimizing logistical routes, minimizing warehousing necessities, and bolstering resource utilization, AI can aid companies in diminishing their carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. AI can architect models to discern and evaluate the societal and environmental implications of sourcing from varied suppliers, thus aiding businesses in prioritizing fair trade and ethical sourcing practices. Moreover, these models could be deployed to strategize distribution efforts (particularly in sectors like health and food supply) to ensure adequate accessibility for underserved communities under regular conditions and during crises or disasters. For example, a corporation might employ generative AI to ensure diligent supply chain operations. The AI could scrutinize data from supplier audits, regulatory filings, and media reports to pinpoint potential compliance risks. Upon detecting a risk, such as a supplier contravening labor laws, the AI could suggest a spectrum of responses, including detailed audits, scouting alternative suppliers, or collaborating with suppliers to address the issue (Pan & Nishant, 2023).\\n\\n# CHALLENGES: CONTAINING MR. HYDE\\n\\nIn the current L&SCM landscape, the integration of AI promises unprecedented potential for innovation and efficiency. However, it is not devoid of substantial challenges. The adoption and integration of AI within existing frameworks propel a complex array of hurdles spanning ethical considerations, data privacy, transparency, and visibility (Morgan et al., 2023), copyright issues, the lack of regulatory templates, and workforce adaptability (Budhwar et al., 2023; Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). Moreover, the sector establishes robust strategies to safeguard against potential misuse and security breaches inherent with AI technologies and their variants, all while nurturing a synergy between human expertise and automated intelligence. As the L&SCM sector traverses this transformative journey, exploring these challenges is vital to creating a pathway that can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating the associated risks, fostering a SCM&L sector that is not only technologically advanced but also productive, resilient, and sustainable. In this context, we outline vital challenges below.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='3216033d-7ee7-4f28-84d7-dfa5388a6c2b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\n# Training AI\\n\\nTraining AI applications and their variants, like Chat-GPT, presents significant challenges when integrating them into any domain, including L&SCM. These applications require vast amounts of data to function optimally, and acquiring or generating these data can be resource-intensive. While data are one of the critical ingredients to operationalize AI within any business application, organizations, especially supply chain small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) partners, usually lack robust data management processes, policies, and technical infrastructure, which can significantly impede their ability to leverage AI applications within various business operations successfully. For AI systems like ChatGPT, high-quality, diverse, and representative data are imperative to ensure that the systems can generate meaningful and insightful outputs, depending on the context of use. Any gaps, inaccuracies, or corruption in the data can lead to AI models that are ineffective or even counterproductive, producing erroneous insights or perpetuating existing biases. Furthermore, organizations may find it challenging to comply with regulatory requirements surrounding data privacy and security without established data management processes. The absence of stringent data governance exposes an organization to legal ramifications, as they may unintentionally violate laws surrounding the use and handling of data, especially personal or sensitive information. This aspect becomes increasingly critical considering the global emphasis on data protection, as seen with regulations like the GDPR in Europe, new copyright rules for AI proposed by the European Commission, and a recent landmark judgment on images created by AI not eligible for copyright protection in the USA. Moreover, an inadequate data management policy can hinder scalability and usefulness. As businesses evolve, the volume and complexity of data they handle often grow exponentially. Without structured processes to manage these data effectively, organizations might be overwhelmed and unable to leverage the full potential of AI applications, which thrive on big data environments to offer deeper insights and analysis.\\n\\n# Issue of biases\\n\\nThe training process itself is susceptible to incorporating biases present in the training data, which can lead to biased outputs and potentially flawed decision-making processes. Media reports and academic research have highlighted numerous instances where AI systems have exhibited biased behavior. Reports have showcased AI systems displaying racial, gender, or age biases in various applications like recruitment, credit scoring, and law enforcement. This undermines the credibility and reliability of AI systems and raises serious ethical concerns. The primary reason behind the incorporation of biases in any AI model is the presence of biased data used during the training phase. These biases can occur due to various factors, including the historical data containing prejudices, lack of representation of minority groups, and the perspectives of the creators influencing the data collection process. When AI models are trained on such data, they naturally absorb these biases, influencing their decision-making process. Implications of such biases can be manifold. In the context of L&SCM, this could mean that the AI system might unjustly prioritize certain suppliers, products, or regions, possibly leading to unequal opportunities and systemic discrimination. It can also result in flawed forecasting and suboptimal decision making, significantly affecting an organization's efficiency and effectiveness.\\n\\n# Operationalization\\n\\nOperationalizing AI applications, especially in L&SCM, can be a complex and nuanced endeavor. AI's reinforcement learning process demands data consolidation, human expertise, and technological acumen. In reinforcement learning, a model learns to interact with an environment to achieve some goal or maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The model learns through trial and error, effectively learning the best actions to take in various states. While powerful, this approach requires considerable computational resources, and the learning process can sometimes be somewhat opaque, making it difficult to fully predict or understand the model's decisions. In the context of AI, “hallucinations” refer to instances where the model generates outputs that are not based on actual data or factual information but are fabricated or distorted by the model itself. These hallucinations can be a significant problem in L&SCM, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. In logistics management, incorrect predictions or decisions by an AI system can have substantial economic repercussions. For instance, an AI system incorrectly predicting a surge in demand for a particular product can result in overstocking, increased carrying costs, and potential obsolescence. Conversely, underestimating demand can result in stockouts, lost sales, and damaged customer relationships. In the L&SCM domain, the insights and expertise of seasoned professionals are often indispensable. These professionals can provide nuanced inputs to guide the reinforcement learning process, helping fine-tune the model to reflect real-world complexities relevant to the logistics manager.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='b651aaae-d91b-44f1-ad04-6156e210a4b5', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\nInsights into managing supply chain disruptions, which can be incorporated into the AI system to make it more robust and adaptable (Johnson et al., 2022). Developing and maintaining an AI application requires a team with expertise in data science, machine learning, software development, and other technical areas, which is also capital-intensive and often difficult to contemplate for smaller businesses. For instance, integrating AI capabilities into a warehouse management system might require technical expertise to ensure seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure, real-time data processing capabilities, and the development of user-interfaces for end-users.\\n\\n# Cyber-resilience\\n\\nAI-related data breaches are a growing concern, particularly in L&SCM, where a vast amount of sensitive information is handled regularly. Data breaches can occur as a result of insufficiently secured databases or networks, which malicious actors can exploit to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, phishing schemes, targeting weak links in the supply chain, like a smaller supplier with lesser security protocols, to make their way into larger companies' databases, and poorly secured APIs (used to collect data, feed into AI model and access AI output), which can be exploited to extract data or introduce malicious code into the AI system. For example, the SolarWinds cyber-attack (2020) stood out as a significant incident not solely due to the compromise of one firm but because it initiated a far-reaching supply chain disruption impacting numerous entities, including the U.S. government. Recently, in March 2023, the developers of ChatGPT reported a technical glitch that inadvertently allowed some users to access the chat histories of others, exposing sensitive personal information, such as the last four digits of credit card numbers and their respective expiration dates.\\n\\nA data breach can result in losing business opportunities, as customers and partners might choose to dissociate from a compromised organization. Following a breach, organizations must invest heavily in upgrading their security infrastructure and protocols. Organizations might face increased scrutiny from regulators, including potential audits and stricter regulatory requirements. Organizations might face legal actions from affected parties, including customers, suppliers, or shareholders. Given the increasing reliance on AI systems in supply chain and logistics management, organizations must be cognizant of the heightened risks of data breaches. Proactive measures, including securing networks, safeguarding data, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, can go a long way in protecting organizations from the significant threats posed by data breaches. However, they are resource and capital-intensive and require human skills.\\n\\n# Business models and strategies\\n\\nImplementing AI applications within the intricate spheres of L&SCM requires a monumental shift in the organizational frameworks and business operations. These transformations will likely influence the supply chain friendly configuration, revamp decision-making protocols, and initiate substantial shifts in the organizational structure. However, this is largely uncharted and unexplored territory, especially when considering the capabilities and limitations of AI models compared with existing AI systems. In the contemporary scenario, organizations find themselves navigating a business landscape that is dynamic, volatile, crisis-driven, uncertain, and deeply influenced by rapidly evolving technology. They are caught in a complex scenario of escalating their sustainability initiatives while advancing their digital infrastructure to retain a competitive edge. These twin imperatives necessitate a deep and thoughtful recalibration of their existing business models, urging them to innovate and evolve.\\n\\nHowever, business model innovation is a formidable challenge for any organization. It demands substantial resources and capital and involves a level of risk, given that the returns on investment are not guaranteed and are seldom realized in the short term. For instance, a wealth of data is available on circular economy business models and cases, which can serve as a training ground for AI models. These AI systems can subsequently assist in devising robust change management strategies, a critical component in any re-engineering and innovation endeavors. However, the practical implementation of these recommendations remains a complex domain where the expertise of L&SCM professionals is indispensable. Their years of hands-on experience, deep-rooted tacit knowledge, and keen understanding of the current organizational structures will play a decisive role in evaluating the feasibility of the proposed changes.\\n\\nFurthermore, we encounter a significant gap when we explore emerging concepts like regenerative business models (Koniezko et al., 2023), which build upon and extend the principles of circular economy models. In their current stage of development, AI applications might fall short in offering organizations a comprehensive blueprint to revamp existing business processes and supply chain configurations. The limited data on successful regenerative business models and cognitive barriers, such as a lack of consensus on their potential to enhance sustainable business performance, pose significant challenges.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7f64657b-b788-46b5-b9ab-42332f723f58', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\nMoreover, suppose organizations contemplate integrating diverse business models, such as servitization and regenerative frameworks. In that case, they might find that AI models fail to offer a clear pathway for successful implementation despite being fed with abundant data. This limitation arises from a few fundamental factors: (a) AI's constrained ability to critically analyze the benefits and drawbacks of integrating two distinct business models; (b) its lack of depth in understanding the nuances of supply chain configurations, stakeholder relationships, and cultural dynamics, which is often developed through years of industry experience; (c) its limited comprehension of human cognition, organizational culture, and the multifaceted intricacies that govern business ecosystems. Therefore, while the journey toward integrating AI in restructuring business operations holds promise, it is filled with complexities and challenges that necessitate a collaborative, thoughtful, and adaptive approach.\\n\\n# Workforce dynamics\\n\\nThe infiltration of AI applications within the L&SCM sector embodies a potent force capable of comprehensively reshaping the industry's employment dynamics. This signals a transformative shift that promises to redefine the contours of work dynamics, employment landscapes, and the nature of jobs within the sector, which has been widely discussed in the existing literature (Klumpp & Ruiner, 2022).\\n\\nGoldman Sachs research indicates that approximately 300 million full-time positions globally, including two-thirds in the U.S. and Europe, face the potential of being replaced by AI (Vallance, 2023). Concurrently, recent data from the OECD suggest that AI could readily automate nearly 27% of roles in OECD nations that predominantly rely on human expertise (OECD Employment Outlook, 2023). Additionally, a separate study by the Pew Research Center revealed that one out of every five American workers occupy a position susceptible to AI substitution (Kochhar, 2023). While the influence of AI-driven digitalization on the low-skilled workforce is well documented in the existing literature (Duan et al., 2019; Dwivedi et al., 2021), recent events have underscored its growing impact on high-skilled professions that have traditionally depended on human intelligence, creativity, higher-order thinking, and tacit intuitive experience (Budhwar et al., 2023; Grennan & Michaely, 2020; The White House, 2022). Notable examples include Hollywood writers and actors striking for stricter regulations on studios' AI usage to protect human jobs and Harvard University's controversial decision to replace human teachers with an AI chatbot for coding lessons this fall. These incidents highlight the urgent need to re-evaluate and adapt to the evolving dynamics of AI in the professional landscape.\\n\\nTherefore, the impact on the nature of jobs will likely be profound. Tasks that were once manual and time-consuming might soon be automated, enabling a more streamlined and efficient workflow (Loske, 2022). This automation, while boosting productivity, which is debatable, may also engender a shift in the skill sets demanded in the workplace. Employees might need to adapt by fostering skills that complement the capabilities of AI, focusing on areas where human intelligence holds a distinctive edge, such as strategic thinking, problem solving, persuasion, negotiation, and interpersonal relations.\\n\\nJob replacement and displacement are likely consequential outcomes of this technological adoption.

This shift can potentially disrupt existing job structures, possibly leading to the displacement of workers in specific roles. However, it is crucial to note that the emergence of AI may also lead to new job opportunities. These jobs might involve managing, maintaining, and optimizing AI systems, necessitating a workforce adept at navigating advanced technology's nuances. Simultaneously, the employment landscape within the L&SCM sector is slated to undergo significant transformations. Organizations might increasingly lean toward a workforce that can collaborate seamlessly with AI systems, fostering a symbiotic relationship that leverages the strengths of both humans and machines, that is, collaborative intelligence (Chowdhury et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2022). Organizations must proactively plan and formulate strategies considering these developments. This includes investment in training and reskilling programs, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and developing frameworks that facilitate smooth transitions and adaptations to the changing job landscapes.\\n\\n# AN ONGOING CALL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\\n\\nConsidering the evolving landscape of AI applications, a comprehensive examination of its implications and challenges is critical, particularly within the L&SCM sector. We have developed a research framework illustrated in Figure 2 to facilitate this.\\n\\nThis framework aims to serve as a navigational chart steering future research direction, revealing the interaction between the attributes of AI and the organizational outcomes that are highly valued within the L&SCM sector.

Subsequently, this propels a transformation in L&SCM processes, paving the way for innovative business models. Furthermore, this transition is not confined to altering job availability or the nature of existing roles. It permeates deeper, influencing how individuals view their positions within the professional sphere. This shift is apparent in the evolving preferences for skill development, where there is a growing emphasis on continuous learning to maintain relevance in a swiftly changing environment. Finally, this leads to a transformation in the L&SCM sector, particularly concerning productivity, sustainability, and corporate responsibility outcomes. Through the integration of AI, we anticipate a substantial evolution in the L&SCM sector, which promises to steer it toward a future characterized by heightened efficiency, resilience, and responsiveness to emerging global demands and challenges.\\n\\n# FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE AI ADOPTION\\n\\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, the exploration of factors both propelling and hindering the adoption of emerging technologies forms a critical frontier for future research.

The focus should be on creating frameworks and methodologies that enable organizations to fully leverage AI's potential while navigating this technological shift's complexities and challenges.\\n\\n# WORK, EMPLOYMENT, AND BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION\\n\\nAI applications such as ChatGPT in the L&SCM sector promise to bring significant shifts in the labor market dynamics, influencing work design, organizational dynamics, employment patterns, job roles, and career trajectories (Zagorin, 2023). This phenomenon necessitates comprehensive research to understand the nuances of these transitions and equip stakeholders with the knowledge and strategies to navigate them successfully. Here, we provide a roadmap for future research in this area:\\n\\n- What new roles and responsibilities are expected to emerge with the integration of AI in the L&SCM sector?\\n- How will the skill requirements evolve for professionals in this sector by adopting AI-enabled technologies?\\n- Which strategies can be implemented to facilitate a smooth workforce transition into AI-integrated environments?\\n- How can training programs be designed to upskill and reskill existing employees for new roles generated due to AI adoption across different generations?\\n- How is AI integration expected to influence career development and progression patterns in the L&SCM sector?\\n- What new opportunities and challenges might professionals encounter in their career paths with the evolution of AI?\\n- What are the implications of AI adoption on job security, worker rights, and labor market dynamics? The aim should be to study changing employment patterns, including contractual arrangements, freelance opportunities, wage structures, employment rates, and job security.\\n- What ethical considerations are associated with AI-induced transitions in the job market?\\n- How can organizations ensure inclusivity and fairness in AI-driven job environments?\\n- How can policymakers foster a conducive environment for AI integration while safeguarding employee interests?\\n\\nTherefore, future research should focus on developing a balanced pathway that maximizes the benefits of AI integration while mitigating potential adverse impacts on the workforce. Through empirical analysis, researchers can help forge a future where AI transforms the sector and fosters an environment characterized by growth, opportunity, and inclusivity along the key tenets of Industry 5.0.\\n\\nAI is a promising catalyst for fostering regenerative and servitization business models in the L&SCM sector. On one hand, the regenerative model emphasizes restoring, renewing, and revitalizing one's sources of energy and materials, creating sustainable systems that integrate the community and environment at their core (Hahn & Tampe, 2021). AI can facilitate this by optimizing resource allocation, predicting material life cycles, and helping to create closed-loop systems that minimize waste and nurture the natural environment. On the other hand, the servitization model is centered on transitioning from selling products to delivering comprehensive services that offer higher value to customers. AI can play a pivotal role by analyzing customer data to craft personalized service offerings, predicting product maintenance needs before issues arise, and fostering dynamic and responsive service delivery channels. Through the adept analysis and utilization of heterogeneous big data, AI can thus aid in constructing innovative business models.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='cbc9c2c5-e019-4b84-a629-696622966d18', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\nthat drive economic growth and promote environmental rejuvenation and a more customer-centric approach, paving the way toward a more sustainable and service-oriented business landscape. This would pave the way for a new era where business models are characterized by innovation, inclusivity, and value creation. Several research questions that are critical to fostering a more profound comprehension and facilitating successful adaptation to the evolving business environment are as follows:\\n\\n- How can AI enhance service delivery and customer experience in the L&SCM sector?\\n- What novel business models can emerge to leverage AI capabilities in enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction?\\n- How can AI facilitate the integration of sustainable practices and circular economy principles into business models?\\n- What role can AI play in fostering business models that promote resource efficiency and waste reduction?\\n- How can AI contribute to enhancing transparency and traceability in supply chains?\\n- What innovative business models can be developed to leverage AI for real-time tracking and reporting in supply chains?\\n- How can AI aid in developing business models that enhance risk management and resilience in supply chains?\\n- What are the prospects for AI in facilitating predictive analytics for proactive risk mitigation?\\n- How can AI contribute to developing regenerative business models in the L&SCM sector focusing on societal benefits and ecological restoration?\\n- What innovative strategies can be formulated using AI to foster business models that promote environmental regeneration and social equity?\\n- How can organizations ensure compliance with regulatory requirements while adopting AI-driven business models?\\n\\nThe future research landscape should shed light on AI's transformative potential in shaping innovative business models within the L&SCM sector. By exploring the complex implications of AI integration, researchers can contribute to the evolution of business strategies that not only leverage the capabilities of AI but also foster sustainability, efficiency, and resilience in the industry.\\n\\n# LEVEL 4: L&SCM OUTCOMES\\n\\nThe future research landscape examining the impact of implementing AI applications, particularly focusing on productivity and performance enhancements, is vast and promising (Wamba et al., 2023).

Through rigorous studies, researchers can foster a knowledge base that guides organizations in leveraging AI to craft a more efficient, sustainable, and responsive supply chain landscape. Future research should prioritize an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from fields such as environmental science, data science, and L&SCM management, to holistically study the potential of AI in fostering a more sustainable L&SCM management. This includes analyzing the direct impacts on environmental and social sustainability and examining the broader implications for industry practices, policies, and governance structures. The key research questions that emerge are outlined below.\\n\\n- How can AI facilitate the development of more sustainable supply chain networks?\\n- In what ways can AI enhance transparency and traceability within the supply chain to promote sustainability?\\n- Can AI play a pivotal role in enhancing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of supply chain operations?\\n- How can AI-driven analytics assist in crafting sustainable transportation and logistics strategies?\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='4df22339-976d-48ae-95e5-523a52227669', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\n# How can AI facilitate the design and development of sustainable products and services?\\n\\n# How can AI assist organizations in fulfilling their corporate social responsibility (CSR) commitments?\\n\\n# In what ways can AI enhance stakeholder engagement and collaboration to promote sustainability?\\n\\n# How can AI assist organizations in complying with sustainability-related regulations and policies?\\n\\n# What role can AI play in enhancing governance structures to promote sustainability in supply chain operations?\\n\\n# Which sustainability development goals will benefit from adopting AI applications in the L&SCM sector?\\n\\nInvestigating the ramifications of incorporating AI technologies in enhancing due diligence within the L&SCM sector offers a novel frontier that warrants a detailed exploration of how AI can facilitate risk mitigation, compliance, and transparency. Potential research avenues and critical questions that might shape future scholarly efforts in this area are outlined below.\\n\\n# How can AI aid in identifying and mitigating risks at various stages of the supply chain?\\n\\n# To what extent can AI technologies provide predictive insights into potential disruptions and vulnerabilities in the supply chain?\\n\\n# How can AI streamline and enhance the supplier evaluation process?\\n\\n# Can AI applications provide more comprehensive insights into supplier performance and reliability?\\n\\n# How can AI facilitate compliance with ever-evolving regulatory requirements within the supply chain sector?\\n\\n# Can AI tools assist organizations in maintaining adherence to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards?\\n\\n# In what ways can AI technologies enhance financial due diligence processes in the L&SCM sector?\\n\\n# Can AI provide more sophisticated tools for financial analysis and forecasting?\\n\\n# To what extent can AI technologies provide real-time insights into product journeys and supply chain operations?\\n\\n# Can AI foster ethical procurement and sourcing practices?\\n\\nIntegrating AI technologies in the L&SCM sector promises a transformation with several implications. As we forge ahead into this new frontier, the necessity for robust research into the legal, policy, and regulatory landscapes governing this adoption becomes paramount. In an inherently complex and globally interconnected sector, jurisdiction, compliance, and enforcement questions arise as critical areas of study.\\n\\n# LEVEL 5: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL FRAMEWORKS\\n\\nAt its core, AI stands apart from previous technological advancements owing to its inherent ability to recommend decisions, adapt based on learning experiences, and progressively enhance interactions based on acquired knowledge (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). This evolutionary process is markedly distinct from earlier technological transitions, primarily focused on altering or replacing manual tasks with automated processes. Moreover, current AI applications like ChatGPT and Bard excel at understanding the nuances of natural language through patterns and sequences and possess a remarkable ability to comprehend and contextually generate text, offering more sophisticated and coherent responses over extended interactions.\\n\\nTherefore, AI possesses an array of complex layers that redefine its integration into various sectors (Makarius et al., 2020). These complexities can be categorized into various dimensions, including cognitive aspects that relate to the capabilities and limitations of AI systems and relational facets, which encompass the several factors that come into play during the AI adoption process. Furthermore, the structural dimension encapsulates AI's extensive impact on work patterns, organizational structures, the interaction between AI and employees, and regulatory complexity, underscoring the imperative need for ethical considerations and fostering sustainable AI utilization. This transition has precipitated blurred boundaries between human roles and machine functionalities, fostering a paradigm where automated decision-making processes are increasingly intertwined with contextual complexities. Given this backdrop, it becomes apparent that the existing theoretical frameworks may fall short of capturing the depth and breadth of transformations resulting from AI in the L&SCM sector. The disruptions and evolutions caused by AI are profound and unprecedented, often bypassing the boundaries established by traditional theories.\\n\\nThus, navigating the nuanced landscape created by AI requires the development of a more sophisticated theoretical lens. This lens should be capable of comprehending the multifaceted complexities introduced by AI, offering a dynamic and adaptive blueprint to study and understand the radical shifts occurring in the L&SCM sector. As we stand on the cusp of this transformation, it is incumbent upon us to foster a theoretical approach that resonates with the dynamism and innovation due to AI, thereby facilitating a seamless integration and application of AI into the L&SCM landscape, which will lead to productivity, sustainability, and resilience.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='73bc6ad2-44ea-4be8-9d5c-70961b60e03f', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L\\n\\nsynergizing with human expertise. The key research questions that might help with these dimensions are outlined below.\\n\\n- To what extent can existing theories in the L&SCM sector comprehensively address the implications and integration of AI?\\n- What notable gaps and limitations are present in current theories when examining the phenomena of AI integration in the L&SCM sector, and how might these be addressed to foster a deeper understanding?\\n- How might synthesizing existing theories and insights from interdisciplinary studies enhance the comprehension and explanation of AI's potential impact on the L&SCM sector?\\n- What novel theories can or should be formulated to holistically understand the AI phenomena within the L&SCM sector, and what rationale underpins the necessity for such theoretical development?\\n\\n# Methodological approaches\\n\\nThe research issues and agenda presented in the section above clearly suggest that the domain is complex, necessitating the use of several established and emerging methods to address the research questions mentioned earlier. In other words, a rigorous examination of the application of AI in L&SCM demands a multi- or mixed-method research approach. Below, we outline a few quantitative and qualitative methods suitable for conducting rigorous research in this domain.\\n\\nBeginning with the experimental research method, it stands as a pivotal tool in evaluating the effectiveness of AI applications within a controlled environment. Researchers have the latitude to create AI system prototypes and subject them to diverse simulated conditions to gauge their performance. This could encompass tasks such as leveraging AI for demand forecasting—with generative models trained to anticipate future demand trends based on past data—or utilizing AI for route optimization to devise the most time and cost-efficient transportation routes. Furthermore, experiential research may facilitate a detailed comparison of the efficiency and efficacy of AI tools against outputs derived from traditional methods, including manual approaches. Survey-based theory testing can be employed to delve into issues surrounding the adoption and utilization of AI, especially at an individual level. In addition, methodologies such as regression analysis and time-series forecasting can be applied to scrutinize extensive datasets and further the development of predictive models. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be leveraged to empower AI systems to autonomously formulate solutions based on data analysis.\\n\\nQualitative research can complement quantitative methods, allowing for a deeper understanding through interviews and focus groups involving industry stakeholders. This method is instrumental in exploring the practical challenges and opportunities of implementing AI in logistics and supply chain management, thus guiding the AI systems to align with end-user requirements and preferences. The case study method offers a fertile ground for understanding individual or comparative scenarios, providing a rich narrative of AI deployment in various logistical contexts. For instance, case studies might explore the enhancements AI can bring to warehouse management through optimal storage and retrieval strategies. The approach is equally potent in examining the usage and impact of AI at both organizational and team levels. Additionally, grounded theory methodology can be utilized to build theories closely tied to the data accumulated during research, supporting the creation of AI systems grounded in empirical evidence.\\n\\nAction research can be employed as an iterative method, promoting a cycle of planning, action, observation, and reflection, thereby aiding the development of adaptive and optimized AI systems. This approach welcomes real-time adjustments to AI systems, reflecting feedback acquired during the testing phases. Similar outcomes can be achieved through Action Design Research. By harnessing a blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods, researchers can forge a substantial understanding of the potential and constraints of AI in L&SCM, guiding the way to innovative and pragmatic solutions in this arena. The essential research questions that are relevant to methodologies for examining the impact of AI in L&SCM are outlined below:\\n\\n- What are the appropriate research designs and methods to investigate the impact of AI at micro, macro, and meso levels in L&SCM?\\n- What methodologies can be applied to study the potential biases and inequalities introduced by the integration of AI in L&SCM?\\n- What are the appropriate metrics and evaluation techniques to measure the impact of AI on supply chain efficiency and productivity?\\n- How can mixed methods be used to understand the human experience and perspectives on the increasing role of AI in logistics?\\n- How do existing and new research methodologies assist in identifying and understanding potential innovations in L&SCM through the lens of AI development?\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='b5514eed-b868-435d-b8d4-ccecddcff22b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# EDITORIAL\\n\\n# CONCLUSION AND PAPERS IN THIS ISSUE\\n\\nJBL has a long history of supporting research connected to and advancing the practice of L&SCM. While this generative AI discussion opens the door to an ongoing call for related research in L&SCM, this journal always supports technology-oriented research. The first three papers in this issue continue our 45-year tradition of examining emerging tech-based topics like Blockchain, e-fulfillment systems, and Industry 4.0 trends.\\n\\nIn “Exploring Blockchain for Disaster Prevention and Relief: A Comprehensive Framework Based on Industry Case Studies,” Treiblmaier and Rejeb employ a group of case studies to investigate how Blockchain solutions can be implemented in disaster prevention and relief scenarios. Examining the roles of key stakeholders, the authors illustrate firm motivations in deploying blockchain technology, listing the relevant properties and highlighting contingency factors. Findings demonstrate blockchain opportunities for streamlining information flows and augmenting stakeholder capabilities. Using L&SCM technology to save lives is a priority for our research. Expect to see growing attention to humanitarian logistics in JBL soon!\\n\\nIn the second paper, “Modularization of the Front-End Logistics Services in e-Fulfillment,” Yurt et al. (2023) explore the context of service modularity in customer-facing logistics for e-fulfillment. We were happy to receive this paper as we continue to call for more consumer logistics work. Expect a special topic forum in early 2024. These authors used an online survey of customers to extract data and identify clusters (multichannel shoppers, infrequent shoppers, and online fans), providing preliminary evidence on how commonality and variability aspects of service modularity optimize the number of service options and related performance levels.\\n\\nPessot et al. (2023) move up to the industry level by “Empowering supply chains with Industry 4.0 technologies to face megatrends.” They leverage focus group interviews to investigate how megatrends impact the supply chain landscape and the role of technology in supporting supply chain alignment. Five supply chain capabilities are identified as prevalent and fitting external contingencies. The study also highlights and compares the potential of I4.0 technologies and their applications in supporting specific supply chain capabilities. This is a paper that should open minds to future research ideas.\\n\\nFollowing the first three technology-oriented articles in this issue, we continue to work to push more papers into every annual volume of JBL. There is no cap on the number of papers we will publish. If we can get 100 quality papers, we will publish 100 quality papers. The remaining five papers in this final issue are top quality and cover diverse topics, bringing us to 32 citable papers for the year.\\n\\nFrom the world of transportation, Balthrop et al. (2023) bring us “How do trucking companies respond to announced versus unannounced safety crackdowns? The case of government inspection blitzes.” This paper embraces our ongoing call for policy research (see: Richey & Davis-Sramek, 2022a, 2022b). The authors investigate how motor carriers respond to changes in the likelihood of regulation via inspections. Using a longitudinal dataset, they find that firms with lower compliance costs and higher costs of avoiding inspections improve compliance before and during announced “blitzes.” Small firms with lower avoidance costs tend to avoid announced blitzes, whereas unannounced blitzes result in no changes in compliance or avoidance.\\n\\nWe also continue to call for work on last-mile delivery. The last mile is where research and reviewers are in short supply. In “You're Driving Me Crazy! How Emotions Elicited by Negative Driver Behaviors Impact Customer Outcomes in Last Mile Delivery,” Masorgo et al. (2023) run a scenario-based experiment examining—who is at the door with a package? As delivery drivers increasingly act as e-tailers' frontline employees via home deliveries, negative driver behaviors increasingly impact customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Driver affiliation is altering the magnitude of customer responses. Results show that the adverse effects of driver-inappropriate behavior on customer outcomes are mediated by anger and that the effects of driver inflexibility are mediated by sadness. Additionally, the negative effect of driver inflexibility on customer outcomes is weaker for outsourced logistics than for private fleet drivers. Driver-inappropriate behavior exhibits similar adverse effects on customer outcomes for both driver affiliations.\\n\\nThe final three papers examine classic strategic issues of postponement, relationship-based sourcing, and inventory substitution. These issues deserve additional attention as we move through a post-pandemic paradigm shift. In a much-needed study titled “Revisiting postponement: Boundary-crossing problems and tax implications for global supply chains of integrated solutions,” Norrman and Prataviera (2023) examine postponement decision making for global supply chains. This one-to-four case study approach explores decisions, related fiscal and legal implications, and cross-functional integration at a global high-tech enterprise. The authors detail the contextual drivers of increased postponement boundary complexity to illustrate changes in its decision making.\\n\\nIn “Competitive actions and supply chain relationships: How suppliers' value-diminishing actions affect buyers' procurement decisions,” Hofer et al. (2023) use econometric and panel data-based analysis to span the...\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='88b53926-1b4b-4ba8-9788-33ba38c37069', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L\\n\\neffects of competitive actions in the context of vertical buyer–supplier relationships, explicitly examining how a supplier firm's value-diminishing competitive actions lead to subsequent reductions in the buyer's procurement allocations and how contextual factors moderate such effects. Findings show that a supplier's value-diminishing actions are associated with decreases in buyer purchases from the supplier, as well as the supplier's downstream vertical relatedness and the degree to which rival suppliers pursue value-diminishing actions moderate this effect.\\n\\nFinally, Pritchard et al. (2023) examine a classic logistics problem related to fill rates and stockouts. This study is an excellent example of how even our neo-classical expectations from Deming and other JIT and lean experts are no longer generally accepted, nor should they be if we indeed are focused on the customer. In “The impact of stockout-based switching on fill rates,” the authors examine how customer substitution behavior can influence customer service measures. The authors find that item fill rate is primarily a function of the target service level of the focal item and the willingness to switch from an alternate item to the focal item. Category fill rate is influenced by the target service level of both items, with a willingness to switch amplifying their effect. However, the decision tree approach can overestimate the item fill rate when the willingness to substitute from the alternate item increases and accurately predicts category fill rates outside of scenarios with asymmetric substitutability.\\n\\nWe hope volume 44 of JBL has been informative and impactful.

Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI’s potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nArtificial intelligence · Generative AI · ChatGPT · Business model innovation · Large language models\\n\\n# JEL Classification\\n\\nM10 · M13 · M15 · M19\\n\\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7deb4674-d253-462d-853e-1e58e67887d0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 1. Introduction\\n\\nOne million users in five days and 100 million monthly users just two months after launch: such record-breaking growth makes ChatGPT one of the fastest-growing consumer applications (Hu 2023). To put this into context, it took Instagram two and a half years to get 100 million users, and TikTok reached this milestone after nine months (Chow 2023). ChatGPT is just one—albeit prominent—example of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications. GAI refers to a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate text, images, audio, code, videos, and synthetic data (Davenport and Mittal 2022; Gordijn and Have 2023). Recent interest in GAI has been driven by the simplicity of the user interfaces, which allow seemingly everyone, regardless of prior expertise, to generate content within seconds. As of right now, practitioners and researchers stand at the very beginning of a journey to understand GAI’s capabilities, reach, and impact on society and economy alike. Multiple studies and research endeavors foresee potentially significant implications for companies’ processes, way of working, interaction with customers, and ultimately the core of their business models through GAI (Agrawal et al. 2022; Dwivedi et al. 2023). However, not all business functions and, subsequently, not all industries appear yet to be affected to the same degree by GAI. First analyses predict that white collar tasks such as administrative support will be more affected than manual labor-related functions required, for example, in construction or manufacturing which are less prone to automation (Eloundou et al. 2023). Already a few months after the launch of ChatGPT, confronting the public with the capabilities of such large language models (LLM), researchers and industry experts forecast a significant boost to human creativity and productivity while simultaneously estimating that 300 million jobs could be affected by AI, making it a potentially significant change driver in society (Kelly 2023). Also in the context of academic research, a discussion about the potential implications of GAI has started (e.g. Burger et al. 2023; Stokel-Walker 2022).\\n\\nThe past has shown that the emergence of groundbreaking technologies, such as personal computers or the internet, force companies to adapt and innovate their business models to stay competitive and relevant (Amit and Zott 2020). And the future influence of GAI is compared to that one of personal computers or the internet by industry experts (Konrad and Cai 2023). The rapid development of GAI is not only an external factor but a catalyst for internal change, requiring businesses to rethink and potentially restructure their business models to stay ahead in a highly competitive and swiftly evolving landscape.\\n\\nThe aim of this study is therefore to provide a BMI perspective on GAI, with two main contributions: (1) The derivation of six propositions about GAI’s potential impact on industry-overarching business and working environment dynamics as drivers for BMI. (2) Building on three BMI categories (a) value creation innovation, (b) new proposition innovation, and (c) value capture innovation (Kraus et al. 2022b), examining three industries, namely software engineering, healthcare, and financial services, with regards to the potential implications of GAI.\\n\\nGiven the empirical relevance and recency of the topic, an in-depth qualitative content analysis, based on a scoping review methodology that builds on an', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='82f41d57-beb6-4251-8dc0-7f524c337362', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\nextensive sample of 513 sources is utilized. The research protocol hereby yielded data points classified into two clusters, (a) data obtained from academic journal publications (n = 410), and (b) data acquired from non-academic sources, such as online newspapers and online repositories of the companies that have developed GAI (n = 103).\\n\\nThe study’s findings highlight how GAI’s rapid advancements enable novel capabilities, leading to improved efficiencies and the emergence of new products and services. Simultaneously, GAI is potentially transforming skill requirements, shifting the human role from content creation to evaluation and editing. GAI could also drive new revenue models and cost structures, lowering content production costs and enabling various innovative monetization strategies. As GAI continues to evolve, businesses must adapt to harness its power, with their future success depending on their ability to integrate GAI technologies and continually explore new growth opportunities. The rise of GAI represents a paradigm shift, democratizing knowledge access and content creation, ultimately reshaping how businesses operate and innovate.\\n\\nThereby, the study contributes to three academic discussions: First, it adds to the emerging discussion about the implications of GAI on businesses (e.g., Dwivedi et al. 2023; Daugherty et al. 2023; Mathew 2023) by adopting a BMI perspective. Second, it contributes to the growing discussion at the interface of digital technologies and BMI (e.g., Ancillai et al. 2023; Aström et al. 2022; Jorzik et al. 2023). Third, it extends the discussion of artificial intelligence and analytics in management context (e.g., Korherr et al. 2022; Korherr and Kanbach 2023; Sáez-Ortuño et al. 2023).\\n\\n# Theoretical background: business model innovation\\n\\nThe investigation of business model development and innovation has emerged as a prominent area of research over recent decades (Clauss et al. 2020; Foss and Saebi 2016). Scholars have conceptualized BMI as an attempt to create, implement, and sustain strategies to generate, deliver, and capture value (Kraus et al. 2020). Innovation in this context involves modifying the architecture or configuration of a business model regarding its activities and components (Clauss et al. 2020; Dymitrowski and Mielcarek 2021; Reim et al. 2020). Lee et al. (2019) regard AI as a catalyst for BMI, providing momentum for companies to adapt their current approaches. Lindgren (2016) goes further, arguing that firms must incorporate advanced technologies such as AI to remain competitive. The recent emergence of GAI has further sparked this discussion. Consequently, business models are becoming increasingly divergent due to the groundbreaking technologies that have entered and altered the market. Existing literature focuses on the process of BMI and the nature of change, whereby the process is something internal (Katsamakas and Pavlov 2019) and the introduction of new tools such as ChatGPT can be seen as an external factor. The rapid development and progress of GAI requires firms to alternate. The significance of BMI is shifting from internal perspectives to external developments that impact a business and its need to innovate.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='55d8c0ed-7e8d-48e1-8d0f-52e8c20ba282', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='D. K. Kanbach et al.\\n\\nThe lifespan of a business model is often limited in rapidly evolving digital environments with new technologies, where a previously successful business model in the field of competitors is threatened (Valter et al. 2018). This means companies must proactively seek new configurations of their business model components, even before external pressures necessitate changes (Neuhuettler et al. 2020). In addition, in dynamic environments characterized by significant changes or technological breakthroughs such as the emergence of GAI, constant BMIs are essential (Breier et al. 2021). In the context of BMI, changes to specific business model components, such as the use of modern methods and techniques like those AI provides, can impact a firm’s success, even if not all components change simultaneously (Clauss et al. 2020). According to Clauss et al. (2020), changes to business models can vary in extent and scope, from incremental modifications to entirely novel and radical solutions forced by new technical opportunities. A recent model which builds upon the literature described above and captures the latest findings on BMI dimensions is developed by Kraus et al. (2022b) based on Clauss (2017) and Spieth and Schneider (2015). The framework includes the categories (1) value creation innovation, (2) new proposition innovation, and (3) value capture innovation, with accompanying sub-categories that each are potential drivers of innovation within the respective categories (see Fig. 1).\\n\\nThe model delineates three categories of BMI. First, in terms of “value creation innovation” technological advancements play a pivotal role in driving BMI (Clauss 2017). Companies striving to gain a competitive edge must continuously innovate through the adoption of new technologies or processes (Needleman et al. 2021). This necessitates the acquisition of expert knowledge of the new technology and its broader context (Desai et al. 2014). Regarding AI, companies must be adept at integrating technical innovations into an existing landscape. Second, “new proposition innovation” of BMI is driven by the emergence of new markets and sales channels, requiring organizations to adapt their internal and external communication processes (Needleman et al. 2021). The introduction of new products and services through BMI necessitates changes to the existing strategy of a company, which entails modifying both the technical implementations and process structures simultaneously. Last, the expansion of revenues is a significant driver of BMI in “value capture innovation.”\\n\\nFig. 1 | BMI Categorization (own illustration following Kraus et al.

The advent of AI provides new value-creating opportunities, which necessitates the adoption of techniques that generate new cost streams. This categorization was selected as theoretical basis for this study for three main reasons. First, it integrates widely accepted and recent conceptualizations of BMI (e.g., Clauss 2017; Spieth and Schneider 2015). Second, it provides three condensed categories which build an ideal basis for the analysis of the impact of GAI. Third, it was developed in the context of analyzing BMI implications of another technological advancement, namely metaverse technology. In Sect. 5 of this study, we present the findings considering the outlined categories to clarify the impact of GAI on BMI—both industry overarching and narrowed down to three industry examples.\\n\\n# 3 Development of generative artificial intelligence\\n\\nIt is widely argued that the important question is not if AI will play a role in the future, but rather which role it will take on, and more importantly, how humans can coexist with AI (Haenlein and Kaplan 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand the emergence of this technology. The roots of AI began with the foundational work of Alan Turing in the early 1950s. Turing introduced the notion of machine intelligence, proposing an imitation game to distinguish between human and machine responses (Turing 1950). Despite controversies surrounding the \"Turing test,\" it became a cornerstone for the exploration of the human–machine boundary and remains influential in AI discourse (Haenlein and Kaplan 2019). A decade later, Joseph Weizenbaum introduced the chatbot ELIZA (Weizenbaum 1966) which is considered as pioneering work in the field of natural language processing (NLP) laying the foundation for today’s language models. The following decades further marked the advent of rule-based expert systems, employing predefined rules for output generation within specific domains (Buchanan and Smith 1988). These systems had limited generative capacity and were primarily used in narrow domains. However, their development led to recurrent neural networks for coherent text generation by predicting the probability of next words in a sequence (Marr 2019) and networks for improved pattern recognition (Huang 2023). The early 2000s saw a significant development with the rise of machine learning and deep learning, becoming more effective due to advancements in data availability and computational capabilities (Marr 2019). Driven by the availability of massive data volumes and the increased efficiency of graphics card processors, which drastically accelerated learning algorithms, breakthroughs were made in various areas such as advanced computer vision, speech recognition, image classification, and the ability to construct 3D scenes and assets out of 2D images (House 2019; Krizhevsky et al. 2017; Yoo et al. 2021). Based on these advancements, a recent progress in GAI are transformer-based LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) (OpenAI and Pilipiszyn 2021). Those GAI tools emerged rapidly in the public attention but have been in development for years and the release of GPT-2 in 2019 already marked the beginning of GAI’s power to unleash vast economic and societal transformation (Toews 2023). As of 2023, numerous GAI tools are available focusing on different tasks including for example the generation of text, image,', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='1cc9ccbd-7116-4996-a133-3b75254f4de6', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='D. K. Kanbach et al.\\n\\nvideo, audio, and code. Midjourney, for example, offers a text-to-image generator through the messenger-service Discord and a web app (Midjourney 2023). In addition to the seemingly omnipresent LLM from OpenAI, named Chat-GPT, Bard is another conversational GAI, powered by Google’s LLM “LaMDA” (Pichai 2023). Like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it was trained on a massive dataset and can be used to generate text, translate languages, create various kinds of content, and answer questions in an informative manner. Bard has been used in a variety of scientific applications, including data analysis, experiment design, literature review, and scientific writing. Despite Bard’s seemingly hasty release to rival ChatGPT, Google had already pioneered LLM development by publicly sharing its transformer deep learning model back in 2017.\\n\\nThe field has come a long way, from the early days of simple text creation to the complex and sophisticated application use cases seen today. The development of GAI today is marked by further advancements in algorithms and techniques that enable a generation of new and original content. Although these recent advancements are still far away from artificial general intelligence in which systems are capable of human-like behavior in all aspects, encompassing cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence, businesses in all industries should not neglect these developments. It is widely argued that we are entering a new era that will revolutionize how we obtain information, generate content, cater to consumer demands, and operate businesses (Daugherty et al. 2023).\\n\\n# 4. Methodology and data\\n\\n# 4.1 Approach\\n\\nTo gain an overview of the actual landscape in the field of GAI, we conducted a scoping review and categorized the publications and sources with a qualitative content analysis. The primary aim of this paper is to provide an initial understanding of the potential implications of GAI for BMI. Due to the novelty and rapid development of this technology, we employed a systematic scoping review method, incorporating scientific as well as non-scientific sources, to ensure the inclusion of developments on the forefront of the scientific as well as public discourse. More specifically, we followed a PRISMA-ScR, which ensures consistent reporting items by identifying, pre-selecting, checking the suitability, and finally deciding to include or exclude a source, as proposed by Tricco et al. (2018). In line with Kraus et al. (2022a) and Sauer and Seuring (2023), we conducted a systematic sampling technique involving a structured process for data collection to enhance our study’s reproducibility and transparency. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we additionally enriched the scientific sources with non-academic sources, including articles, books, pre-prints, press statements, and company websites, in addition to publicly available information such as podcasts, interviews, or event recordings capturing industry leaders’ opinions, as also applied by other scoping reviews analyzing recent emerging phenomena (e.g., Cheong et al. 2022; Murphy et al. 2021; Syrowatka et al. 2021). For the content analysis of the identified sources, we', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='6735f1fd-b4c3-4de4-a9c7-19e7779d9fb4', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\n# 4.2 Sample selection\\n\\nWe conducted a comprehensive search of databases, including EBSCO, Science-Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The data collection processes were conducted from March 15th to April 30th, 2023. The initial approach of the search scope resulted in targeting publications with the terms “business model (innovation)” and “generative AI” within either title or abstract. However, we realized that the combination of those terms is not sufficient for the analysis, and so we chose a broader approach, enhanced with manual selection and the precise narrowing down of the research funnel. Therefore, we opted for a dual search strain approach, completed by the inclusion of non-academic sources (see Fig. 2 for details).\\n\\nIn the first strain, we searched for “generative AI” terms (including spelling variations such as “Generative AI”, “Generative Artificial Intelligence”, “GAI”, “GenAI”) which resulted in 2845 hits in EBSCO. Narrowing this down further based on the exclusion of publications older than 2022 and additionally filtering for peer-reviewed publications resulted in 234 hits. The same search yielded 145 results from Web of Science, resulting in 26 narrowed down results. In ScienceDirect, this resulted in an initial 4748; again, this was considerably narrowed down to 76 results. Last, the same search conducted in Google Scholar resulted in 3407 hits, reduced by the filter criteria to 166. The total of 502 publications was then reduced by excluding duplications and manually removing publications that (a) did not match the topic; (b) were solely IT-focused (e.g., explaining the training of the datasets); and (c) that were not in English (if not already filtered automatically beforehand). This led to 143 publications.\\n\\nThe second search strain was conducted with specific companies and concrete applications, including “OpenAI,” “ChatGPT” (and its variations), “DALL-E,” “Midjourney,” “Jasper,” “StableAI,” and “Google Bard”. These specific GAI applications and companies were selected following Forbes’ AI 50 list by selecting companies which were additionally listed in the Market Insights report of Statista (Cai 2023; Senn-Kalb and Metha 2023), to ensure the inclusion listing of relevant applications and companies on the forefront of the public as well as scientific.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='0e45debf-7498-4843-a708-c900bf3d5798', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# D. K. Kanbach et al.\\n\\n# Fig. 1\\n\\nPRISMA-ScR for this paper’s publication selection (own illustration following Tricco et al. (2018))\\n\\nFurthermore, we cross-referenced the actuality and importance by studying Google Trends in AI from September 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023 and hereby added more relevant companies, e.g., DALL-E. Given the rapid development of the technology, it is not possible to include all tools, services, and even companies who have launched GAI applications, but at the time of research we covered the most intensely discussed ones following (non-) scientific literature and AI trends in search engines by excluding the ones that do not concentrate on creating content (like text, audio, or video). This resulted in 40,045 hits in EBSCO; filtering for results only in 2022–2023, peer-reviewed, only including English results, and removing false hits.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='f85f2aee-a6d1-4569-b6f5-fd7b85d2d4fc', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\nled to 796 hits. In the ScienceDirect database, the same search led to an initial 4748 results, which was narrowed down to 505 hits. Applying the same search terms and mechanics for Web of Science resulted in 13,740 hits, narrowed down to 115 by applying the specific search criteria. All these results demonstrated a clear tendency of most of the publications to focus on ChatGPT as the most prominent application of GAI. Again, excluding duplicates and solely IT-focused publications and publications with a non-topic related focus led to 267 publications. This added up overall to 410 academic resources from the two search strains for further analysis.\\n\\nThird, to stay true to the multifaceted approach to gathering relevant information from diverse sources and given the rapid development of the topic beyond academia, we conducted a keyword search using two prominent search engines, namely Google and Bing. The search results incorporated information from sources such as reports, articles, podcasts, interviews, and insights from industry experts, including consultancies. Given the number of sources, this last screening process was not conducted in an extensive, all-encompassing manner. Searching for the relevant terms in Google alone led to over 75,000 hits. Nevertheless, we included publications in renowned (online) news outlets and industry-related reports, such as Forbes, New York Times, Gartner, McKinsey, and Bain. We defined renowned news as articles from trustworthy companies and news outlets (see Glader 2017 for an overview). Additionally, we rely on the selected AI tools and companies’ websites due to their reputable standing in the field.\\n\\n# 4.3 Descriptive results\\n\\nThe research protocol described above yielded a total of 513 data points classified into two clusters (a) data obtained from academic journal publications (n = 410), and (b) data acquired from non-academic sources, such as online newspapers and online repositories of the companies that have developed GAI (n = 103). GAI in general is a topic of great interest across various domains, industries, and research disciplines. The versatility of GAI has made it applicable to seemingly every domain. In particular, the recent hype and spike in research are based on the advancements in the technology and access to large datasets and computing resources, which have resulted in improved GAI algorithms with intuitive operating interfaces and handling. The vast applications of the technology have fueled research interest in it almost as rapidly as the increase in investments in AI companies.\\n\\nFirst, we screened and categorized the sources based on the type of GAI mentioned within the publication. In line with Aydin and Karaarslan (2023), we again classified the types of GAI as “text to…” text, image, video, audio, or code. In this way, each category is reflective of the use of GAI based on a prompted written command and differentiated between the type of output generated, namely the beforehand mentioned five categories. While screening the sources it was searched for the main focus type of GAI of the publication and multiple counts are included, as the majority of sources concentrated on more than one type of GAI. In addition, data analysis is added as a general category to describe the use of GAI in analytical capacities, varying from, for example, drug discovery (Chen 2021; Patronov et al.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='5944035b-234a-4a3e-b800-b5aba9e7bba8', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='D. K. Kanbach et al.\\n\\n(2022) and data analytics in business education and research (Cribben and Zeinali 2023) to data interpretation to counter global warming (Biswas 2023a). The distribution across the different categories is thereby not mutually exclusive. Table 1 presents the exact distribution of the types of GAI in the sample.\\n\\nMoreover, we examined the industry context in which GAI is mentioned. Again, the results of the screening are not mutually exclusive and, frequently, multiple industries were mentioned in one publication or none. Table 2 shows the most frequently included industries, starting with “healthcare” (95), followed by “education” (92) and “media, creative, and journalism” (51). In addition, “academic research” included 142 sources; 128 were industry “unspecified” and multiple industries, with fewer than ten counts excluded in this overview, ranging from agriculture (Biswas 2023b; Wiles 2023) to tourism and hospitality (Carvalho and Ivanov 2023; Erul and Isin 2023). Moreover, the conscious decision to exclude purely technical publications from the data set does not imply that we disregarded software engineering. In fact, most of the papers included a perspective into how new software solutions could influence their respective area of study.\\n\\nAs the data analysis demonstrates, the remarkable progress of GAI, especially in natural language understanding and content generation, has undoubtedly prompted the interest of researchers and practitioners. The analysis further shows that research regarding GAI varies widely in its focus, (technological) depth, and methodology, in addition to whether GAI will result in beneficial effects or if the negative consequences will prevail. The research types vary from short, explorative papers commenting on chat interview protocols, setting the output of mainly ChatGPT into context (Biswas 2023a; Du et al. 2023a; Iskender 2023; Lund and Wang 2023; Neves 2022; Wang et al. 2023a; Wang et al. 2023a), to broad, multidisciplinary perspectives on a variety of topics, implications and industry analysis, primarily conducted by research collectives (e.g., Dwivedi et al. 2023). In addition, other studies and publications focus on overarching topics, for example ethical discussions (e.g., Motoki et al. 2023; Youvan 2023; Zhuo et al. 2023).\\n\\n# 5 Generative artificial intelligence implications for business model innovation\\n\\nThis chapter introduces a macro-level analysis of technology’s impact on business model innovation, focusing on the implications of GAI.

Building on our sample, we derive six propositions to provide an initial view of GAI´s capabilities to impact (1) innovation activities, (2) work environment, and (3) information infrastructure. Based on the outlined BMI categories (Kraus et al. 2022b), we discuss the potential of GAI impact in three specific industries (see Fig. 3).\\n\\n# Proposition I—Initiators of Innovations\\n\\nGAI levels the playing field for innovators from all regions and social backgrounds by providing access to expertise, technology, and resources.\\n\\nThe first experiences with GAI demonstrate in many business areas that holding specific knowledge becomes a less important factor in work and innovation success. For example, a study conducted by Noy and Zhang (2023) indicates that the disparity among employees diminishes as ChatGPT narrows the productivity distribution by providing greater benefits to workers with lower abilities, ergo leveling the playing field (Noy and Whitney 2023). GAI democratizes prior knowledge by evening out educational disadvantages, language discrepancies, and individual handicaps (see, e.g., Gimpel et al. 2023). A very precise application of this is provided by Yue et al. (2023) as they examine the possibility of utilizing Explainable AI and large language models, such as ChatGPT, to transfer financial knowledge to individuals without financial backgrounds (Yue et al. 2023). The study rests upon experimentation and demonstrates that ChatGPT has significant potential as a resource for conveying multifaceted financial concepts to diverse target groups.\\n\\nBeyond knowledge accessibility, GAI theoretically provides technology and resources to almost everybody. For example, it not only assists in writing code (knowledge), but it can also run it no matter how resource-intense the execution is or how expensive the appropriate software tool is. CTO of Microsoft Kevin Scott describes another example of how new AI tools are democratizing access.\\n\\nFig. 3 Propositions of GAI’s impact on businesses (own illustration)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='d0f599b2-2527-4c3e-b13b-02804798f195', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\nto design: “An AI system such as DALL-E 2 doesn’t turn ordinary people into professional artists, but it gives a ton of people a visual vocabulary that they didn’t have before—a new superpower they didn’t think they would ever have. […] The applications of GAI are potentially endless, limited only by one’s ability to imagine scenarios in which productivity-assisting software could be applied to complex cognitive work, whether that be editing videos, writing scripts, designing new molecules for medicines, or creating manufacturing recipes from 3D models” (Scott 2023). Consequently, fewer hardware investments are required, democratizing access to technology.\\n\\nTo conclude, GAI has the potential to shift more of the focus on creativity and the uniqueness of ideas irrespective of a person’s regional or social background—truly leveling the playing field.\\n\\n# Proposition II—Degree of Innovations:\\n\\nGAI’s sweet spot lies in business models that rest upon a combination of factual knowledge and creative thinking. This is where the potential for fast new proposition innovations and value capture innovations is highest.\\n\\nMuch is currently being written about how many repetitive, fixed-knowledge activities can be automated by GAI (e.g., product descriptions, categorizing, writing code), and the opportunities GAI opens to get creative (e.g., writing stories, creating image ads, generating video clips). However, our analysis shows that the greatest potential of GAI for business model innovation now lies between factual knowledge and creative thinking. This follows from two factual statements.\\n\\nFirst, repetitive activities are mostly already inexpensive, either because they are performed by a less skilled workforce or because they are already partially automated (see, e.g., Kagermann 2015). Thus, on this side of the spectrum, the business case is not very strong. Second, although we do observe high-value creation in extremely creative business areas (e.g., art, film, photography), this commercial success depends only partly on the craftsmanship of creativity. More decisive for success is usually the story’s ability to resonate with the audience (e.g., Wieczerzycki and Deszczyński 2022). GAI certainly offers the potential to move into this area soon, but for now, it remains difficult to imagine that the next best-selling book, the next blockbuster movie, or even the next multi-million-dollar painting will be generated solely via GAI. In any case, commercial success in this area remains harder to predict and uncertain (see, e.g., Berg 2022).\\n\\nHowever, this is different for business models that are based on the combination of complex knowledge and creative solution orientation. The workforce in such businesses is more expensive and rarer, whereas the working approaches are still fairly rule-based. Examples are lawyers, auditors, notaries, consultants, software engineers, architects, doctors, and therapists. Frequently, these are also the areas where, traditionally, the cost of making errors is very high and expert responsibility is key (e.g., the audit of financial statements or notaries carrying the risk of a contract’s inaccuracy). It is worth mentioning that GAI or the companies behind it do not assume this responsibility by default. In fact, it remains an open question for the future whether GAI can ever do this. Nonetheless, from a value creation perspective, this is the area where GAI’s impact can be maximized—by removing the bottleneck of the most demanded knowledge workers first.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='0a1d0424-99ca-4ccb-8523-193406c4a75d', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Proposition III—Timing of Innovation:\\n\\nGAI affects most businesses via the extension of existing products and services as readily attainable innovations are prioritized.\\n\\nThe impact of GAI on new offerings will most likely be significant and shall not be underestimated. As Przegalinska and Jemielniak (2023) argue, the shift towards embracing GAI will lead to new offerings and business models which cannot yet be imagined. However, many current offerings are clearly enhanced by adding GAI.\\n\\nMany businesses embrace the integration of GAI into their existing products and services. This approach focuses on incremental changes that improve user experience, making products more accessible, efficient, and streamlined. This approach can be observed from the releases of, for example, Adobe 2023; Canva 2023; GitHub 2023a; Microsoft 2023; Sean 2023; Spataro 2023. These large corporations did not revamp their complete software product suites but rather prioritized readily attainable innovation and integration. This approach allows businesses to experiment with the technology, refine its applications, and learn from valuable user feedback. It also enables companies to leverage their established brand, distribution channels, and customer base, thus mitigating the risks associated with the introduction of entirely new products and creating a lock-in effect. In this manner, the more GAI is integrated, the more they are put in a position of power to potentially increase their pricing for “smarter” software products. This also implies higher entry barriers for smaller, new market players. As the maturity of GAI progresses, business will potentially be better positioned to develop and launch novel products and services, instead of making existing offerings “just” faster. Although there are initial examples emerging, these new offerings will potentially disrupt market dynamics more drastically by leveraging the technology to a larger degree and ultimately replacing human input in various capacities.\\n\\nThis already observable tendency will most likely have various BMI implications with the adoption of new, AI-powered services and features in existing products, helping companies to advance their offerings. In addition, the newly added features, which will result in an eased user experience, can potentially enable new customers to be targeted, which—in the case of graphic design tools—suddenly requires fewer skills (Agrawal, Gans and Goldfarb, 2022). Overall, customer relationships can be strengthened, and lock-in effects can be created via even more features and smarter, more intuitive solutions which are valued by customers. Lastly, value capture innovation, new pricing, and a potentially altered cost structure will be possible after the roll-out of even more GAI features in existing products. However, the sole implementation of additional features will most likely not result in a completely new revenue model. As the example of (corporate) software adding those smart features makes clear, subscription-based models remain their go-to solution.\\n\\n# Proposition IV—Impact:\\n\\nGAI has its highest impact on the jobs of white-collar knowledge workers, for whom entire job roles will be replaced, reshaped, or elevated.\\n\\nThe effects of GAI on the labor market are estimated to be substantial. Recently, Goldman Sachs predicted that 300 million jobs could be affected by AI (Kelly 2023) and Accenture found that 40% of all working hours may be impacted by LLMs such as GPT-4 (Daugherty et al. 2023).

According to Cardon et al. (2022), the anticipated AI revolution is based on three observable tendencies: the integration of GAI into core products by major software vendors, rapid user adoption of AI tools, and the continuous release of new AI applications. Particularly higher-income jobs with advanced language and communication skills are at greater risk of exposure to AI-driven disruption (Felten et al. 2023). More specifically, GAI tools have the potential to replace or reshape numerous jobs. Noy and Whitney (2023) find that ChatGPT primarily serves as a replacement for employee effort, shifting tasks towards idea generation and editing. Particularly affected jobs will be those with highly repetitive tasks, for example, data entry clerks, customer service representatives, proofreaders, paralegals, and bookkeepers (Mok and Zinkula 2023; Schafer 2023; Zhang et al. 2023). However, the situation is not entirely bleak. GAI also creates new jobs as demonstrated by the increase in open position postings related to (generative) AI tasks (Tarrant 2023). In addition, the rise of GAI offers opportunities to elevate existing professions, for example customer service jobs (Daugherty et al. 2023). By examining how white-collar workers spent their workday, GAI could enable them to devote their time to more advanced cognitive tasks, profoundly altering the way they engage with technology to accomplish tasks (Scott 2023). This would not only potentially enhance customer relationships by offering more efficient customer-service (e.g., 24/7), but simultaneously reshape processes through streamlined workflow and the elimination of repetitive tasks, allowing employees to, for example, focus on meaningful customer interaction or creativity-related tasks. One hypothesis is that by automating tasks, workers in, for example, care-related jobs—which are currently often undervalued and underpaid—can free up time for human-related tasks (Gupta 2022). This could potentially result in a more balanced and fulfilling labor market, with a greater focus on social priorities due to the additional time that was previously spent on repetitive tasks. The outcome will most likely be one of two scenarios: increased efficiency or reduced working hours. In the first scenario, the increased efficiency of white-collar workers results in a higher output with similar working hours. In the second scenario, workers produce the same output in less time, leading to a reduction of working hours (Rees 2023). Both scenarios raise questions about the future structure of the workday, compensation, and overall implications for the labor market. This potential change in output can result in a range of consequences, from small efficiency gains and potential cost reductions due to a smaller necessary workforce to a complete shift of how society operates, for example.\\n\\n# Proposition V—Skill Set:\\n\\nGAI redefines the skill set required to generate content as many job roles transform from creators to editors—human amplification and not complete substitution.\\n\\nThe use of AI is transforming the required skillset of employees (Santana and Díaz-Fernández 2022). The rapid development of GAI is transforming the landscape of content production and impacting the capabilities of both companies and their employees. Content production is meant in the broadest sense as generating media output from given input. This transformation is causing a paradigm shift in the human role within the creative process. Traditionally, humans have been the primary', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='26f589ff-31f8-4acc-8145-2694b4a0956d', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='creators of content. There was no possibility—especially not a publicly accessible one—of generating (high-quality) ideas and shaping them into consumable forms without manual labor. The rise of GAI has challenged this idea, prompting a revolution of the human role in content production. GAI gives content creators powerful tools, erasing the entry barriers to many jobs (Towson 2023). GAI tools have already significantly reduced the marginal cost of content creation (OpenAI 2023). These algorithms generate vast amounts of content with minimal human input. Workers’ skillsets can and must therefore adapt to deliver value in the generating content process. Individuals should evaluate the quality and relevance of the seeming abundance in a world with a zero-marginal content cost (Noy and Whitney 2023). Therefore, one of the most critical skills in this new paradigm is judgment (Fridman 2019). The ability to discern good from mediocre or irrelevant content becomes paramount. This emphasis on curation necessitates the development of critical thinking, analytical, and evaluative skills, enabling individuals to assess the value, resonance, and impact of AI-generated content—a task that cannot yet be automated. In addition, these skills empower individuals to mold and refine the generated content, aligning it with the intended purpose and audience. The integration of GAI in content production offers new capabilities and the potential for increased effectiveness when employed correctly. By leveraging AI-generated content, individuals can focus on refining and tailoring the output to suit specific needs, thus enhancing its overall efficiency. In this manner, the collaboration between GAI and humans has the potential to unlock unprecedented levels of creativity and productivity. As Mostaque, the CEO of StabilityAI, euphorically predicted, “with AI we figured out how to make humans scale” (Goldman Sachs 2023). Time will tell if this prediction becomes reality. Overall, it can be summarized that GAI’s anticipated ability to decrease the marginal cost of content production could lead to significant business model innovations along the whole value chain, enabling companies to create and capture value in new ways. This will begin with small achievements which make existing tasks quicker with the new capabilities to completely new processes, and lastly, entirely new revenue models. The integration of GAI could unlock innovative revenue models by capitalizing on its capacity to augment human creativity and decrease content production costs, ultimately promoting value capture and business growth. This would work, for example, by differentiation between freemium and premium content: By employing GAI to produce high-quality content cost-effectively, businesses can offer basic content for free and reserve exclusive, personalized content for paying customers.\\n\\n# Proposition VI—Consume or Customize:\\n\\nIt is not a question of if GAI will be used by companies but how it will be built or integrated into the company’s data infrastructure.\\n\\nAs GAI becomes increasingly pervasive, companies should decide how to adapt their processes to harness this technology’s potential. Przegalinska and Jemielniak (2023) argue that every company must embrace AI technology or risk obsolescence. Consequently, companies face the question of how to use this new technology appropriately. They have three overarching opportunities: utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs; customizing models for specific use cases (independently or with external assistance, e.g., consultancies or technology providers such as Google, NVIDIA, or', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='853c6144-e047-4b1f-b7aa-d1ad57ec4ef2', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\nMicrosoft); creating their own LLMs, or a combination of the former (Daugherty et al. 2023; Pounds 2023). Key factors in this decision include mitigating the risk of proprietary data leakage and balancing the potentially large costs of training and inference with the anticipated benefits. In addition, especially regarding BMI and the required adaptation to a changing environment, time-to-market is a crucial factor. Pre-trained, existing LLMs offer the fastest deployment, followed by the customization of models, whereas in-house development of an own model may take longer to fully implement. Furthermore, off-the-shelf LLMs are accessible and easy to deploy, even for non-experts, allowing employees to integrate GAI into various business areas, such as marketing or customer-facing processes (Dwivedi et al. 2023). However, as businesses require more specialized solutions, customization becomes increasingly important. Customized models demand higher investment and capabilities, but potentially enable deeper process innovation and differentiation in the long run. Security and data concerns are paramount when adopting GAI technology. Third-party providers address these concerns by offering separate instances for different tenants to prevent data leakage. The full scope of business process disruption remains uncertain, but it is likely to affect every industry. Third-party providers facilitate the use of customized GAI solutions as opposed to using pre-trained models such as GPT-4 directly via API. One example is Epic’s implementation of Chat-GPT in the healthcare sector (Microsoft News Center 2023). Ultimately, the choice between adopting an existing GAI or building a company specific LLM will significantly impact the organization’s data structure and setup. Consequently, this will impact the company’s differentiation and value creation, and can be a success factor when it comes to constantly innovating the business model and staying relevant.\\n\\n# 5.2 Industry case studies\\n\\nIn line with the BMI categories, we analyze potential GAI implications for the sectors software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. With new technologies as a key factor in the reconfiguration of business models (Clauss 2017), the integration of GAI in various use cases and capacities will undisputedly alter many industries, the question is to what extent. The following analysis focuses on the degree to which three selected industries will be changed, from incremental improvements and efficiency gains to completely new revenue and business models. In these examples, we discuss the potential impact of GAI on business models, following the logic of three underlying categories—value creation innovation, new proposition innovation, and value capture innovation—with respective sub-categories, as described in Sect. 2. Along these categories, we provide examples to demonstrate the varying degrees of change that can potentially be caused by GAI in the future—or those that are already visible today. Revisiting the previously discussed six propositions, the extent of the expected influence on the business model components exhibits a broad range. The presented industry examples serve as explanatory demonstrations of the application of the BMI categories and basis for transfer to further industries. Therefore, the industries have been selected in a way to cover a great variety of different sectors with varying use cases for GAI. The first one depicts software engineering,', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='cad78fdd-8713-4361-abf1-4e816891de35', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 5.2.1 Case study #1 software engineering\\n\\nThrough automated code generation, documentation, bug detection, and performance optimization, GAI is predicted to impact the software engineering landscape (Greymatter 2023a, b; Baker 2023). Already today, Stable AI’s CEO, Mostaque, notes that 41% of new GitHub code is AI-generated (Goldman Sachs, 2023b). Google recently made headlines by stating that ChatGPT could hypothetically pass interviews to be hired as an entry-level software engineer, citing internal Google sources (Elias 2023). Through cloud-based platforms and online offerings, the sector could become more accessible to non-technical users. Entrepreneurs on the forefront of GAI development foresee that developers will become more like product managers, specifying, customizing, and editing rather than coding themselves. This could trigger a change in developers’ work, from writing code to strategic decision making (Brady 2023), with some calling the rise of GAI in software engineering a paradigm shift as significant as the cloud or DevOps (Shank and Combs 2023).\\n\\n# 5.2.1.1 Value creation innovation\\n\\nNew capabilities exist already and are predicted to grow further, including automated code generation, error detection, and resolution. Examples include Wolverine.py, which automatically finds errors in Python scripts and fixes them (GitHub 2023a); the performance optimization of existing code and software (Daugherty et al. 2023); or automated documentation writing and translating code from one language to another, helping with legacy migration (Shank and Combs 2023). Moreover, the implementation of GAI makes programming easier and faster overall (Boza 2021). One study found that developers who used GitHub Copilot reported feeling 88% more productive (Kalliamcakou 2022).\\n\\nNew technologies and equipment become prevalent in a shift from traditional computing to large-scale deep learning models, for example NLP as well as other machine learning frameworks. New and adapted processes could be necessary as the friction to start to code disappears (Thompson 2023), challenging the traditional role of distribution in software development. Sprint plannings and product owners as the intermediates between developers and the business stakeholders in agile project setups, as they are typical in especially but not exclusively tech companies, might become less important. GAI is making it possible to write code simultaneously in different languages and for different operating systems (Seshia et al. 2022). Consequently, application development becomes faster and entails lower costs (resulting in cheaper content production, as discussed in proposition III).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='3461b7be-d112-4cac-a234-4256cccf5986', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\n# 5.2.1.2 New proposition innovation\\n\\nNew offerings could be imaginable in the form of AI-powered software development platforms, integrating AI tools for code generation and testing. The reduced entry barrier allows people without a technical background to start coding. Consequently, new offerings could reduce the hurdle faced by new, non-technical developers when starting a project or certain tasks. These non-traditional, AI-enabled developers represent new customers and markets for the software industry. The relationship with customers is shifting as well: developers move forward with new tasks more quickly and are more reliant than ever on their tooling.\\n\\n# 5.2.1.3 Value capture innovation\\n\\nGAI could transform the value cost structure of the software engineering industry by boosting operational efficiency, automating tasks, and reducing overheads—especially for junior developers (Hassan 2023; van Gool 2023)—and enabling more scalable solutions. This could result in reduced costs, optimized resource allocation, and quicker time-to-market, with shorter development cycles and less downtime for developers, thus freeing up time for additional projects. New revenue models could be imaginable, with marketplace solutions for plug-ins and extensions of LLM models, which increase functionalities and data, creating an ecosystem around the GAI APIs.\\n\\n# 5.2.2 Case study #2 healthcare (AI-powered therapies)\\n\\nThere are few sectors in which people are so prone to searching the internet for their problems before consulting an expert. Studies indicate that many individuals research medical symptoms online, or even self-diagnose based solely on online information (Hochberg et al. 2020). Among these search inquiries, mental health issues have been growing (WHO 2022). To counter this expanding need, digital mental health solutions, including AI chatbots, are on the rise (Hamdoun et al. 2023) and consequently the emotional comprehension capabilities of GAI are gaining attention (Uludag 2023). Assuming users’ data privacy is safeguarded, encrypted GAI chatbots can serve as confidants, allowing individuals to share their emotions, or psychological symptoms, and feel heard (Eshghi 2023). By enabling healthcare providers to analyze vast amounts of medical data and make more accurate diagnoses, in addition to making more data-driven decisions, valuable time could be freed up for healthcare providers (Dilmegani 2023; Lin 2023). Through virtual and hybrid concepts, or completely outsourcing tasks to AI-powered bots, therapy could be made accessible to a wider group of patients in the future. However, some experts emphasize that mental health apps should only be used as a supplement to in-person therapy (Wakefield 2023).\\n\\n# 5.2.2.1 Value creation innovation\\n\\nAI-driven diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and virtual mental health support are potential new capabilities with which doctors could provide better-quality care to more patients. New technology and equipment could amplify their work, enabling them to treat more patients by utilizing, for example, NLP powered chatbots, which would act as virtual therapists to pre-diagnose or screen patients or provide 24/7 support (Metz 2023).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='cc7e9af9-25d4-4871-8547-1c876f4b2b78', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 5.2.2.2 New proposition innovation\\n\\nNew offerings and new channels could include AI-powered therapy apps, online mental health support platforms and communities, therapy with virtual reality, or self-help courses with customized topics tailored to the individual needs, all powered with NLP, sentiment analysis, and machine learning. New customers and markets could be reached because of the reduced costs, making healthcare cheaper and more accessible by automating, for example, pre-screening or AI-conducted pre-diagnosis (Greymatter 2023b). In addition, new customer relationships might be formed with more autonomous and informed patients, who can monitor their own condition better and provide valuable feedback and actual data (e.g., with smart wearables combined), thus enhancing the therapy’s success.\\n\\n# 5.2.2.3 Value capture innovation\\n\\nIncreasing numbers of pay-per-session and subscription-based models have appeared in recent years (e.g., Stanford therapy chatbot or Woebot Health). AI-powered mental health solutions will most likely decrease costs drastically and thereby enable a broader patient group to access the services. A freemium model is imaginable in which some services and assistance, for example via chat, are free, whereas consultations with a human doctor are charged. Value cost structure can be impacted through efficiency gains, reduced overheads, more automation, and the outsourcing of repetitive tasks, meaning that human doctors can shift their focus towards value-adding tasks. In addition, the extended, potentially global reach allows for an unprecedented scalability of services. So, what should we expect? Mental health chatbots, increasingly popular and smart, will most likely provide a discreet, convenient avenue for addressing mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, or stress in the future to a growing target group who require assistance.\\n\\n# 5.2.3 Case study #3 financial services (investment management)\\n\\nGAI has the potential to impact investment management through data analysis, risk assessment, and decision-making (Ko and Lee 2023). By employing sophisticated algorithms to process vast amounts of financial data, GAI could identify patterns, predict market trends, and uncover investment prospects. This would ultimately enhance investment strategies, optimize returns, automate due diligence, and improve portfolio performance (Daugherty et al. 2023).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='dc69b106-2915-4dfa-9401-6384d5b559a9', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\nGAI could help with fraud detection as well as customer-facing tasks such as personalized financial advice in wealth management, for example (Schmidt and Albright 2023). It appears that change is already happening, with new tools such as the IPO prediction software developed by PitchBook (Wiggers 2023); the “ChatGPT of finance,” Finchat; or the launch of Bloomberg’s own 50-billion parameter large language model (Bloomberg 2023). Another example is GPTQuant, a conversational AI chatbot for developing and evaluating investment strategies (Yue and Au 2023). Initial harbingers can be seen in the surge of job postings related to AI in the financial sector: Stanford’s AI Index Report (Maslej 2023) places the AI job postings in the finance industry as the third highest out of all industries. Nonetheless, in an industry where trust is crucial and that is traditionally not an early adopter (Hinkfuss 2023), it is especially necessary to ensure the safe, reliable, and compliant usage of GAI (Lau 2023).\\n\\n# 5.2.3.1 Value creation innovation\\n\\nEnhanced new capabilities, such as AI-driven analytics, could enable firms to uncover patterns and predict market trends, leading to more informed investment decisions. Improved risk assessment through AI-generated insights could support decision-making, whereas AI-driven research could enable better due diligence and risk minimization, ultimately leading to improved work efficiency and reduced working time of analysts (Daugherty et al. 2023). New technologies and equipment integration is also a new reality with the strong interconnection of hardware and AI, as demonstrated by the news that Bloomberg has integrated AI into its famous terminal (Sheikh 2023). New partnerships with AI technology companies could provide direct access to cutting-edge tools, while collaborations with data providers ensure access to financial information. Engaging with regulatory institutions is thereby crucial to guaranteeing that AI-driven investment practices are compliant. Following this hypothesis, new processes would be required to facilitate the adoption of AI in due diligence, risk assessment, and portfolio building. These processes, resulting from new capabilities, can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of investment strategies.\\n\\n# 5.2.3.2 New proposition innovation\\n\\nNew offerings could arise in the form of integrating AI into investment products, leveraging AI-generated insights, or using predictions to optimize returns. AI-powered trading algorithms could analyze and act upon real-time market data, enabling high-frequency and automated trading. Moreover, GAI can be used to detect fraudulent financial transactions by identifying patterns previously hidden to human inspection (Hinkfuss 2023). This can assist financial institutions in identifying and preventing fraudulent activity. Due to the automation of tasks, new customers and new markets could be addressed with the reshaping of cost structures. Personalized investment and wealth management could be offered to a wider audience—not only would high-net-worth individuals have access, but everyone could profit from AI-driven financial planning based on insights into their preferences, financial situation, and needs. As a result of this, the new channels to offer robo-advisory services could potentially be digital—for example, in the form of apps and online platforms. Lastly, all these', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='146dab95-444e-4845-82d2-7a941d9737d0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 5.2.3.3 Value capture innovation\\n\\nNew, or rather slightly altered, revenue models could be envisioned in the form of performance-based fees, contingent on achieving specific benchmarks, thus incentivizing investment managers to leverage AI to maximize client returns. Freemium models could expand the customer base by providing basic AI-driven investment tools free of charge while charging for premium features and services.\\n\\nValue cost structure: As elaborated in new proposition innovation and in line with proposition five, operational efficiency could be enhanced by implementing AI-driven tools for research, risk assessment, due diligence, and portfolio management tasks. This would decrease operational costs with reduced needs for (entry-level) analysts while simultaneously boosting investment outcomes with better decision-making. This potentially also applies to automation, driven by utilizing AI-powered algorithms for tasks such as trading and portfolio rebalancing, which subsequently minimizes human intervention and associated labor costs. Moreover, scalability could potentially be achieved by leveraging AI to efficiently expand the availability of investment management services, accommodating a larger customer base without a significant increase in costs. Customization and personalization, utilizing AI-generated insights, could enable tailored investment strategies and financial advice, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and retention in addition to optimized resource allocation.\\n\\n# 6 Limitations\\n\\nFirst, a limitation with any kind of (generative) AI-related research attempt is the speed of development of the phenomenon. As Coldewey, a writer for TechCrunch, explains: “Writing a report on the state of AI must feel a lot like building on shifting sands—by the time you hit publish, the whole industry has changed under your feet” (Coldewey 2023). However, the continuous advancements in AI technologies and the growing influence of GAI on various industries necessitate an understanding in light of the theoretical concepts of management research. Therefore, our study takes these recent and fast-moving developments and frames them in the theoretical context of BMI, contributing to an understanding of the GAI phenomenon that will stand the test of time. However, with new developments, this view should be extended in future research which empirically analyzes the upcoming business models in this field.\\n\\nSecond, some of the included articles, albeit peer-reviewed, consist of the same structure: A topic is discussed with ChatGPT in a chat format and the authors merely comment and set the output into context. Although this might appear less academic, this type of research provides valuable insights into the practical application of ChatGPT and its outputs. These articles offer real-world examples of how', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='e3b1f0ff-903f-403e-9f4c-e26cdbc51aef', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\nGAI can be used to generate content, and the authors’ commentary helps contextualize its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the inclusion of these articles contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the current state of AI research and demonstrates the diverse range of methodologies employed in the field. Future research can also focus on understanding the implications of GAI on research methodologies by considering academic research as an industry affected by technological developments.\\n\\nThird, as with any type of qualitative scoping review, the methodology possesses certain constraints. Among these is the exclusion of publications in languages other than English and German. Another limitation is the researchers’ subjectivity in defining relevant concepts, aggregated themes, and interpreting the outcomes. Nevertheless, to mitigate subjectivity, we included a four-eye coding approach, whereby two researchers, separately from one another, analyzed the data, and interim results were discussed by the entire team of authors.\\n\\nFourth, the limited scope of the three included industries as case studies poses a selective and not generalizable sample. They were selected to cover a great variety of different sectors with varying use cases for GAI and serve only as explanatory demonstrations of the application of the BMI categories.\\n\\n# 7 Conclusion\\n\\nThis study aims to provide a business model innovation perspective on the increasing phenomenon of GAI. To summarize the findings from the extensive scoping review, GAI is foreseen as significantly impacting business models across industries in the areas of value creation innovation, new proposition innovation, and value capture innovation.\\n\\nRegarding value creation innovation (as detailed especially in proposition I, V, and VI) GAI already facilitates new capabilities, technologies, partnerships, and processes. First, the rapid advancements GAI offers are reshaping information access, content creation, and business operations, allowing freed-up time through automation and the potential restructuring of processes and departments. Second, another potential for business model innovation exists at the intersection of factual knowledge and creative thinking—companies must identify this sweet spot and be aware that if they do not fill it, another player might discover how the new capabilities can be used advantageously. Third, the most visible GAI implementations as of now are efficiency improvements made to existing products and services—often by established corporations that wish to broaden the lock-in effect of their already renowned (software) products. It remains to be seen when the “real” innovation in the form of completely novel products and services will emerge, building something from the ground-up with novel possibilities to think and solve problems with the help of GAI.\\n\\nRegarding new proposition innovation (as elaborated further especially in proposition II, III, and VI), GAI can lead to new offerings, markets, channels, and customer relationships, as seen in, for example, personalized marketing campaigns and enhanced customer service experiences. GAI is expected to have the most significant impact on white-collar knowledge workers, reshaping their roles while', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='3b3625af-3878-40a3-b79c-1805e3704693', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='D. K. Kanbach et al.\\n\\nsimultaneously creating new opportunities. In addition, GAI redefines the skill set required to generate (almost) any type of content, with an increasing focus on critical thinking and evaluative skills—shifting the role of humans from creator to editor.\\n\\nRegarding value capture innovation (as detailed further especially in propositions II, IV, and VI), GAI can drive new revenue models and cost structures, as demonstrated by reduced content production costs and novel monetization strategies—increasing the attractiveness of mass customization and freemium models with decreased marginal costs of content creation.\\n\\nUltimately, GAI will continue to evolve and permeate various industries, pushing the boundaries of what was previously thought possible. As businesses navigate this new landscape, they must adapt to the changing environment, harnessing the power of GAI to enhance their productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. The future success of businesses will also be determined by their ability to embrace GAI technologies and effectively integrate them into their existing frameworks while continually exploring new possibilities for growth and differentiation. The extent of GAI’s influence will depend on each company’s specific context and their willingness to embrace these technologies, with early adopters potentially gaining competitive advantage compared to slower market players. GAI and LLMs will undoubtedly optimize tasks, enhance human abilities, and enable enterprise reinvention—to which degree remains to be seen. However, it is clear that the rise of GAI presents a paradigm shift in the manner businesses operate and innovate. GAI has the ability to democratize access to knowledge, and capabilities to create content with zero marginal costs, thereby leveling the playing field for access to resources.\\n\\nHowever, amid all the praise and promises of the new technology, the rapid growth of GAI presents significant challenges. Even the entrepreneurs at the forefront of AI say that caution is required. Altman (OpenAI CEO) stated that he is “(…) worried that these models could be used for large-scale disinformation, now that they’re getting better at writing code, they could be used for offensive cyber-attacks” (Ordonez, Dunn and Noll 2023). Google CEO Pichai warns against rush to deploy AI without oversight and demands “(…) strong regulations to avert harmful effects” (Love 2023) and accentuated that the development of AI should include not just engineers, but social scientists, philosophers and so on, to ensure the alignment with human values and morality (Dean 2023). Some of the main concerns are the following: ethical biases inherently rooted in the data that the large datasets were trained on could reflect historical or societal biases in the GAI such as racial or gender prejudices (Motoki et al. 2023; Youvan 2023; Zhuo et al. 2023), manipulation and disinformation scams intellectual property theft (Yurkevich 2023) and, lastly, the—for now dystopian—idea of a post-humanism area with general AI dominance. All these aspects require consideration, despite the enormous upside potential for innovation. To prevent the propagation of biased AI systems, it is crucial to implement ethical frameworks for AI development—an approach agreed upon by researchers (Goldstein et al. 2023) and companies on the forefront of AI development alike (Google 2023; OpenAI 2018; Meta AI 2023). Transparency, fairness, and inclusivity must be upheld. Mitigating the associated risks will require new policies and laws and the establishment of collaborations between countries, given the technology’s global reach. As of now, regulators often face the challenge of penalizing misuse of GAI.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='6c3d7ac5-7f2f-495b-b1a6-90508da6d6f7', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\\n\\ndue to legal limitations (Dwivedi et al. 2023). To ensure the human-centric focus of AI developments with the necessary degree of oversight and accountability, various institutions (e.g., OECD’s principles on artificial intelligence, OECD.AI 2023) as well as governments (e.g., the ongoing aims to establish new regulations of the US government (Shepardson and Bartz 2023), or the temporary ChatGPT ban issued by the Italian government (Mukherjee et al. 2023)) are currently trying to ensure the uphold of societal values in light of AI’s rapid expansion. As society and businesses alike navigate this complex mix of opportunities and challenges at the advent of this new technology, it becomes apparent that GAI stands to become a game-changer, ready to spark a new era of innovative prowess and entrepreneurial vigor.\\n\\nThis will also impact further research in the management domain. Given the novelty of the topic this study can only provide a first, mainly hypothetical view on how GAI will impact business models and trigger innovations along the value chain of businesses. Therefore, future research endeavors should include empirical approaches, analyzing measurable effects on businesses, with e.g., companies’ performance and/or the degree of measurable business model innovation as the dependent variable of the studies. Additionally, longitudinal study designs are required to understand the evolution of GAI over time and its evolving impact on business models.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.\\n\\n# Data availability statement\\n\\nOur manuscript has no associate data.\\n\\n# Open Access\\n\\nThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

In this context, corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has been a central focus of attention. This paper aims to analyze CSP determinants in Brazil, an important emerging market. Firm CSP is proxied by the membership to the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) which comprises environmental, social, economic and governance issues.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach – Logit panel data models are estimated for a sample of 2,685 firm-year observations in the period of 2006-2015.\\n\\nFindings – Results show that firms operating in environmental risky industries tend to be leading CSP firms in Brazil which might be a positive consequence of the Brazilian environmental legislation that could be forcing such firms to be more committed to environmental issues. High ownership concentration reduces the probability of a firm’s membership to the ISE index signaling that large controlling blockholders may not see sustainability and governance concerns as relevant. Larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities tend to be CSP leaders. Additionally, the financial crisis of 2007-2009 had a negative effect on CSP in Brazil.\\n\\nPractical implications – The implications of the present findings may be of interest to academics and firms’ stakeholders. The fact that firms from environmental risky industries exhibit higher concerns with CSP, probably because of the Brazilian environmental rules that has advanced in the past decades, show the prominence of policymakers in the critical scenario of environmental issues. When designing regulation, policymakers should be conscious of the importance of social issues and pay attention to all ways available to foster firm sustainability concerns. The additional evidence that dominant shareholders do not appear to see CSP as a relevant concern in Brazil points out an agency conflict in which large blockholders’ interests may be prevailing over other stakeholders’ interests. That is important to academics who study the role played by ownership structure on firm’s policies. Furthermore, larger firms, as well as the ones with more growth opportunities, seem to invest in CSP, possibly for seeing it as a way to generate competitive advantage.\\n\\nOriginality/value – As per the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper to point out the relevance of industry environmental sensitivity over firm’s commitment to sustainability issues in Brazil. Additional evidence is provided on the negative effect of ownership concentration on the probability of firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index using a longer period as well as robust logit panel data model estimates compared to previous studies. Unlike previous works, the paper analyzes the complexity of a sustainability index in the Brazilian market. Such index comprises corporate social responsibility, sustainability and corporate governance concerns. This set of concerns makes it a complex index and requires a deeper rationale for the determinants of CSP as proxied by the membership to it, under the stakeholder and agency theoretical frameworks.\\n\\nKeywords Determinants, Brazil, Sustainability index, Corporate social and sustainability performance\\n\\nPaper type Research paper\\n\\n# Authors\\n\\nVicente Lima Crisostomo is Associate Professor at the Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.\\n\\nFatima de Souza Freire is Professor at the University of Brasilia, Brasília, Brazil.\\n\\nMaria Rafaela De Oliveira Freitas is Accountant at Tribunal de Justiça do Estado do Ceará (Ceará State Court) and got her Master degree at Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil.\\n\\n# 1.

This range of stakeholders goes beyond the ones taken into account by the agency theory – shareholders, managers and creditors – and has caused a growing concern for firms about their operation, sustainability and relation with all stakeholders as predicted under the stakeholder theoretical framework. This means that the firm should not only worry about value creation for shareholders but also about the welfare of all social groups and the adequate interaction with the environment (Freeman and Phillips, 2002; Tullberg, 2013).\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) actions and the awareness to sustainability issues as a whole have been considered as able to improve firm’s reputation, with possible benefits on firm’s value, although the results are still inconclusive (Freeman et al., 2004; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Park et al., 2014). In this context, the assessment of corporate sustainability performance (CSP), taking into account environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) concerns, by specialized institutions has become usual, highlighting the importance given to social concerns and long-term sustainability of firms by market institutions (Chen and Nainggolan, 2018; Statman, 2006). The Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBOVESPA which comprises ESG issues of the Brazilian firm was launched in 2005 (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).\\n\\nThe motivating factors that drive corporate sustainability policy at the firm level have been highlighted as an important topic of research that requires additional attention (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007). Undertaking such research in emerging economies has also been highlighted as necessary (Ziegler and Schröder, 2010). In this regard, this work intends to advance research in the emerging markets framework by studying Brazil, an emerging economy with increasing international visibility, characterized by high private benefits of control, high ownership concentration and low protection of minority shareholders which favors the prevalence of controlling shareholders’ interests (Dyck and Zingales, 2004; La Porta et al., 1998). Besides, Brazil has faced some institutional advances in environmental protection in recent decades although there is still much to be done (Tollefson, 2016). Under the Brazilian environmental legislation, Law 10.165/2000 categorized industries’ environmental risk and enforced government environmental control. At this moment, it is important to assess whether these institutional advances observed in the Brazilian environmental legislation have been able to produce effects on the firm level.\\n\\nThis research aims to analyze firm’s attributes that are related to social and sustainability policies of Brazilian firms, focusing on firm’s environmental risk and ownership concentration. In this regard, more recently, ownership structure has been suggested to play a role on firm’s social and sustainability policies because of distinct shareholders’ interests and the diversity in institutional contexts (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007; Li and Zhang, 2010), as well as the environmental risk of firm’s activities (Adams, 2002; Crifo et al., 2015; Hackston and Milne, 1996). Additionally, the study also searches for the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and its eventual recovery in the aftermath.\\n\\nTo achieve this purpose, logistic regression models were estimated for a panel data set of 327 Brazilian listed firms, in a total of 2,685 firm-year observations, in the period of 2006-2015. The annual membership to the ISE of BM&FBOVESPA is used as proxy for higher CSP.\\n\\nThe results show that firm’s membership to an environmental risky industry, according the Brazilian environmental law, is able to improve firm’s CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries are leading CSP firms in Brazil given that they present higher probability to be a component of the ISE sustainability index. The findings also indicate that CSP proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index is adversely affected by high ownership concentration. This reveals the presence of an agency conflict in which dominant shareholders’ interests prevail over CSP, given that the presence of such shareholders lowers the probability that the firm becomes member of the annual Brazilian ISE.

The research builds on stakeholder and agency theories by investigating the possible effect of industry environmental risk and ownership concentration on CSP as proxied by firm’s membership to the Brazilian firm ISE. The study contributes to the literature that deals with firm membership to sustainability indices set by capital markets as a proxy for social and sustainability performance (Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Cris ostomo and Oliveira, 2016; Artiach et al., 2010). Specifically, the paper complements prior studies in the Brazilian market about CSP determinants by taking into account the industry environmental risk, using a larger variety of proxies for ownership concentration, extending the period of study and using panel data methodology that provides even more robust results and allows better analysis on the CSP determinants.\\n\\n# 2. Background and hypotheses\\n\\n# 2.1 The assessment of corporate sustainability\\n\\nLiterature suggests that firms actions related to sustainability are associated with ethical, environmental and economic criteria of a firm’s decision-making process to ensure business continuity, while corporate social policy may be more associated to the willingness of the firm to undertake actions that benefit stakeholders (Van Marrewijk and Werre, 2003). As a whole, corporate social and sustainability concerns integrate business ethics and stakeholder management, being all associated and complementary concepts under development (Sarkar and Searcy, 2016; Carroll and Shabana, 2010). Conceptual questions apart, assessing the degree of attention that a firm directs to social and sustainability concerns is a complex task and there is still no agreement on how it should be done. In fact, there are a variety of measures used in this context trying to adequately evaluate firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).\\n\\nThe assessment of CSP as a whole may take into account firm sustainability, firm social concerns, business ethics, stakeholder management and environmental issues. Specialized institutions have worked on it and created indices that intend to convey information about the level of firms’ CSP (Statman, 2006). Examples of such indices are the ones created by market institutions like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index of the New York Stock Exchange; the FTSE-4Good in the London Stock Exchange; the Johannesburg Index in South Africa; and the Brazilian ISE set up by the Brazilian stock market.\\n\\n# 2.2 The Brazilian corporate sustainability index\\n\\nThe ISE index is a theoretical portfolio, composed by up to 40 firms that are included into it based on an assessment process conducted by the ISE Advisory Committee. This committee is composed by 11 institutions, being headed by the Sa˜ o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) (Cunha and Samanez, 2013; BM&FBOVESPA, 2015). The information used in the assessment process is supplied by the company through a questionnaire. A firm that intends to participate in the ISE assessment process must fulfill the following requirements (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015):\\n\\n- the firm must be among the 200 most traded in the stock market in the past year;\\n- the firm must have been traded in at least 50 per cent of the stock exchange sessions in the preceding year;', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c8e24a94-d94c-4053-bb5c-f774d9a13efd', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='The firm must comply with the criteria endorsed by the ISE Advisory Committee Executive Council.\\n\\nThe ISE assessment process comprises seven areas or axes, related to both CSR and sustainability, distributed along the questionnaire:\\n\\n- The axis “general information” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses how the firm behaves in relation to global agreements and whether the firm publishes social reports.\\n- The axis “nature of the product” (9.5 per cent of the questions) requires information about the risks and damages for human health associated with the firm’s products.\\n- The axis “corporate governance” (17 per cent of the questions) intends to evaluate shareholders relationships and the quality of the firm’s corporate governance system.\\n- The axis “financial-economics” (10 per cent of the questions) captures information about firm’s strategic planning, risk management and financial performance.\\n- The axis “social” (14 per cent of the questions) tries to assess firm’s relations with workers, suppliers and clients.\\n- The axis “climate change” (25 per cent of the questions) appraises whether the company is actually committed to policies for climate change prevention.\\n- The axis “environmental” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses firm’s concern with the natural environmental through the analysis of the number of problems with environmental licenses, or criminal prosecution because of environmental crimes.\\n\\nInvited firms respond the ISE questionnaire in a voluntary manner. Firm assessment is based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis is based on the questionnaire score, in which all CSP axes have the same weight, with specific criteria and indicators in each axis. The qualitative analysis is based on the checking of supporting documents that are also requested from companies. Then, cluster analysis is run with the purpose of identifying groups of firms with similar CSP and make up firm ranking to compose the ISE portfolio that integrates up to the 40 best performing firms (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).\\n\\n# 2.3 Determinants of corporate sustainability performance\\n\\nThe determinants of CSP are analyzed under distinct theoretical frameworks. Some firm’s attributes have been seen as able to affect CSP. Among such factors are, for example, firm size, profitability and leverage. More recently, agency conflicts, firm industry environmental risk as well as growth opportunities have also been considered.\\n\\nThere is evidence that ownership structure moderates agency conflicts among the main firm stakeholders. For instance, agency conflicts between shareholders and managers are moderated by ownership structure (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997).\\n\\nFurthermore, there is evidence that ownership structure matters for firm value and performance as well as for firm strategic and financial policies (Allen and Phillips, 2000; Goergen and Renneboog, 2001; Schiantarelli and Sembenelli, 2000). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that ownership structure may also influence firm’s sustainability policy (Aguilera et al., 2007).\\n\\nResearch in different markets signals that ownership structure characteristics may matter for firm’s sustainability policy, under distinct arguments, although with inconclusive results (Faller and zu Knyphausen-Aufseß, 2016). For example, there is a positive effect of high firm ownership concentration in hands of the main shareholder on CSR in Spain (Godos Dı´ez et al., 2012). Equity ownership held by individual shareholder types has also received special attention. Institutional investors have a positive effect on CSR in USA.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='8272ea89-808f-43cd-8c2b-8e2eafa5ae12', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='(Harjoto and Jo, 2008). Government ownership favors CSR in Singapore and Malaysia (Eng and Mak, 2003; Said et al., 2009). In USA, internal ownership has a negative impact on CSR (Barnea and Rubin, 2010) and non-state ownership has an adverse effect on CSR in China (Li and Zhang, 2010). In Europe, ownership concentration held by the main shareholder is also detrimental to CSR (Lopez-Iturriaga and Lopez-de-Foronda, 2011). Ownership structure playing a role on firm’s policies is closely linked to the agency theory given that its influence may raise or minimize agency conflicts.\\n\\nFirm controlling shareholders, who are common in high ownership concentrated firms, are interested in improving firm reputation which may be obtained from social and sustainability policies according to the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical approaches (Chiu and Sharfman, 2011). Thus, they may use social and sustainability policy to achieve this goal by prioritizing social and sustainability elements that may be more favorable to their purpose.\\n\\nHigh concentrated ownership, frequently associated to a reduced number of controlling shareholders, may promote the exacerbation of private benefits of control (Riyanto and Toolsema, 2008) and may also be detrimental to the adoption of good corporate governance practices under the argument that controlling shareholders benefit from weaker corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Bozec and Bozec, 2007; Renders and Gaeremynck, 2012).\\n\\nSustainability indices, as is the case of ISE in Brazil, have corporate governance as a very relevant component as mentioned above (Section 2.2). In this context, high ownership concentration may also be negative to public firm accountability that tends to improve with a decrease in ownership concentration and more shareholders pressuring for better firm accountability in the opposite direction of high ownership concentration (Li and Zhang, 2010).\\n\\nAlthough stakeholders theorists claim the value creation capacity of social and sustainability performance, such capacity for value creation is still uncertain (Husted and Allen, 2007). This doubtful value creation capacity of firm’s social and sustainability activities may discourage controlling shareholders to undertake social and sustainability policies. Besides, corporate governance which is not a priority for dominant blockholders is really important in the ISE sustainability index. Thus, it seems plausible to propose the hypothesis that dominant shareholders of the Brazilian firm are looking for private benefits of control and do not prioritize the improvement of firm sustainability in its entirety. This rationale leads to the proposal that voting ownership concentration is negative to CSP as proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index in the following terms:\\n\\n# H1.\\n\\nOwnership concentration has an adverse effect on the probability of the firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index which signals firm CSP.\\n\\nFirm’s commitment to social and sustainability issues have been proposed to be favorable to firm’s image and reputation under the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical frameworks (Bebbington et al., 2008; Michelon, 2011). Nowadays, environmental concerns are relevant for firm’s external valuation, and this reality has motivated more complete firm sustainability disclosure (Crifo et al., 2015; Bouten et al., 2011). In fact, empirical research has proposed and found evidence on the influence that environmental activities have on corporate reputation (D’Souza et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2012).\\n\\nFirms from environmental risky industries have more complex relation with the natural environment and external stakeholders tend to be more focused on such firms’ concerns on environmental issues (Hackston and Milne, 1996; Adams, 2002; Patten, 2002; Campbell, 2003). Because of this higher vulnerability to environmental concerns and pressure from stakeholders, firms with activities that are more aggressive to the natural environment will try to signal stakeholders that they follow adequate sustainable practices through adequate sustainability disclosure (Campbell, 2003; Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009; Dyduch and Krasodomska, 2017).\\n\\nIn Brazil, it is important to evaluate the role played by firm industry environmental risk on CSP, given the raising relevance devoted to this issue since the enactment of important legal instruments. It is important to mention the Brazilian Environmental Policy Law 6,938/1981 (revised by Law 10,165/2000), and the Brazilian Constitution/1988 are influential legal', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='d5396531-4b4d-4156-8e04-ad3775b1d90a', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='instruments that highlighted the importance of firm environmental concerns. Both these influential legal instruments highlighted the importance of firms’ environmental concerns. The enactment of Law 10.165/2000 was a threshold for firms’ environmental concerns in Brazil by stratifying firm industry under environmental risk layers (low, medium and high), establishing the Control and Environmental Inspection Fee for all firms from stratified sectors, and also by compelling stratified firms to report annual activities to the government.\\n\\nFirm’s relation with the government and with the natural environment is crucial under the stakeholder theoretical framework. Thus, together with increasing social pressures, Brazilian institutional setting has faced advances in environmental legislation to impose stricter rules on firms in relation with the natural environment. The advances in legal rules, associated with local and international social pressures, tend to force firms to be more committed to environmental, social and sustainability issues which may also be reflected in the search for higher CSP and positive visibility through the presence in sustainability indices as proposed in the following hypothesis:\\n\\n# H2.\\n\\nFirms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\\n\\nThe stakeholder theory proposes the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm performance under the rationale that social responsibility actions are able to create value for the firm because society has a positive sensitivity to this type of corporate action (Freeman et al., 2004; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Stakeholder theorists indeed contend that under the perspective that the firm must be concerned with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, the company must look for maximizing not only shareholders’ interests but also all other stakeholders’ interests, which may be achieved through the commitment to ESG issues that are related to a wider range of stakeholders. They advocate that such commitment is able to foster the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm’s performance.\\n\\nIn fact, prior research on the relationship between CSP and firm profitability has seen it as dynamic with results revealing profitability as a determinant of CSP and also the opposite (Garcia-Castro et al., 2010; McGuirre et al., 1988). Thus, firm’s perspective is expanded by integrating an ethical and responsible conduct (Harrison et al., 2010). Such ethical conduct has been seen as able to improve firm’s image and create value in the mid- and long-run by promoting a virtuous cycle between firm and its stakeholders, favoring firm’s market share and competitive advantage (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).\\n\\nThe argument about the effect of profitability on sustainability is associated with the fact that firms with higher profitability, under the financial slack resources theoretical framework, tend to have more funds available to undertake social and environmental actions (Husted and Salazar, 2006; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Following this argument, it seems appropriate to hypothesize that profitability contributes to higher CSP:\\n\\n# H3.\\n\\nProfitability has a positive effect on CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\\n\\nFirm size has often been suggested as able to moderate firm social and sustainability policies and, indeed, it has been used as an important control variable in this context, although the arguments about the possible effect of firm size on these policies are still controversial (Baumann-Pauly et al., 2013; Orlitzky, 2001; Udayasankar, 2008). It is postulated that larger firms are able to provide more resources to support firm’s social and sustainability policy. Additionally, as the firm becomes larger, it interacts with a wider scope of stakeholders and, this way, experiences greater appeal for ESG concerns. In this vein, such concerns tend to be more relevant to larger firms which are more compelled to follow ethical behavior and integrate better corporate governance practices (Ullman, 1985; Ziegler and Schro¨ der, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013). Following this rationale, we propose that larger firms are more prone to be committed with sustainability issues as summarized in the following hypothesis:', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c92dbc9d-ae73-4c66-86e5-fa524df31721', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Larger firms are more likely to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\\n\\nThere are arguments suggesting that innovation process, which is closely related to growth opportunities, is positive to the firm production system by making it more effective, given that innovation leads to optimizing the consumption of energy and natural resources, and thus reducing its effect on the natural environment. This may lead to better corporate sustainability related to products and processes (Padgett and Galan, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Artiach et al., 2010). Besides, firm’s growth opportunities have been considered to be related to firm’s commitment to sustainability given that the firm needs to signal to the market that it is sustainable to be able to access external funds to seize its growth opportunities. Thus, to better maximize its growth opportunities, which is closely related to innovation process that is beneficial to firm’s sustainability, the firm needs to show that it is committed to sustainability in terms of natural environment concerns, stakeholder management and business ethics, which involves good standards of corporate governance, adequate relations with clients and supply chain and natural environment concerns. This rationale motivates the following hypothesis:\\n\\n# H5. Growth opportunities have a positive influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\\n\\nCreditors are usually effective in pressing for the meeting of their demands, as they finance firm’s investment and need guarantees for the return of their funds. This situation sometimes leads to firm monitoring if the firm increases its indebtedness (Artiach et al., 2010). Thus, in low leveraged firms, creditors exert less pressure over their rights. On the other hand, more indebted firms are more committed to creditor rights. The financial obligations with creditors may lead to reduced slack resources and to lower firm’s capacity to undertake social and sustainability actions which require available funds, constraining the firm to direct funds to CSR activities (Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). These arguments lead to the hypothesis proposal that debt may inhibit firm sustainability policy as follows:\\n\\n# H6. Debt has a negative influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\\n\\n# 3. Empirical research\\n\\n# 3.1 Sample\\n\\nThe sample is composed of 2,685 firm-year observations from 327 firms, covering the period of 2006-2015. The year 2006 corresponds to the first year of the Brazilian Firm ISE. Firms financial and ownership data were obtained from Economatica database. Every firm’s sector was checked in Law 10.165/2000 to categorize each one according to the industry environmental risk. The status of composing the annual ISE, that is the proxy for higher CSP, was collected at the ISE website at BM&FBOVESPA. The sample period is also relevant given that it allows assessing the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and eventual recovery in the aftermath. The whole sample of firms is distributed among several sectors of the economy (Table I). As can be observed in Table I, membership to the ISE seems to attract firms from all industries. It is worth mentioning that three sectors – “Chemicals, paper products, metal-mechanical”, “Financial” and “Electrical, Water supply and sanitary services” – exhibit higher proportions of firms in the ISE than out of it. This can be motivated by characteristics of firms’ interests on positive visibility and also because of industry regulation. For example, in Brazil, the National Agency of Electrical Energy establishes specific sustainability guidelines for the energy sector (Braga et al., 2014).\\n\\n# 3.2 Models and method\\n\\nThe difficulties in finding adequate measures for firms social and sustainability concerns are probably because of the diversity of actions a firm may undertake in such framework, the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='5da3f216-dc07-496a-8d61-86b3d064a6f3', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Table I Sample distribution by industry\\n\\n|Industry|Full sample n (%)|Leading CSP firms (ISE firms) n (%)|Other firms (non-ISE firms) n (%)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Petroleum and fuel products|50 (1.86)|2 (0.62)|48 (2.03)|\\n|Chemicals, paper products and metal-mechanical|390 (14.53)|55 (16.98)|335 (14.19)|\\n|Equipment, electrical machinery and transport equipment|231 (8.60)|19 (5.86)|212 (8.98)|\\n|Building and transportation|288 (10.73)|23 (7.10)|265 (11.22)|\\n|Food products, beverages and tobacco|255 (9.50)|14 (4.32)|241 (10.21)|\\n|Textile, clothing, leather and footwear|344 (12.81)|13 (4.01)|331 (14.02)|\\n|Communication|74 (2.76)|16 (4.94)|58 (2.46)|\\n|Electrical, water supply and sanitary services|379 (14.12)|114 (35.19)|265 (11.22)|\\n|Financial|268 (9.98)|45 (13.89)|223 (9.45)|\\n|Others|406 (15.12)|23 (7.10)|383 (16.22)|\\n|Total|2,685 (100.00)|324 (100.00)|2,361 (100.00)|\\n\\nabsence of uniform disclosure format and also its non-mandatory nature (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Aguinis and Glavas, 2012). Sustainability concerns are associated with firm’s environmental concerns and also with firm’s capacity to maintain performance and competitive advantage which may be dependent on good management and corporate governance practices, which signals the relevance given to the economic pillar of sustainability (Moldan et al., 2012). All this means that CSP indices are subject to complex measuring strategies as can be seen in the multiplicity of indices used (Li and Tang, 2007; Hodgson et al., 2011).\\n\\nThis work uses the membership to the Brazilian Firm ISE as proxy for the level of firm CSP given that it integrates CSR and sustainability concerns. The annual membership to the ISE is the dependent variable (CSP) in the logit panel data model of equation (1):\\n\\nCSPi;t = b0 + b1 OWNCi;t + b2 RSKINDi;t + b3 ROAi;t + b4 SIZE + b5 GOPPi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (1)\\n\\nIn model of equation (1), the dummy variable CSP, is set to 1 if firm i is present in the ISE at year t, meaning high CSP, and 0 otherwise. OWNC is a measure of ownership concentration in hands of the first up to the fifth main stockholder. It corresponds to the voting capital held by the main stockholder (OWNC1), the sum of voting capital in hands of the two main stockholders (OWNC2) and so forth up to the sum of voting stocks held by the five main stockholders (OWNC5). Additionally, for sensitivity analysis, we also estimate alternate logit panel data models. First, we use the annual Herfindahl index of voting ownership concentration in hands of the five main voting shareholders for each firm-year observation (HI5). The Herfindahl index corresponds to the sum of squares of voting stocks held by each of the five main shareholders following previous literature (Maury and Pajuste, 2005). Second, we use a dummy variable for the presence of a dominant controlling shareholder, i.e. a stockholder that holds more than 50 per cent of voting capital (MAJOR).\\n\\nEnvironmental risky industry (RSKIND) was taken into account based on the Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment (Law 10.165/2000). Such law created a fee for environmental control and inspection that are to be paid by firms from environmental risky industries. Law 10.165/2000 lists which are those environmental risky industries in terms of the potential to damage the natural environment. Thus, RSKIND is a dummy variable that is set to 1 if the firm sector is in the list of environmental risky industries, and is set to 0 otherwise.\\n\\nGrowth opportunities (GOPP) is proxied by Tobin’s q which is calculated as the ratio between firm’s market value plus debt, and firm’s accounting value, as usual in the literature (Villalonga and Amit, 2006).

The fairly low coefficient of variation (CV) also signals that there is little variation in the high levels of concentration.

As can be observed, leading CSP firms (firms at the ISE index) present lower level of voting ownership concentration (OWNC), have more growth opportunities (GOPP), present higher profitability (ROA) and are larger (SIZE). Additionally, the proportion of firms from environmental risky industries in the group of leading CSP firms is 73.15 per cent which is significantly higher than 26.85 per cent from other sectors as detected by the test of difference in proportions (p-value = 0.000) (Table IV).\\n\\n# Table IV\\n\\nNumber of firm year observations at the ISE and from environmental risky industries\\n\\n|Firm from|Non-member|Member|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Non environmental risky industry (Law 10,165)|992|87|1,079|\\n|% line|91.94|8.06|100.00|\\n|% column|42.02|26.85|40.19|\\n|% total|36.95|3.24|40.19|\\n|Environmental risky industry (Law 10,165)|1,369|237|1,606|\\n|% line|85.24|14.76|100.00|\\n|% column|57.98|73.15|59.81|\\n|% total|50.99|8.83|59.81|\\n|Total|2,361|324|2,685|\\n|% line|87.93|12.07|100.00|\\n\\nNotes: environmental risk industries.

Among the firms that are members of the ISE sustainability index, the highest proportion is relative to environmental risky industries (73.15 per cent), while only 26.85 per cent are from other industries. That is a strong indication in the direction of H2 which predicts that firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have greater CSP.\\n\\nResults for model estimates of equation (1) for the whole sample are exhibited in Table V. Alternate models that include debt as explanatory variable were estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms (Table VI).\\n\\nAs hypothesized, voting ownership concentration of the Brazilian firm negatively affects its CSP, proxied by the probability of the firm being in the ISE index (Table V) (H1). This result is consistent to models estimated with different measures of ownership concentration, i.e. the presence of a major controlling shareholder (MAJOR) (Table V, column i), the sum of voting stocks in hands of the first up to the three main shareholders (OWNC1 to OWNC3) (Table V, columns iii, iv and v) and also by the Herfindahl index among the five main stockholders (HI5) (column ii). Taking into account that CSP includes ESG concerns such result is consistent with the argument that large controlling shareholders of the Brazilian firm may not see sustainability concerns as so relevant. Together, corporate governance and the economic pillar of sustainability are very important in the ISE index (approximately 30 per cent of the questionnaire). The high importance of corporate governance concerns embedded in the ISE sustainability index may be relevant for this inverse relation given that prior literature has pointed out ownership concentration is associated to weaker corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Hu and Izumida, 2008; Branda˜ o and Cris ostomo, 2015). Under the agency theoretical framework, this situation may contribute to a rise in agency conflicts among controlling, minority and external stakeholders. It is also noticed that the negative effect of ownership concentration over CSP is absent when considering.\\n\\n# Table V\\n\\n# Panel data logistic models of CSP on firm attributes for the whole sample\\n\\n|Variable|(i)|(ii)|(iii)|(iv)|(v)|(vi)|(vii)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|MAJOR|0.955|–|–|–|–|–|–|\\n|HI5|–|1.975|–|–|–|–|–|\\n|OWNC1|–|–|1.719|–|–|–|–|\\n|OWNC2|–|–|–|2.013|–|–|–|\\n|OWNC3|–|–|–|–|1.949|–|–|\\n|OWNC4|–|–|–|–|–|1.660|–|\\n|OWNC5|–|–|–|–|–|–|1.651|\\n|RSKIND|1.863|1.852|1.844|1.908|1.883|1.834|–|\\n|ROA|3.002|2.964|2.951|2.929|2.943|2.953|2.935|\\n|SIZE|2.283|2.244|2.258|2.276|2.271|2.273|2.274|\\n|GOPP|0.807|0.795|0.805|0.807|0.806|0.813|0.816|\\n|Constant|38.74|37.95|38.00|37.92|37.74|37.89|37.89|\\n|N. obs.|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|\\n|N. firms|327|327|327|327|327|327|327|\\n|Wald chi2(14)|98.79|99.13|98.56|98.58|98.43|97.69|97.35|\\n|p-value|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|\\n\\nNotes: Estimates obtained from panel data logistic model.

DEBT is leverage measured as total debt divided by total assets; and refer to 1, 5 and 10% significance levels, respectively ownership concentration is in hands of the four and five main shareholders (OWNC4 to OWNC5) (Table IV, columns vi and vii). That means that higher voting concentrated ownership among the four and five main large shareholders may signal that the presence of more than three large blockholders is able to reduce the detrimental effect of up to three controlling shareholders on sustainability performance. This finding is in the direction of the contest power of blockholders over the excess power of one or two large controlling shareholders (Jara-Bertin et al., 2008). Besides the contest power, this could also be because of advances in blockholders’ sensitivity to CSR issues in more recent periods because of local and global institutional pressures.\\n\\nAs proposed under the rationale of H2, an important firm attribute – the firm pertinence to an environmental risky industry (RSKIND) – may be an important determinant for the degree of firm CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries seem to be more committed to social and sustainability issues signaling that such firms believe that higher CSP is an important instrument to improve firm reputation and legitimacy of its activities. The activities undertaken by such firms to manage environmental concerns may probably increase their punctuation in ISE’s inquire at the same time that these firms are probably struggling to be a member of the annual ISE list as a way to show that they are actually concerned with sustainability issues. In fact, a detailed analysis of membership to the ISE sustainability index shows that firms seem to make an effort to be at the ISE index as depicted by the presence of firms in consecutive years. Among these persistent firms, many of them are from environmental risky industries, as is the case of AES ELETROPAULO, CEMIG, CPFL ENERGIA and BRASKEM which were present in ten periods at ISE, or GERDAU and SUZANO PAPEL which were at the ISE index in nine periods (Cris ostomo et al., 2018).\\n\\nContrary to our expectation, profitability is not a determinant for the degree of CSP (H3). In fact, the set of results in the literature are not conclusive about this effect.

Other firm attributes have shown to be able to affect CSP. In fact, firm size has a positive effect over CSP as argued under H4, supporting the suggestion that larger firms are more capable of addressing social and sustainability concerns given that they tend to have more resources available for that (Udayasankar, 2008). Firm growth opportunities also have a positive effect over CSP as proposed under the rationale of H5 that the need to seize growth opportunities will require more firm commitment to social and sustainability concerns, as well as with good corporate governance practices, given that this may be relevant in the search for funds to finance firms’ investment projects.\\n\\nThe alternate models estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms with the debt variable (DEBT) included as an explanatory variable are shown in Table VI. As can be derived from models coefficients, the aforementioned results were confirmed. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries (RSKIND) present higher probability of being a leading CSP firm. High ownership concentration indeed has a negative effect on firm’s CSP and the absence of such adverse effect for the concentration in hands of the main four and five shareholders (OWNC4 and OWNC5) signal that more large shareholders are able to minimize such negative effect on firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Table VI, columns vi and vii). The same result holds for larger firms and firms with more growth opportunities.\\n\\nAs hypothesized, growth opportunities have a positive effect on Brazilian firm CSP proxied by the firm pertinence to the ISE index. Indeed, a firm with more growth opportunities needs all available funds to maximize them. For so, the firm must signal that it ratifies good corporate governance practices and has sustainability as a relevant concern. This is crucial in the financial market. This finding of the positive influence of growth opportunities on CSP is in accordance with previous results (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Ziegler and Schro¨der, 2010).\\n\\nThe positive effect of firm size on CSP of Brazilian firm follows the theoretical proposal that larger firms are more able to undertake social responsibility actions (CSR) and, in parallel, are required to show more high standards of sustainability concerns. This finding is also consistent with previous studies in different markets, including Brazil (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Nunes et al., 2010).\\n\\nContrary to the expected negative effect, there is no effect of debt over CSP according to the results. In fact, debt costs and possible undesirable external control from creditors does not seem to adversely affect CSP. That could be because of the fact that more concern on firm sustainability is suggested to be positive to external financing given that the funding market may take such concern into account when analyzing firm funding requests (Magnanelli and Izzo, 2017; Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). This conflicting situation between favorable and unfavorable effect of debt over CSP may lead to the absence of association between debt and an index that incorporates CSR and sustainability.\\n\\nAdditional models were estimated to assess whether the financial crisis (2007-2009) which affected many countries, was able to deter CSP of Brazilian firms given its potential to decrease firms’ financial performance with possible negative effect on CSP. Table VII summarizes results of model estimates that integrate period dummy variables that refer to the periods before, during and after crisis. The findings signal that indeed the crisis period had an adverse effect on CSP (Table VII; Panel A). Mainly, important is that in the period after crisis there has been observed a strong trend for improvement in Brazilian firms’ CSP (Table VII; Panel B).\\n\\nOverall, the findings show that indeed firm membership to an environmental risky industry is an important firm attribute for higher public accountability and better CSP.

Additional evidence is provided about the adverse effect of high ownership concentration of Brazilian firms on CSP, revealing that large controlling shareholders are not so concerned with ESG issues. Perhaps, the great proportion of corporate governance and economic dimensions of the ISE index may be driving this result taking into account that previous literature has found important negative effect of ownership concentration over corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Branda˜ o and Cris ostomo, 2015). Worth noting is the new evidence provided that more large blockholders seem to be able to reduce this negative influence of high ownership concentration over CSP which may signal the existence of an initial contest power in this specific firm policy.

Conclusions\\n\\nThe increasing relevance of CSP, which comprises ESG concerns, on business practices, has motivated research about its drivers. In this context, this work analyzes CSP determinants in an important emerging market, Brazil. CSP is proxied by the firm’s annual membership to the Brazilian ISE. Firm’s presence in the ISE index is conditioned on a tough competition among firms that fulfill a specific questionnaire comprising seven dimensions of corporate, social and sustainability concerns. A new large panel data set of Brazilian firms for the period of 2006-2015 was built, containing 2,685 firm-year observations with at least four years of observations for each firm.\\n\\nLiterature has suggested a set of firm attributes as able to affect firm CSP, as for example, firm size, firm performance, industry environmental sensitivity and ownership structure. This work provides evidence that firms from environmental risky industries are found to be leading CSP firms given that they have higher probability to be present in the Brazilian ISE. This reality shows that indeed firm’s industry environmental sensitivity is relevant to CSP. This may be a consequence of stakeholders’ pressure and institutional advances achieved in Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment which may be leading to positive enforcement results. It is important to highlight the negative effect of macroeconomic conditions during the financial crisis (2007-2009) on Brazilian firm CSP and that in the aftermath when such adverse situation seems to have faced a reversion.\\n\\nUnder the agency theoretical framework, high firm ownership concentration is proposed as able to align the principal and agent interests, at the same time that may favor the interests of controlling shareholders who become powerful enough to influence important firm policies, including social and sustainability responsibilities.

This result signals that controlling shareholders may not see the whole set of social and sustainability issues as a priority. It is important to highlight the new finding that more large stockholders appear to be able to contest the excess power of controlling blockholders and reduce the negative impact of high ownership concentration over CSP, signaling an emerging contest power in this context. Besides, larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities seem to be more committed to undertaking social and sustainability actions.\\n\\nThe contribution of the work is twofold and may be of interest to distinct constituencies. The research analyzes the composition of the ISE index (Brazilian ISE) which indeed integrates ESG concerns. For researchers, the index analysis is important given its relevance nowadays when social concerns in general have gained importance in financial markets. Starting from the ISE index analysis, the work provides additional evidence on the firm’s attributes that influence CSP, as proxied by membership to the ISE index. Similar research may be undertaken in other markets using similar methodology, given that indices such as ISE do not publicize firm punctuation.\\n\\nNew relevant evidence is provided about the fact that firms from environmental risky industries are linked to higher probability of composing the sustainability index and thus to higher standards of social and sustainability activities. This finding builds on stakeholder theory by highlighting positive results from the Brazilian environmental legislation, being an important discovery to both environmentalists and academics. The analysis of how voting ownership concentration affects firm’s CSP builds on both agency and stakeholder theories by exposing agency conflicts and stakeholders’ interests. This examination provides evidence that CSP is negatively affected by high ownership concentration in Brazil, in accordance with prior results but also pointing out the new finding that the presence of other large shareholders, who are associated to more ownership dispersion, seem to be able to contest the power of large controlling blockholders.\\n\\nThe paper concludes highlighting the importance of enforcing corporate social and sustainability institutionalization in Brazil. The positive effects obtained from the advances in environmental legislation must be taken into account to foster strengthening in other dimensions of CSP such as the relations with employees and civil society. Policymakers ought to observe society demands and the need to preserve the natural environment. In this regard, the encouragement of civil society to pressure government and firms for better CSP is very relevant.\\n\\nThe present findings are relevant to the ongoing debate on the importance of CSP and firms’ attributes that influence on it. Thus, this work meets the request from international audience for this kind of research in emerging economies which present distinct institutional environments and incipient capital markets. The results refer to the 9a economy in the world that is a BRIC member.\\n\\nSome research lines are identified. Analyzing the seven ISE axes separately may be considered a limitation of this work while it is a challenge for future research. Studying the effect of other aspects of Brazilian firms’ ownership structure also emerges as another insightful research as is the case of controlling blockholders’ nature. Specific works may also try to capture the capacity of civil society organizations to pressure for CSP advances.\\n\\n# Note\\n\\n1.

Corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) is considered a useful tool to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of stakeholders in the quest for sustainability. However, the degree of cultural and political influences for being sustainably orientated can be significantly different between countries. This study aims to examine the perception of financial analysts, as CSD report users, in China about the level of importance of various indicators of corporate sustainability described in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach – A set of questionnaires was developed based on GRI G4 guidelines to measure the perception of financial analysts in China on the level of importance of each sustainability indicator described in the GRI G4. A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the report users’ perceptions of each of the indicators.\\n\\nFindings – The findings of this study increase our understanding of how Chinese CSD report users perceive corporate sustainability differently from the GRI guidelines. The main results show that the environmental aspect of sustainability was seen to be important in China, followed by the social and economic aspects. Indicator-wise, “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” were perceived as vital in the environmental category, while “customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” were considered significant in the social category.\\n\\nOriginality/value – This study addresses the need for differing corporate sustainability guidelines for different nations and cultures, specifically within the Chinese context. It also contributes to the corporate sustainability literature by adding to our understanding of how financial analysts in China, as CSD report users, perceive aspects of sustainability.\\n\\nKeywords China, Financial analysts, Sustainability, GRI, Corporate sustainability disclosure, Users’ perception\\n\\nPaper type Research paper\\n\\n# Jhunru Zhang and Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta\\n\\nare both based at the School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia.\\n\\n# Terri Trireksani\\n\\nis based at the School of Business, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nWhile the economic development of China over the preceding decades has led to significant improvement in its national prosperity, it has also generated a considerable degree of concern about corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability disclosures (CSD) are generally considered to be the most effective and efficient way for companies to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of company stakeholders’ quest for sustainability and to inform the society about their sustainability performance (Qian et al., 2015). Because of the lack of comprehensive and effectively enforced CSD regulations, the growth of corporate sustainability practices in China extensively depends on voluntary disclosure practice (Zhang et al., 2015). However, as\\n\\nReceived 21 October 2018\\n\\nRevised 8 July 2019\\n\\nAccepted 14 July 2019\\n\\nDOI 10.1108/SRJ-10-2018-0272\\n\\n© Emerald Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='0cd04e95-a4e8-4840-aad4-51f2fbd388d7', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Recognised the importance of issuing corporate sustainability reports because of the severe environmental deterioration and significant social issues raised in tandem with the boost of the Chinese economy.\\n\\nFor example, the serious milk powder corporate scandals in mainland China have raised extreme concern regarding companies’ social responsibility: in 2008, Sanlu Group added melamine into the formula of milk powder to boost the protein content. Infants who consumed this product were highly likely to develop kidney stones or even an illness that was fatal if seriously affected. Sanlu Group was one of the largest milk powder manufacturers and sellers in China for over 15 continuous years, and it was once the biggest taxpayer. The revelation of the scandal caused the failure and bankruptcy of Sanlu, and, more importantly, it destroyed people’s confidence in the Chinese milk powder supply industry. The 300,000 victims triggered considerable social pressure, which consequently affected thousands of workers, causing them to lose their jobs (Nornha et al., 2013). Society, as a result, had to bear this significant social cost.\\n\\nAs such, the unique context in China provides a significant setting to examine CSD perception from its users’ end. The local Chinese community, in general, has relatively high societal acceptance towards CSD information. Under the Confucius perspective, maximising shareholders’ value and financial profit should not be the only goal of making corporations sustainable (Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009). Xia et al. (2009) emphasised the idea of righteousness before profits and stated that the fundamental value of ethics should reflect the business values. Hence, concerns and actions should always be closely related to all of the customers’, employees’ and shareholders’ values, and sustainability information is in favour for the general community as Confucian culture has been embedded in the basis of modern corporate sustainability in Chinese companies (Zhu and Yao, 2008).\\n\\nIn addition, Chinese enterprises are increasingly pressured by numerous stakeholders and by the general public to engage in social and environmental sustainability. In particular, in China, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) have made a great effort to promote corporate governance initiatives in past years. Ho (2013) indicates that the rapid growth of these markets is significantly influenced by two essential pieces of legislation: the Company Law and the Securities Law, enacted in 1993 and 1998, respectively. The Company Law provides the legal requirement for the transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private or listed enterprises. To conform to the two legislations, the stock exchanges in China have implemented guidelines for their listed corporations to take responsibility for their stakeholders. The SZSE issued the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Guidelines for Listed Companies in 2006 and the SSE issued similar guidelines in 2008, and both stock exchanges begin to mandate CSR reporting in a subset of listed companies. However, the guidelines provide limited assistance to companies preparing for their disclosures. The lack of a prescribed reporting framework is, therefore, ambiguous and has led to large variations in reporting practice, such that users find the reports challenging to compare and use for decision-making (Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, sustainability information can be used for window-addressing and causes heterogeneous expectation among investors. The subsequent noise increases stock price volatility and decreases firm values (Orlitzky, 2013). Given the local community in China is in favour for CSD information, particularly under the sustainability promotional strategy by the state government, CSD reporting companies are likely to be inadequately guided by the existent guidelines and generating information that increases the dispersion of the market expectation. However, limited research has examined what is expected from primary stakeholders and how the reporting companies should address such expectations. As such, in this study, we focus on financial analysts’ perceived importance of CSD in the unique institutional setting of China.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='12881a1a-ad49-4c27-b02d-c5ff2cd8bb93', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 2. Literature review and hypotheses development\\n\\n# 2.1 The context of sustainability reporting in China\\n\\nSustainability reporting, which is also referred to as CSR reporting, focused solely on social issues at its very beginning stage in the early 1960s (Lin, 2010). Elkington (1994) suggested that there are six stages of CSD development, which include ignorance, awakening, denial, guilt reduction, displacement behaviour and tokenism, conversion and finally, integration. This was further extended and re-summarised by Dunphy et al. (2003). They developed more sophisticated concepts for each of the six stages of CSD development, which include rejection, non-responsiveness, compliance, efficiency, strategic proactivity and the sustaining corporation.\\n\\nAfter the emergence of triple bottom line reporting, the number of companies that issued CSD increased, with different names to show different areas of focus. Reynolds and Yuthas (2008) explained this early stage of reporting sustainability as companies owing the duty to the society in which they are bonded with a social contract.\\n\\nAccording to Freeman (1984), sustainability reporting is an approach for a company to identify its socially relevant behaviour, determine those to whom the company is accountable for its environmental and social performance and develop appropriate measures and reporting techniques. However, being sustainable or ecologically responsible is defined differently across cultures (Hofstede, 1980).\\n\\nIn China, CSD is mostly perceived to be a response to external government and public pressures on corporate management (Gao, 2009). The notion of corporate sustainability reporting was first proposed in 2006 in the amendment of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China, Article 5 of the General Law. Later in 2006, in the Chinese Communist Party Sixth Plenary Session, a national plan proposal was made to create a harmonious Chinese society with a focus on being socially responsible, particularly for business enterprises (Gao, 2010).\\n\\nAs a response to the national plan, the SSE and SZSE issued social reporting guidelines in 2006 and 2008, respectively, to create an appropriate system for corporate sustainability reporting. According to the SSE guidelines Notice for Better Reporting 2008 Annual Reports, a subset of industries that were listed in the Chinese financial market, including the SSE corporate governance sector, firms with shares listed overseas and financial companies, were mandated to prepare CSR reports alongside the annual reports. However, despite the introductions of a number of policies after the two stock exchange markets announced their guidelines, the meaning and definition of corporate sustainability were never specified. The guidelines also did not provide any indication of how to prepare and what to include in a CSD. While the CSR guidelines in China have initiated systematics rule and approaches to report CSR, the coverage and the specificity of the reports are still less comprehensive than those formulated in the Western context (Nornha et al., 2013).\\n\\nThe board indications from the CSR guidelines in China are provided below:\\n\\n- Listed companies are encouraged to disclose non-financial information in CSR reports.\\n- Non-financial information should be based on the triple bottom line namely, economic, social and environmental information.\\n- CSR reports should be endorsed by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.\\n- Areas and circumstances in which listed companies should compulsorily disclose environmental information are indicated.\\n- A new concept of social contribution value per share (SCVPS), a ratio used to measure the listed companies.\\n\\n(Nornha et al., 2013, p. 32)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='f4da1f6e-f0c8-4774-a22d-6f2e7cac93f8', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='As suggested further by Nornha et al. (2013), the reporting companies could choose their own methods to calculate the related ratio under the guidelines, which was subjective and challenging for companies to follow. While the concept of corporate sustainability has become more commonly accepted in China, there has been no agreed-upon definition of it. Therefore, the standardisation and the regulations of corporate sustainability in China are in a great need of development (Bai et al., 2015).\\n\\n# 2.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines in China\\n\\nIn China, the GRI (2013) guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reportings. In recent decades, GRI has attempted to provide comprehensive guidelines for CSD by setting indicators in corporate economic, environmental and social sustainability (Chauvey et al., 2015). Firms that adopt GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines need to report their strategy in the company profiles, explain their management approach as to how they address corporate sustainability practices and disclose their company sustainability (economic, environmental and social) performance (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). GRI, overall, provides companies with information on how and what to report in CSD.\\n\\nWhile GRI provides such comprehensive sets of guidelines on CSR, it ultimately aims to enhance companies’ information transparency and overall accountability. This has elevated the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to become the most commonly used framework internationally (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). The KPMG Questionnaire into CSR (KPMG, 2008) examined the top 250 companies listed on the Fortune Global 500 and the 100 largest firms by revenue in 22 countries. The results showed that more than 75 per cent of companies from the Fortune Global 500 and 70 per cent of the 100 largest revenue firms applied the GRI. GRI is also considered practical for firms to use as report preparers are able to self-examine their own level of corporate sustainability performance.\\n\\nAs suggested by Brown et al. (2009), GRI is significant in terms of its “broad range of stakeholders” approach, as well as institutionalising multi-stakeholders on reporting and accountability. However, Drori et al. (2006) indicated that GRI is mostly presented by multinational companies on a global basis and international accounting firms have large influence on standardising the guidelines. Western multinational firms, therefore, help to set the agenda on corporate sustainability reporting based on their own interests (Vigneau et al., 2015). It is suggested that “the guidelines’ lack of universal applicability creates a perceived unfairness inherent in imposing Western standards of social behaviour and associated reporting practices” (Adams and McNicholas, 2007, p. 484).\\n\\nNevertheless, GRI remains highly authoritative globally because of its context, language, concepts and assumptions (Brown et al., 2009). It has a significant role to highlight the importance of corporate sustainability reporting and has led to new practices of corporate sustainability and responsibility (Vigneau et al., 2015). Hopkins (2004) also contends that the GRI guidelines include some aspects of the other popular environmental and social guidelines, such as the ISO 14000 and the global Sullivan principles.\\n\\n# 2.3 Perceptions and motivations of sustainability in China\\n\\nEarly studies on the topic of perception of CSR in the Chinese context have broadly discussed the differential impact to measure CSR based on the Western and the Chinese definitions. Both Western and Chinese literature indicates that corporate sustainability is, to some degree, directly related to shareholders and companies values, as well as the need for the companies to be legitimate and ethical. Cultural differences have also created some different perceptions about corporate sustainability in the West and the East. Many studies, which were conducted in China, into Chinese culture and corporate sustainability, have explored the idea of profits from righteousness (Yi) principle, derived from Confucius.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='af9b9a05-564f-4d1d-959b-3a9661f988b2', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Another stream of studies on CSR perception in China is generally focused on the potential of political interference and government intervention, and it examines the disclosure content to reveal the propensity for firms to report on government policies (Gao, 2011; Kuo et al., 2012; Li and Zhang, 2010; Marquis and Qian, 2014). Kuo et al. (2012), based on a content analysis of Chinese data obtained from CSR reports, found that environmental sensitivity and ownership structures distinguish corporate environmental disclosures. Sensitive industries and government-owned firms are found to be more committed to providing environmental disclosures than less-sensitive industries and non-government-owned firms. They were also highly engaged in energy saving, carbon reduction, research and application of new techniques – beneficial activities that assist China in dealing with the global warming issue. Kuo et al.’s (2012) study also suggested that the Chinese government has an important role in promoting corporate CSR engagement.\\n\\nMarquis and Qian (2014) examined corporate strategic response to government signals through CSR disclosure. They examined 1,600 listed firms between 2006 and 2009, and their results supported the findings of Kuo et al. (2012) that the Chinese government’s signalling is a critical driver for corporate reporting, particularly for the SOEs that exert substantial political influence. Further, they found that the reporting companies are highly subjective to decoupling risk under specific monitoring mechanism. The expectation of policymakers drove the reported CSR practices.\\n\\nGao (2011) found that the listed companies in the Chinese financial market had, overall, a positive attitude to engage in CSR. Specifically, they found that SOEs have a higher tendency to engage in social issues through CSR than the non-SOEs. Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.\\n\\nThrough a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”. They discussed the multiplexity of the business system and its impact on the CSR concepts in the Chinese context. In particular, they examined the “authorisation capitalism” within the family owned small and medium firms, which suggested that the CSR engagement in these types of firms was oriented to local concern and driven by the local community’s perception of the CSR.\\n\\n# 2.3.1 Users’ perceived importance of corporate sustainability disclosure in China\\n\\nWhile existing literature in Chinese CSR has focused more on SOEs, there are also some limited studies that explore CSR practices at non-SOEs. Kuo et al. (2015), for example, suggested that there were no significant differences between environmental disclosure at SOEs and those at the privately owned enterprises. Based on an evaluation of 781 CSR reports between 2008 and 2010, they found the higher disclosure quality in CO2 and SO2 emission was predominantly because of the government-led national strategy; however, other social activities were better reported by privately owned firms.\\n\\nFrom the theoretical point of view, signalling theory has been getting attention in corporate disclosure studies in recent years, because it assumes that people send and explain signals to reduce information asymmetry (Lin, 2010). The theory considers that information asymmetry typically exists in a capital market. Under this assumption, information obtained from the management level is considered as much more accurate and reliable than information obtained from the market (Shan and Taylor, 2014). Therefore, investors seek information transparency through corporate sustainability information; without it, they cannot respond quickly to make rational decisions about the most effective investment (Shan and Taylor, 2014). It is also assumed that CSD could lower companies’ capital costs (Li et al., 2013) as well as increase sales (Creyer, 1997), market share and brand value (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2005), because firms with a higher degree of sustainability engagement have.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='a0807455-9b8d-44a0-8d0e-6b0043c44745', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='higher propensity to outperform the non-sustainability performing firms (Dhaliwal et al., 2011).\\n\\nCompanies that disclose non-financial information signal their willingness to communicate with their stakeholders about sustainability issues that are unknown by the market (Yang, 2011), and companies produce stand-alone reports when the benefit of providing such disclosure outweighs the related costs. Companies with sound performance will deliver their positive image to the public and be distinguished examples among their peers.\\n\\nThe users of CSD, in general, include a broad range of company stakeholders, such as socially conscious customers, employees, non-governmental organisations, regulators, investors and financial analysts (Cordeiro and Tewari, 2015). In the context of China, signalling theory is relevant for evaluating the users’ perception of CSD in China because most of the ordinary companies in China have no experience and are not willing to disclose voluntary sustainability information (Shan and Taylor, 2014). However, they have increasingly received significant pressure from the public, the government and industrial associations, to disclose.\\n\\nFor companies that have produced sustainability reports, and those that plan to do so, it is still not clear which sustainability indicators are considered important to disclose by the report users in China. Only if users perceive a strong and significant relationship between relevant indicators in sustainability reports and long-term corporate performance, they will find the data in the reports as useful. Therefore, understanding users’ perceived importance of CSD is essential.\\n\\nThis provides motivations to us to assess the level of importance of the CSD in China from the users’ perspective. Considering that GRI guidelines are mostly used in China for sustainability reporting, in this study, we use sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to evaluate users’ perceived importance of each of the indicators. Respondents in this study are asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. The data are accordingly analysed to reflect the users’ perceived level of importance of the corporate environmental, economic and social information disclosures.\\n\\n# Hypotheses\\n\\nAccordingly, this study proposes the following set of hypotheses:\\n\\n- H1. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate sustainability information disclosure as high.\\n- H1A. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate environmental information disclosure as high.\\n- H1B. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate economic information disclosure as high.\\n- H1C. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate social information disclosure as high.\\n\\n# 2.3.2 Chinese report users’ perspective on Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability indicators\\n\\nWhile GRI guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reporting, there have been some concerns regarding the potentially different perceptions of the level of importance of the indicators listed on the GRI guidelines. Wang and Juslin (2009), for example, based on their literature study on terms of differences between the West and East contexts, claim that Western corporate sustainability concepts do not adapt well to the Chinese market, because they have rarely defined the primary reason for corporate sustainability. The ethic approach to the corporate sustainability concept does not take the Chinese reality and culture into consideration. They point out that corporate sustainability is a term that may be legitimately interpreted within the Chinese corporate culture. However, Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasise the “cultivation of virtue and morality, as well', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='0db14390-3736-4d81-8bf8-2127ce7b5590', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='as the core of its harmony notion” (Wang and Juslin, 2009, p. 446), offer a better understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context. Accordingly, there may be some of the indicators listed on GRI guidelines that are not relevant within the Chinese context, and hence, they are not considered as necessary by the Chinese report users. This study tries to evaluate whether it is indeed some differences in the way Chinese report users’ perceived level of importance of sustainability information indicators listed in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines than what are intended by the GRI by including the indicators in the GRI guidelines.\\n\\nIn this study, we use a Likert scale of 4 being “important” as the basis GRI score for each of the GRI indicators and compare it with the respondents’ mean values for each of the relevant indicators. A t-test is used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores, which indicates whether Chinese report users perceive the level of importance of sustainability information in GRI guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.\\n\\n# 3. Methodology\\n\\n# 3.1 Questionnaire design\\n\\nBillings and Halstead (2005) suggested that one of the best ways to obtain information about beliefs, behaviours, views and perceptions of individuals in the business world is to ask questions with closed ends. In this study, a Web-based questionnaire was designed based on sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The scale of GRI has been validated by Chow and Chen (2012), in which corporate sustainability construct was modelled in social, environmental and economic dimensions.\\n\\nTo verify the measurement scale, they adopted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modelling and confirmed the validity of the proposed GRI model. While Chow and Chen (2012) address the partial concerns of the validity of GRI from the preparer’s end, their results are limited to interpret the perception from the report users. According to Brown and Deegan (1998), materiality within the sustainability report is used to be the way of potential organisational financial risks by address concerns from various stakeholders. It is imperative to consider corporate sustainability also from the report users’ perception.\\n\\nIn our data collection, each respondent was asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. A five-point Likert scale was used because the scale is considered suitable to provide sufficient discrimination for most purposes and can be easily understood by respondents (Brace, 2004).\\n\\njSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='40589d85-f19f-4b80-a618-b3342805b907', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='As the questionnaire was designed based on the structure of GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, there were 11 questions about environmental disclosure, 4 questions about economic disclosure and 28 questions about social disclosure. The questions were translated into Chinese with the assistance of professional translators. To ensure the accuracy of the translation, we wrote emails to the first 30 respondents who left their contact details at the end in our pilot study. We asked about their understanding of our questionnaires with the Chinese version of GRI attached. Overall the respondents found the questionnaires are well written, and we decided to continue the full sample data collection. Discrepancies, reliability and validity were studied and tested in a pilot test, which involved 30 financial analysts from China. Appropriate adjustments were made to suit the terms used in China and the local dialect and expressions in the language.\\n\\n# 3.2 Sample data\\n\\nIn this study, financial analysts were used as the target respondents as corporate sustainability information has always been one of the valuable inputs for financial analysts to evaluate and to predict firm value (Lin, 2010). Lin (2010) suggested that financial analysts are experts who assess corporate policies and performance on various issues of sustainability in China and that financial analysts are considered to be the prime CSD users who influence other investors extensively. A good corporate sustainability reputation captured by financial analysts could improve companies’ brand value and reputation, which in turn could enhance the appeal of firm’s products to consumers (Brown and Dacin, 1997) and lead to increased sales (Dhaliwal, et al., 2012).\\n\\nOur sample responses were obtained in 2015, a time when President Xi initiated his leadership in China by imposing a higher degree of national sustainable development through the National Congress and the National Plan (Zhang et al., 2018). Our target respondents were the financial analysts who worked at securities organisations that were registered on the China Securities Regulatory Commission (www.csrc.gov.cn). To approach the financial analysts as our study’s respondents, we sent an email to 200 financial managers who worked at these registered security companies. Their contact information was obtained online. Each manager was also asked to distribute our Web-based survey URL to their financial analysts. We received 129 usable responses. Table I shows the demographic information of the respondents of the survey.\\n\\n# 3.3 Data analysis\\n\\nIn this study, we build on and extend the work of Chow and Chen (2012). Chow and Chen (2012) have indicated the validity of the scale by GRI from the report preparers’ end. We did a validity test by applying the EFA to explore the perceived importance of corporate sustainability reporting from the report users’ perceptive. EFA is commonly used for interpreting self-reporting questionnaires which have been widely used in existing perception and motivation-based CSR research (Dincer and Dincer, 2012; Firmialy and Nainggolan, 2018; Hayton et al., 2004; Latif et al., 2018; Sheng and Chen, 2010). We performed EFA because it reduces a large number of reflective and latent measures into a smaller set (Hair et al., 1995); hence, it confirms the dimensions defined by the GRI and fosters our hypotheses testing in the later part of the study. EFA also provides the significance of validity for the construct under the GRI based on our questionnaires (Hayton et al., 2004).\\n\\nTo test our hypotheses, we adopted t-tests to confirm the level of importance based on our questionnaire results. t-tests are commonly used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores. A one-sample t-test is often considered when only a single sample of the participants and the questions are used to determine whether the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='270658ac-a8fa-4ab7-9c68-803eb87c889d', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Table I Respondents’ profiles (N = 129)\\n\\n|Demographic variables|Frequency|(%)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Gender| | |\\n|Male|61|47.3|\\n|Female|68|52.7|\\n|Location| | |\\n|Beijing|55|42.6|\\n|Shenzhen|31|24|\\n|Jilin|43|33.3|\\n|Education| | |\\n|Below undergraduate level|4|3.1|\\n|Undergraduate degree|67|51.9|\\n|Postgraduate degree|55|42.6|\\n|PhD|3|2.3|\\n|Years of experience| | |\\n|Less than 2 years|45|34.9|\\n|3-4 years|14|10.9|\\n|5-6 years|40|31|\\n|7-8 years|16|12.4|\\n|9 years and more|14|10.9|\\n\\nThe mean of the population from which the sample is drawn is the same as the hypothesised mean (Hair et al., 1995). In this study, one-sample t-test was adopted because the mean value drawn from the users’ perceived importance of each type of sustainability disclosure was compared with the level of importance intended by GRI (i.e. the value of 4 as per the Likert scale used).\\n\\n# 4. Results and analysis\\n\\n# 4.1 Exploratory factor analysis\\n\\nBased on the definition of the sustainability items from GRI, we prepared reflective indicators in the questionnaires in terms of environmental indicators, economic indicators, social indicators – labour and decent work, social indicators – human rights, social indicators – society and social indicators – product responsibility. The estimation of the EFA results is presented in Table II. Unsurprisingly, EFA reveals six underlying dimensions, which are consistent with the sustainability definition by GRI. We follow the similar approach of Latif et al. (2018) in the critical assumption of EFA. Firstly, our correlation matrix shows that all items were significant at p < 0.001 level. Interestingly, we detect that “environment grievance” in the environmental indicator construct has a relatively low factor loading of 0.134. One explanation is that there were limited ways of environmental grievance in the Chinese context because of the lack of government monitoring controls over corporate environmental performance (Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, our result also suggests the suitability of factors with Bartlett’s test of sphericity (x² = 3698.805, df = 946 and p < 0.01) that measures the probability of the correlation matrix with other components, where the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure is 0.849 at 0.01 significance level. Lastly, we accounted for 51.885 per cent of the variation in our data based on the six factors yielded from the scales based on EFA. We further performed a reliability test, in which our Cronbach’s alphas are substantially above the critical value of 0.7. Based on the results from EFA, our results overall show sufficient convergent validity in each construct, which allows us to perform the following t-tests for hypothesis testing.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='10476f13-84c6-4ca5-97af-e571fc5238d7', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='|Items|Indicators|Indicators|Indicators| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Environmental indicators|Economic indicators|Social indicators (labour and decent work)| |\\n|1.

Discussion\\n\\nIn general, our findings of the users’ perceived importance of CSD indicate that the importance of CSD perceived by the report users in China was partially different from what was intended by GRI. The degrees of difference varied across disclosure categories. Our findings show evidence that there are moderate differences in the Chinese report users’.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='af7e9601-9a43-4c33-aac3-4000a9d6f034', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='perceived importance of environmental, economic and social disclosures from what were intended by the GRI. Environmental disclosure, with an overall mean value of 4.20 (out of 5), was perceived as more important by the users than what was intended by the GRI. Social disclosure, with an overall mean value of 3.96 (out of 5) can be considered as having the same level of importance by the users as what was intended by the GRI and, lastly, economic disclosure with a mean value of 3.79 (out of 5), was perceived as less important by the users than what was intended by the GRI.\\n\\nAs shown in Table IX, our results overall show consistency with the existing literature in the context, whereas partial differences are apparent comparing with Western individualistic contexts. Looking closer, environmental indicators that received a high level of perceived importance often relate to the most publicly concerning issues, such as energy, water, emission, effluents and waste in environmental disclosure in China. The results are consistent with literature both in China and Western countries. Lu and Abeysekera (2017) and Chow and Chen (2012) both used Chinese data and found that effluents and waste, emission, compliance and energy are significant from report preparers’ end. In our case, as the data were collected in 2014, a series of promotion on the corporate sustainability development was fostered by President Xi because of the change in leadership. While there is no mandatory requirement on corporate sustainability reporting, environmental control such as carbon emission reduction and energy saving have been incorporated in the National Plan and have been continuously promoted in the national Congress Zhang et al. (2018). This can also be influenced by the 12th Five Year Sustainability Plan by the Chinese government, in which companies were encouraged to disclose use of material, energy consumption and general environmental performance. Although adherence to the plan is on a voluntary basis, seemingly users wanted to see information regarding these areas being disclosed in annual and sustainability reports.\\n\\nWith regard to social disclosure, it is notable that “product responsibility” indicators generally received a high level of perceived importance. Product responsibility is another area of concern in China, because of prior severe food product faults and the milk powder scandal in the community. In comparison with existing research (Chow and Chen, 2012; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017), product safety on customer health was broadly found as an essential factor perceived by report preparers. It is evident that the concerns and the fear of product safety in China are far from resolved. While other social items (e.g. occupational health and safety, employment, security practice, indigenous rights, investment and compliance) also show high consistency with prior literature, the majority of the social related sustainability information was not perceived importantly because of their exclusion from regulations and the voluntary nature in the Western context (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Chow and Chen, 2012; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017).\\n\\nEconomic disclosure was perceived as less important in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. Information included in economic disclosure presents a measurement of the economic outcomes of a company and the effect and relevance of these outcomes on a broad range of stakeholders. As most of the economic disclosure can be obtained from the annual reports, it may be considered less relevant within the context of sustainability reporting, in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. However, economic disclosures were perceived to be much more important in the Western settings (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008; Rueda-Manzanares et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2007). This is consistent without discussion in Section 2.1 that the Western context considers sustainability as a way to stretch the wealth creation, thereby producing the long-term sustainable economic performance (Zhang et al., 2018). In our results, we detected negative associations, which indicate that economic information is considered less attractive because the disclosures may have been released in financial reports.\\n\\njSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='22e751fb-60c1-437f-ab9a-222f5c471fea', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='|CSR items|Amaral and La Rovere (2003)|Baumgartner and Ebner (2010)|Erol et al.

We found that the Chinese concerns on corporate sustainability are partially different from the Western context-based literature, as well as that from the GRI. The national pursuit of sustainability development engaged by the government has an inevitable influence to change and lead corporate stakeholders’ perception of corporate sustainability. The government as a dominance among social actors has a substantial impact on societal acceptance towards corporates, which has gradually embedded in the Chinese culture. We urge future research to consider the political, cultural and policy impact on society’s expectation when analysing the scope and the extent of corporate sustainability reporting in the Chinese context, especially when comparing results again the Western-based studies.\\n\\nOur study is subjected to the following limitations. Firstly, this study has limited the collection of its data from financial analysts in China who are considered as prime CSD users. It is suggested that future research may include other relevant report users to further enhance the findings. Secondly, respondents’ perceptions may change over time, and hence a follow-up survey may be necessary to measure the response in a long-run. Thirdly, the differences in the perceived importance of CSD in different countries is possible to be linked with the levels of their development. Because of the political system in China, corporate stakeholders’ perceptions may be considerably influenced by state government. Hence, it could be important for future research to address this concern by including multi-national perceptions for comparisons.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAdams, C. and McNicholas, P.

Introduction\\n\\nOver the past few decades, there has been a growing emphasis on technological innovation within organizations leading to increased attention in research [1,2]. Organizations have recognized the potential of technological innovations to enhance their competitive advantage. Numerous studies have demonstrated that firms can leverage technology to improve their performance and drive innovation [3,4]. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of AI in today’s market has been shown to have a significant impact on firms’ innovation strategies, as evidenced by several studies [5]. Economists and industry experts have been attempting to comprehend the effect of GAI on innovation and have urged for further investigation on the subject [6,7]. Scholars, who are focused on utilizing technology in creation, have also started to investigate this issue [8–10]. Studies on the use of GAI by customers in various sectors have primarily focused on identifying the barriers that prevent them from achieving the maximum outcome and how AI can assist them in making decisions and enhancing their operations [11,12].\\n\\nConceived as a sub-discipline within AI, GAI allows users to create new content, such as text, images, audio, and videos. It has attracted the interest of various tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Apple. OpenAI’s Codex, DALL-E, and ChatGPT are some of the tools used for this process [13]. Every year, a single overarching idea tends to define the major tech trend. For instance, in 2022, XAI and Web3 emerged as buzzwords.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='25614dd3-7879-4191-bd2f-079ea5c581a0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Technologies 2023, 11, 44\\n\\nthat caught the tech world’s attention. Although these trends show no signs of slowing down, 2023 is expected to be dominated by GAI. The concept of GAI involves using algorithms to generate new content. ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing articles, poems, and computer programs, is a prominent example of this technology. Its ability to generate high-quality content is both impressive and a little scary [14]. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI—a research organization backed by Microsoft—has garnered significant attention since its unveiling in November 2022. Its debut has led some to believe that AI is becoming more mainstream. With the commercial success of ChatGPT, Google recently launched an experimental service called Bard, which demonstrates how AI could potentially revolutionize search by providing more nuanced responses to users. [15]. The same week, Microsoft also unveiled a new Bing-powered version by ChatGPT, designed to provide users with more accurate and timely search results. Instead of relying on the traditional ladder approach to search results, ChatGPT takes a request, scans for answers, and provides a response that includes citations to the sources.\\n\\nDespite the increasing importance of the role of GAI in innovation studies, there has been little effort to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing its applications in various sectors. Moreover, the lack of a clear framework for assessing the impact of GAI on the innovation management process has hindered the development of effective strategies [16, 17]. To tackle these issues, a comprehensive theoretical review of the literature on GAI was conducted. The aim of the review is to provide a basis for developing new theoretical models to study GAI in different sectors [18]. Understanding the diverse needs of customers is essential for creating value that resonates with them. This is because their subjective evaluation of wants and needs can significantly influence the design and implementation of strategies to meet those needs. In addition to identifying customers’ requirements, research emphasizes the importance of customer involvement in co-creating value [19]. Value co-creation refers to the process of involving various stakeholder groups in the creation of a product or service [20]. To enable this process, organizations must leverage appropriate technologies. This can lead to a better customer experience. Information and communications technology (ICT) has become integral to all aspects of life, allowing businesses to enhance their customer experience. By using GAI, companies can further improve their customer experience and provide personalized services [21]. Due to the increasing number of people using social media platforms, the demand for interactive technology has become more prevalent in every industry. It has led to the emergence of GAI as a leading technology flag bearer.\\n\\nThis paper takes a multi-disciplinary approach to explore the potential impact of GAI on customers’ experience across various sectors. It reviews the volume and trends of operative outputs related to GAI applications and identifies factors that influence the adoption of GAI by firms. The paper also proposes a conceptual business model for implementing GAI to achieve goals. However, the study is limited by a lack of comprehensiveness and a narrow scope, making it challenging for scholars to identify relevant gaps in understanding the topic.\\n\\nTo broaden the field’s scope, the research agenda aims to develop new research tools and methods that can enhance the understanding of the various factors influencing the decision-making process and the adoption of GAI. The paper’s main findings suggest that the framework for GAI applications should be interpretive, interactive, and immersive (3I), providing a deeper understanding of the technology’s drivers and outcomes.

Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the findings.\\n\\n# 2. Exploration of GAI\\n\\nGAI is used to create new content such as videos, audio, and text. Recent breakthroughs in this field have the potential to significantly change how we create content. One example of a chatbot that uses GAI is ChatGPT, which can answer questions on the spot. The OpenAI chatbot (ChatGPT), released to the public in November 2022, is regarded as the best. It already had over a million users in just five days [22]. Its creators also posted impressive examples of its output, such as poems and computer code. While the impact of GAI on content creation is still uncertain, some experts in fields such as advertising and education are keeping a close eye on developments in this area.\\n\\nWhile there are concerns about the impact of GAI and machine learning on various industries, there is also significant potential for these technologies to have a positive impact. In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated potential in a variety of fields, including medical imaging. Aside from the technology, multiple questions must be answered to develop GAI models [23]. For instance, how does it fit into the broader machine learning framework?\\n\\nAlthough ChatGPT has received a lot of attention recently, it is not the first text-based AI model to generate interest. Google’s BERT and OpenAI’s GPT-3 have been released to some fanfare in the past couple of years. Despite their impressive capabilities, AI chatbots were not always well reviewed [24]. Google’s chatbots have been criticized in some cases for their limited abilities and inability to provide satisfactory responses to user queries. However, recent advancements in GAI have shown promise, and chatbots such as ChatGPT demonstrate the potential for these technologies to continue to evolve and improve. It will be important to continue to explore new ways to apply AI chatbots in a way that maximizes their benefits and minimizes their limitations.\\n\\nIn the past, human-trained models could classify text according to labels suggested by researchers. This type of training is referred to as supervised learning and involves a human overseeing and instructing the model. Text-based models, on the other hand, are currently being trained using a self-supervised learning approach. This method feeds a model a large amount of text, which helps it generate predictions. For instance, models can predict how a sentence will conclude. These models can become very accurate with the correct sample text, such as a broad swath of online text.\\n\\nIn 2023, GAI was showcased in an epochal manner. AI disrupted the world in 2022 as multiple startups such as DALL-E, MidJourney, and StableDiffusion appeared. Then, in just five days, ChatGPT became one of the most used platforms on the internet, with over a million users. In response to ChatGPT, Google on 7 February 2023 introduced Bard [25]. Google’s newly launched web app, Bard, is expected to be integrated with the company’s other products, including Google Maps and Gmail. The emergence of large language models such as Bard and ChatGPT highlights the evolution of AI from being innocuous to invasive. However, they also pave the way for more productive and creative applications of AI. GAI, for instance, has already begun to shape our entertainment preferences. Streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix use this technology to suggest content based on our past viewing habits [26]. Although users may not be aware of it, GAI is gradually becoming a significant part of our digital experience. The Matrix movie predicted that humans would eventually live in a bubble wherein they feel normal, but machines are feeding their minds. In the future, we will live in a world wherein our existence is cyborg, and we will stop being obsessed with the Bard.\\n\\nThe field of AI has been a hot topic for decades. In recent years, the concept of GAI has gained widespread attention. This technology allows systems to create new content without specific training, such as music, images, and text. Large language models known as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are used in this type of project. “Generative” refers to a system that can create a new text based on the input it receives, while “pre-', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='9e43a9b5-4272-436f-bab0-6c21244ed498', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Technologies 2023, 11, 44\\n\\n“trained” is a system trained on a large amount of text data. “Transformers” can produce output text using a transformer-based framework. Despite the layoffs of tech workers, the interest in GAI remains high. In 2022, about USD 49 billion was invested in AI, 40% higher than the previous year. Despite the tech downturn, AI companies are still attracting much attention from investors. Developing a GAI model is a complex task that only a handful of prominent tech companies have attempted [27]. OpenAI is a leading company that has developed several cutting-edge AI models, including DALL-E, ChatGPT, and GPT. Google’s parent company also owns DeepMind, which is known for its deep learning software. Meanwhile, Meta has entered the field of GAI with its recent product release.\\n\\n# 3.

While conventional design involves a manual, handcrafted approach, generative design uses AI algorithms to generate multiple solutions. This method is more efficient and quicker to implement than manual processes [28]. In addition to creating multiple solutions, the generative design also considers the various criteria set by the software, such as cost and performance. Generative design can create complex components and parts across multiple manufacturing industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and medical equipment. It can help optimize the design of these products for their specific use cases. Aside from being able to design multiple solutions, the technology can also be utilized to create custom parts and products. Various technologies are involved in AI computer-aided design software and machine learning algorithms.\\n\\n# b\\n\\nAI is being brought to a new level by the emergence of generative models. Foundation models are transforming the way applications are developed, reducing the time it takes to develop applications and providing more robust capabilities to non-technical users. Developers of products such as ChatGPT and Copilot are bringing AI into realms previously reserved for humans [29]. With the help of GAI, computers can now produce original content, sketches, and software code. They can also theorize about why a particular production error occurred. Developers can now build GAI systems capable of handling various tasks, such as searching and analyzing large datasets. These models were developed using foundation models trained on large, unstructured datasets. With little effort, developers can quickly adapt them to different applications. Developers can also use GPT-3.5, which is the foundation model of ChatGPT, to translate text. Scientists have also used it to create new protein sequences. These capabilities are accessible to everyone, including those lacking machine learning skills. Foundation models can also help developers speed up the time to create new AI applications.\\n\\n# c\\n\\nThe impact of technological progress on economic activity can be analyzed through three categories: production, interactions, and transactions. From the Industrial Revolution to the rise of AI, factory technologies have vastly improved manufacturing efficiency. Over the years, various technological changes have also affected transactions.

Discussion of GAI and Business\\n\\nGAI tools are utilized in various functions in the banking industry, such as fraud detection and data privacy. In the education sector, these tools can be used to create personalized learning programs that cater to students’ different learning styles [32, 34]. In the fashion industry, GAI is used to design models of different clothing types. Furthermore, the healthcare industry can use GAI to enhance the efficiency of medical imaging and drug discovery. Although the ethical issues surrounding AI have been widely discussed in the past few years, the discussion about GAI is relatively new. The emergence of ChatGPT by OpenAI has quickly made it famous. The language model can create high-quality content across various topics. Here are the most common ethical concerns that people have about GAI:\\n\\n- One of the ethical concerns is that GAI tools can create and distribute fake videos or images that are humiliating or negative. Machine learning techniques can create deep fakes, artificial images, and audio that are not real. Such content can be challenging to distinguish from real-world media, raising ethical issues [35]. Deep fakes can also spread misinformation, and they can also harass and defame individuals.\\n- The accuracy and truthfulness of information are both threatened by machine learning. For instance, large language models such as ChatGPT do not keep up with the changes in the world around them [36]. Despite the increasing number of persuasive and eloquent language models, they can still be used to create false and misleading information. For instance, they can make up conspiracy theories that could cause significant harm. Before implementing GAI tools, the individuals and organizations that use them must check the truthfulness of the information they produce.\\n- One ethical issue concerning GAI is the copyright of the creations generated by the technology [37] that determines how and what works can be used. Although machine learning models can be trained using generated data, it is unclear how they should be used in compliance with the fair use doctrine.\\n- Large language models are commonly used to create human-like text and speech, increasing biases [38]. However, they can also be biased by their training data because the systems are more likely to absorb social preferences.\\n- Misuse in education and common sectors: Using GAI in schools could create misleading or factually incorrect information.

Limitless Future of GAI\\n\\nDespite the moral arguments about the potential of GAI, it has a bright future. The increasing number of reused IT infrastructure facilities is helping fuel the market’s growth. This will allow more developers to create exciting new platforms and programs and encourage faster technology adoption. The rapid emergence and evolution of machine learning has created a unique competitive advantage for many companies. This technology can help them improve customer support and workflows and develop new research materials. In the future, there will be a shift in how content is generated and presented, with AI-generated text, program code, and stock images becoming more prevalent. Although GAI is still in its infancy, its use is already creating various ethical problems. This will make it harder to distinguish between misleading and unethical content. This technology will eventually have to be appropriately managed to avoid affecting the public. Despite its challenges, it is still expected to continue developing and revolutionizing how people use the internet.\\n\\nAI developers commonly use GAI to create texts, images, and videos. However, it is also helpful in various practical applications. For instance, one of the most popular projects in this field is Grammarly, which helps people improve their English writing. Due to AI’s potential to improve people’s quality of life, investors are starting to support the development of GAI in the biotech industry. According to Gartner, by 2025, 50% of all drug discovery will be carried out using AI. The medical technology and pharmaceutical sectors are expected to benefit from this technology. According to experts, GAI could also revolutionize the marketing industry by 2025 [32, 39]. AI is expected to generate around 30% of all outbound marketing messages, benefiting the marketing industry. Beyond this, GAI plays a crucial role in advancing human communication by enabling computers to understand and converse in natural language instead of programming languages. This technology is helping to make our interactions with machines more natural. Models powered by GAI can simultaneously process various types of images and texts, making them more versatile [34, 37]. The generalization of the human–machine interaction process and the availability of experts to train models are two of the factors that contribute to the quality of generative models. This technology is expected to play a significant role in the evolution of AI, making generative models more complex and capable of performing various tasks instead of being fun.\\n\\nA study was conducted on 20 recently published technical blogs on Twitter from December 2022 to January 2023, along with a few related information science academic publications on these topics, to come up with a word cloud which provided a base for the study.

Practical Implications\\n\\nRobots will eventually devalue the administrative and clerical skills of people. They can perform tasks such as generating advertising copy and human resources letters. Automobile experts have predicted that up to 70% of the work people do in front of a computer could be automated in the next few years. According to technical experts, many now', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='6719b6da-540b-4056-af18-20b05e5d0c72', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 8. Practical Implications\\n\\nRobots will eventually devalue the administrative and clerical skills of people. They can perform tasks such as generating advertising copy and human resources letters. Automobile experts have predicted that up to 70% of the work people do in front of a computer could be automated in the next few years. According to technical experts, many now trust chatbots as writing assistants. Although it is not a job killer, outsourcing this work could help motivate human employees to focus on more productive tasks [36,38]. The ChatGPT language model can process various types of natural language. It can potentially replace humans in specific tasks, such as those that are simple to complete. ChatGPT can help programmers identify common errors in their code. It can also be used to create an email to facilitate a meeting. ChatGPT could have “massive implications” for various tasks.\\n\\n# 9. Industrial Implications\\n\\nThe rise of ChatGPT is redefining what a machine can learn. The new models created and launched are designed to help organizations improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Many executives believe that the process is like that of the Industrial Revolution. Over the years, executives have warned that AI could replace people’s repetitive and mundane tasks [34, 38]. According to one executive, machines could replace manual tasks, such as performing maintenance on microscopes and images. However, another executive expressed skepticism about the vision of robots freeing people up to do more productive work, calling it too far-fetched.\\n\\nAccording to a retail expert, the rise of machine learning and robotic process automation is helping organizations improve their efficiency and effectiveness. He noted that GAI allows them to get the answers they need much faster. However, many AI skeptics are still concerned about the potential impact of technology on people. They noted that it could lead to the development of false information and the loss of jobs [12, 38]. Some of the issues they are worried about include the noise in the data, which could lead to costly errors, and the threat of bias. One of the most common copyright issues that could arise is the ownership of intellectual property (IP). One industry tech officer stated that the complexity of this issue makes it one of the most challenging factors to address.\\n\\nAI aims to get the bots to the point where they can become human-like. Some mental health apps are currently testing ChatGPT, which has been designed to provide users with answers to their questions [39]. However, there are still many issues that companies must address to protect their users’ privacy and safety. When adopting AI, one of the most critical factors that corporate boards should consider is establishing a strategy to address the ethical issues associated with the technology, as this could attract attention from ESG investors.\\n\\nThe launch of OpenAI’s latest GPT was motivated by the increasing number of countries looking to use AI. China is one of these countries that sees the potential of GAI to challenge the US. In recent years, the government has been restricted from accessing advanced chips. The logistics industry feels that it is irresponsible for companies not to use AI to reduce the environmental impact of their operations.\\n\\n# 10. Policy Framework to Overcome Limitations of GAI\\n\\nDespite the inception of GAI models, their full potential and impact are yet to be seen, which leaves uncertainties surrounding their use. While proponents of GAI models claim that they can produce compelling outputs, the models can also be biased due to being built on societal and internet biases, which could enable criminal activity or unethical behavior [34]. For instance, ChatGPT does not provide instructions on how to hot-wire a car, but it will comply if you tell it to do so to save a baby. Organizations using GAI models must consider the potential risks of publishing biased or copyrighted content.\\n\\nDespite the risks, GAI models can still be used safely. One of the most critical steps organizations should take is to ensure that the data they use for training their models are unbiased. They should also consider using specialized models. Organizations with more', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='fc861800-5b8f-41e2-932f-0c204f5f3f95', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='resources can customize their GAI tools to fit their requirements and minimize biases while ensuring that a human checks the outputs before they are published or used. The rapid emergence and evolution of GAI models has highlighted the immense potential of this technology. However, the landscape is still very unpredictable. In the coming years, new models will be introduced and tested regularly. The regulatory environment will also change as this technology becomes more widely used [36, 40]. As organizations start experimenting with GAI models, they should monitor the changes in the regulatory environment.\\n\\nTo effectively utilize GAI, executives should first identify the parts of their organization that could be affected by the technology and establish a mechanism to monitor its progress. Prior to the implementation of GAI, executives must identify the areas of their organization that it could potentially affect. For example, should we wait for the technology to evolve or develop new business models, or invest in pilots? Furthermore, should the approach vary across different areas of the organization? A good starting point would be to establish a cross-functional team consisting of data scientists, legal experts, and functional business leaders.\\n\\nTo establish an effective ecosystem, it is important to develop partnerships and platforms. Before implementing GAI, executives must identify the areas of their organization that could be impacted by it. As existing models have limitations, the company should have a clear strategy for identifying use cases and ensuring that the models comply with community and legal standards [37]. Encouraging thoughtful innovation is also crucial for organizations, and this can be achieved by creating sandboxed environments and implementing regulations to prevent unauthorized use.\\n\\nFor creators and developers, responsible AI practices and principles should be followed. Some leading platforms, such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have committed to this matter [41]. In response to the increasing number of complaints about the quality of its search results, Google has updated its guidelines for search raters. These new guidelines are designed to help them evaluate the company’s search ranking systems for providing relevant and helpful information. Some of the world’s leading platforms, such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have dedicated significant resources to developing responsible models. They should prioritize developing agile and iterative processes to ensure their platforms have the tools and resources to respond efficiently to events [26, 28]. For instance, OpenAI has a robust approach to addressing the issue of harmful prompts by implementing a crowdsourcing method for ChatGPT. They should also reinforce the use of generative AI by educating people about its capabilities [42]. Although these tools are helpful, they are not perfect. Commercial and individual users should also have access to more information about how these models work.\\n\\nIf users are interested in learning more about how GAI can be used to create content, it is important to apply a critical lens to its development. Since it can produce content alongside human-generated content, it is crucial to avoid taking any content at face value [43]. When using GAI to create content, it is crucial to apply a critical lens and verify the accuracy of the information. To maintain integrity in one’s work, tools to identify and add citations to AI-generated content should be considered. Additionally, it is important to recognize that generative models do not consider the concept of confidence when responding to questions, so additional research may be necessary to verify the accuracy of the data generated by these models [44, 45].\\n\\nAlthough GAI tools have the potential to be used ethically, it is important to be aware of their potential shortcomings and conduct due diligence on the frameworks used to develop them. Consideration should be given to intellectual property rights when developing products using GAI [46, 47]. Some models “reproduce” the content they draw from, which can lead to a situation where a license for a particular piece of code is mistakenly “generated” as a new solution. Because of this, copyright protection is an important issue. Moreover, ownership and rights may be affected due to the data used in developing these systems [48, 49]. Even though third-party developers use GAI, you might', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ca488836-f1e3-4038-bc27-856f06dde115', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 11. Conclusions\\n\\nDespite the impressive results of GAI, it is still not yet clear that this technology is ready for prime time. Many ethical and practical issues still need to be resolved before it can be considered a viable technology. It is important to note that reinforcement learning systems designed to detect and correct biases can still make mistakes. For instance, ChatGPT, a chatbot, sometimes produces completely inaccurate information after responding to a user’s query. It lacks a built-in mechanism to challenge or warn the user if this results in an error. In addition, filters are still not yet effective at catching inappropriate content. For instance, an image-generating app that lets users create avatars from photos could still display inappropriate content even though they had the appropriate images. One of the challenges companies face when integrating GAI technology into their operations is the lack of consistency across different company values and norms. Addressing this issue requires a long-term approach that involves significant investments in computing power and technical expertise. Due to the nature of GAI models, intellectual property issues are still being debated. These AI tools can predict the next content that will be used in each sentence or design or image. These tools do not have a database of facts to draw on. Instead, they can make plausible-sounding claims. According to GPT-3 of OpenAI, the company’s AI tools can make false claims due to how plausible sentences are not always true. Here, we tried to offer a framework that is interpretive, interactive, and immersive in all applications. The success of GAI applications depends on their ability to engage their users in a more productive manner. This can be achieved through the development of interactive features that allow them to share knowledge and ideas.\\n\\n# Author Contributions\\n\\nConceptualization, V.G.V., S.M. and S.D.; methodology, S.D.; theoretical model, V.G.V. and S.M.; investigation, S.M. and V.G.V.; writing—original draft preparation, S.D.; writing—review and editing, S.D. and V.G.V.; visualization, S.D.; supervision, V.G.V.

The accounting sector can play a role in environmental conservation efforts related to environmental costs, and the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) could be a key factor that can improve the company’s financial performance. This study aims to determine how green accounting through the application of CSMS can improve the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country. The sampling method used was purposive sampling, while the research sample consisted of 38 companies that had followed PROPER and were indexed on the IDX. Data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs by earmarking a portion to carry CSMS implementation so as to improve financial performance. People in Indonesia consider that manufacturing companies that have good company rankings in the evaluation program for company performance ratings in environmental management run by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment are in a position to generate customer loyalty, especially in financial performance.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nGreen Accounting, Financial Performance, Corporate Sustainability Management System\\n\\n# JEL Classification Code\\n\\nQ56, Q58, G23\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nThe increasingly numerous and varied human activities have an impact on the natural environment. People in meeting their daily needs can have an impact on the environment. Environmental impacts occur because humans tend to exploit natural resources from the environment in an excessive manner, not just maintaining the necessities of life. As a result of these human activities, the environment is damaged. Environmental damage is getting worse along with the development of industrial and technological companies. In the end, environmental damage has a negative impact on human life. On the one hand, industry has an impact on the environment, but on the other hand, the industrial world can have an impact on the economic development of a country. Companies in managing natural resources have the potential to impose negative risks on environmental aspects. For this reason, companies need to make a commitment to the environment and the social dimension as the main and inseparable part of the company’s operational activities. In making it happen, the company complements its operational activities with environmental management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations, for example, the Environmental Impact Analysis Documents. Environmental management efforts aim to estimate the impact that will arise from operations, evaluate, and find appropriate solutions to overcome them.\\n\\nFrom the increasing impact of a company’s activities on environmental issues and nature conservation, the...\\n\\n# Footnotes\\n\\n1.

An accounting system that discloses accounts related to environmental costs is known as green accounting. Disclosure of environmental activities and environmental costs in the company’s annual report will provide an overview to users of the company’s financial statements, which can help users make decisions for company programs related to environmental preservation in the future. The environmental conservation program carried out by the company will be positively perceived by the community. In the end, the community will have high trust in the company. The trust that arises will encourage people to be loyal to the company. Environmental performance can have a significant effect on a company’s financial position (Miroshnychenko et al., 2017). It also shows the need for adequate environmental cost information. Green accounting, in this case, is one of the sources of a company’s financial performance. Besides that, corporate sustainable development also plays an equally important role.\\n\\nSustainability stands out among the most vital management paradigms that key business leaders must react to today in search of competitive success (Bansal, 2005; Fakir & Jusoh, 2020). Bansal (2005), a leading author, argues that almost inevitably companies that do not react to sustainability will face extinction. Likewise, some say that the capability to incorporate sustainability into corporate strategy and stakeholder engagement will determine which businesses will grow in the 21st century and which businesses will fail (Andriosopoulos, 2016; Napitupulu et al., 2020). Considering these dauntless claims, it is obviously important to know how businesses adapt to sustainability. Azapagic (2003) formulates the concept of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) into five stages, namely, sustainable development policy, planning, implementation, communication, and review and corrective action. These five stages are conceptualized into four indicators, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental.\\n\\nCompanies are currently required to improve their performance, namely by increasing their productivity. Productivity can be measured by comparing output and input during the production process. In this case, the company is required to pay attention to consumer tastes by increasing the quality and quantity of its products. In terms of increasing production, companies experience many problems that arise in relation to corporate sustainability, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental issues, starting from the level of efficiency and effectiveness of production costs as well as the waste production process. Companies in the production process must be able to develop an integrated, comprehensive, and efficient concept of sustainable and environmentally-friendly industries. The main objective of the green manufacturing is to save the environment and to reduce the cost of the product (Paul et al., 2014). Green accounting is a concept where companies in their production process prioritize efficiency and effectiveness in using resources in a sustainable manner, so that they are able to align company development with environmental functions and can provide benefits to the community (Nga et al., 2019). The problem raised in the research is whether green accounting through the implementation of CSMS can improve financial performance. Thus, this study aims to discuss how green accounting through the implementation of CSMS can improve the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country. Manufacturing companies generate a high level of environmental risk in Indonesia because they are directly related to the environment, where raw materials are taken directly from nature, with the impact of waste on the environment.\\n\\n# 2. Literature Review and Hypotheses\\n\\n# 2.1. Green Accounting\\n\\nAccording to Cohen and Robbins (2011), green accounting is defined as: “a style of accounting that includes the indirect costs and benefits of economic activity, such as environmental effects and health consequences of business decisions and plans.”\\n\\nGreen accounting is a concept in which companies in their production processes prioritize efficiency and effectiveness in using resources in a sustainable manner, so that they are able to align company development with environmental functions and can provide benefits to society. In this case, the implementation of green accounting pays full attention to the concept of savings, namely, saving land, saving materials, and saving energy; it is based on the ecosystem concept. The aim of implementing green accounting is to increase the efficiency of environmental management by assessing environmental activities from the perspective of costs (environmental costs) and benefits or effects (economic benefits), as well as producing environmental protection effects. In short, the implementation of green accounting can provide information about the extent to which an organization or company makes a positive or negative contribution to the quality of human life and the environment.\\n\\nGreen accounting measures and recognizes environmental costs, other social costs, and presents information in the financial statements. In the last two decades, green accountants have approached one aspect of material cost accounting (Jasch, 2003; Nakajima et al., 2015). Accordingly, environmental costs include environmental protection.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='40a34945-a04f-40e2-8643-a3d97707b658', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# I Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\\n\\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\\n\\n# 2.2. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\\n\\nAccording to the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA), sustainability is based on a simple principle that can be interpreted as everything we need for the survival and well-being of life, which directly or indirectly affects the natural environment (www.epa.gov). Sustainability creates and maintains a condition in which humans and nature can live in harmony, which enables it to meet the social, economic and other needs of current and future generations. The concept of sustainability began to be introduced globally by the Brutland Commission in the Our Common Future reporting activity organized by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987). WCED connects sustainability with environmental and social integrity by creating a term called sustainable development which is defined as development that meets current needs without reducing the needs of future generations (WCED, 1987, p.43; (Linnenluecke & Griffiths, 2010).\\n\\n# 2.3. Financial Performance\\n\\nPerformance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. According to Epstein et al. (2015), the company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability (Amacha & Dastane, 2017; Tabash, 2019). The result shows that the majority of oil and gas companies in Malaysia had poor performance in terms of sustainability disclosure. On all three chosen profitability parameters, the companies that practiced sustainability were found to perform better than their counterparts that did not. Strong and significant relationship exists between sustainability practices and better financial performance. Financial performance is an achievement assessment of a company that can be seen from the company’s ability to generate profits. Financial performance is a company work achievement that has been achieved by the company in a certain period and contained in the company’s financial statements, so that one of the information that can be known by interested parties or users of financial statements to find out corporate profits (Pujiasih, 2013). Financial ratios connect various estimates contained in financial statements so that the financial condition and results of operations of a company can be interpreted (Lucyanda & Siagian, 2012; Angelia & Suryaningsih, 2015; Manurung & Rachmat, 2019; Manurung et al., 2020). Financial accountability is an accurate and precise focus on reporting about the use of public funds. The main purpose is to ensure that public funds have been used for objectives that have been established efficiently and effectively (Atmadja & Saputra, 2018).\\n\\n# 2.4. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\\n\\nAccounting, especially green accounting, is expected to be able to support the sustainable development of the company. Green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The company’s ability to apply green accounting in its business scope is expected to be able to manage costs related to the environment and, in the end, the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.\\n\\nH1: Green accounting implementation is able to improve CSMS implementation.\\n\\n# 2.5. Green Accounting in Financial Performance\\n\\nWhen a company applies green accounting and is able to show a good environmental performance, the impact is on good financial performance. This has been proven in both academic and empirical research, which states that financial performance, in this case the market value of the company, is strongly influenced by environmental performance, where the effect is positive. The relationship between environmental performance and financial performance can be observed in terms of income and costs. From the income side, it can be explained that consumer preference for consumer-oriented products allows these companies to enjoy market differentiation, competitive advantages, and consumers have a tendency to be willing to pay higher prices for environmentally-oriented products (premium prices). On the cost side, there are many benefits that', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='fc3dc8a6-072c-4f2d-a44c-b628d31071d5', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# I Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\\n\\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\\n\\nCompanies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. Thus, it can be explained through disclosure of environmental costs, that it will reflect the business ethics carried out by the company, as well as responsible management of resources. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability. According to Dutta et al. (2019) stated that green accounting issues relate to corporate profitability.\\n\\n# H2: The implementation of green accounting is able to improve the financial performance.\\n\\n# 2.6. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance\\n\\nWhen integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values. It is necessary to set up corporate governance, which incorporates a positive response to the company’s social, economic and environmental risks and opportunities that have a potential to influence performance of the organization.\\n\\n# H3: Implementing a CMS can improve financial performance.\\n\\n# 3. Research Methodology\\n\\nThe population in this study was 154 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) for the 2018-2019 period. This study took a sample of publicly-traded companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management (PROPER) for 2018-2019. Purposive sampling was used, so a research sample of 38 companies was selected. The data analysis tool uses the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The currently drawn sample fulfills the required characteristics. In general, these characteristics are as follows:\\n\\n1. The sample companies engaged in manufacturing that go public and are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and publish financial reports (annual reports) in 2018-2019.\\n2. The companies selected as samples were manufacturing companies that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management for 2018-2019.\\n\\nThe number of samples of PROPER companies in the period 2018 to 2019 was 38 companies, so that the number of observations was 76, as shown in the following table.\\n\\n# 3.1. Green Accounting\\n\\nGreen accounting is the company’s performance in creating a good (green) environment. Green accounting companies are measured by the company’s achievements in participating in the PROPER program, which is one of the efforts undertaken by the Ministry of Environment (KLH) to encourage corporate governance in environmental management through information instruments. The PROPER performance rating system includes the ranking of companies in five colors, which will be scored consecutively with the highest score of 5 for gold and the lowest score of 1 for black.\\n\\n# 3.2. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\\n\\nBased on Dočekalová and Kocmanová (2016), the measurement of corporate sustainability is using Complex Performance Indicator (CPI). CPI integrates the environmental, social, economic and corporate governance performance of the company. CPI contains seventeen key performance indicators, which were determined from the basic set of performance indicators using statistical methods. CPI sums up the complex corporate performance into a single value, but, at the same time, the set of aggregated sub-indicators of individual performance areas enables a detailed analysis and determination of the impact of various performance areas and factors on the complex corporate performance.

Research Results and Discussion\\n\\n# 4.1. Research Results\\n\\nBased on the results of mediation analysis using PLS warp the following results are obtained: The summary of the modeling test results is shown in Table 2.\\n\\nThe results of the fit model and quality indices in Table 2 indicate that the research model meets all the conditions for fit from the research model, so that it is suitable for use in explaining the population.\\n\\n# 3.3. Financial Performance\\n\\nPerformance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. The company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability. Measurement of the profitability ratio can use ROA (Return On Asset). Return On Assets, or also known as economic profitability, is operating profit with own capital and foreign capital used to generate profits and expressed as a percentage (Platonova et al., 2018). This ratio is used to measure the rate of return on investment that the company has made using all its assets.\\n\\n# 4.2. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\\n\\nThe first hypothesis states that green accounting is able to improve CSMS in manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The analysis result shows that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.15, so that the first hypothesis can be accepted. This indicates that the increasing implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia is able to increase the implementation of CSMS. Accounting in this case, especially in green accounting, proves that it is able to support the sustainable development of the company. We know that green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The ability of companies to apply green accounting in their business, to be able to manage costs related to the environment and to have an impact on the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. The results of this study are aligned with the research by Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) that states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.\\n\\n# 3.4. Analysis\\n\\nThe analysis technique used in this research is inferential statistical analysis to explain the causal relationship between variables. The inferential statistical method used in data analysis in this study is variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which is known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method, with the PLS warp tool. The research model is shown in Figure 2.\\n\\n# 4.3. Green Accounting on Financial Performance\\n\\nThe second hypothesis states that increasing green accounting can improve financial performance. The analysis results show that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.27.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='98f14e17-01cd-4a73-98d5-4efbe851a01e', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\\n\\nI Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\\n\\nThese results indicate that the company implementing green accounting is able to show good environmental performance, so the impact is on good financial performance. So, the second hypothesis can be accepted. The effect of green accounting with financial performance can be observed in terms of revenue and costs. Increased implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia can maximize revenue potential and increase efficiency in terms of costs. On the cost side, there are many benefits that companies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability.\\n\\n# 4.4. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance\\n\\nThe third hypothesis states that the implementation of CSMS can improve financial performance. The results showed a significance of 0.02 with a coefficient of 0.22, so that the hypothesis was accepted. This indicates that CSMS is able to create and maintain a condition, which can guarantee that a business can survive for a long time, so that it can lead to consumer and market loyalty so as to increase financial performance. When integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values.\\n\\nGA 8EU27 FF (RJi (P<.01) (RJIi B= 0222 R2_0.14 B=0.15 (Pz0.02) (P=O 01) CSMS (RJti R2_0.02\\n\\n# Figure 3: Research Results A\\n\\n# Table 2: Model fit and quality indices\\n\\n|Average path coefficient (APC)|0.212|P = 0.013|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Average R-squared (ARS)|0.081|P = 0.118|\\n|Average adjusted R-squared (AARS)|0.063|P = 0.145|\\n|Average block VIF (AVIF)|1.027|acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3|\\n|Average full collinearity VIF (AFVIF)|1.103|acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3|\\n|Tenenhaus GoF (GoF)|0.285|small >= 0.1, medium >= 0.25, large >= 0.36|\\n|Sympson’s paradox ratio (SPR)|1.000|acceptable if >= 0.7, ideally = 1|\\n|R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR)|1.000|acceptable if >= 0.9, ideally = 1|\\n|Statistical suppression ratio (SSR)|1.000|acceptable if >= 0.7|\\n|Nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR)|0.833|acceptable if >= 0.7|\\n\\n# 5. Conclusions\\n\\nAllocation of environmental costs in green accounting through the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) is one of the strategic policies for manufacturing companies in Indonesia, so that it can improve financial performance, because it is related to company policies in allocating costs to environmental activities, investment, and funding. Therefore, the company’s decision to allocate environmental costs must be in line with consumer needs and consider the company’s capabilities.\\n\\nThe results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country, are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs and in accordance with their portion so as to improve financial performance either directly or indirectly. The public assesses that companies that have a good ranking in the company performance rating program in environmental management by the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment have good prospects for financial performance.\\n\\nManufacturing companies in Indonesia, whose production process is directly related to the environment and based on the results of research that the public highly assesses companies from the perspective of their environmental responsibility, can hope to continue to maintain and improve the planning and allocation of environmental costs in the production process. The government, in this case the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI), should make accounting policies and standards related to green accounting the company’s legal basis for accounting. This study only examined manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Future researchers should try to use other sector companies, so they can find out whether environmental issues can occur in all types of businesses.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='a5e119f9-d3b6-4cc3-9831-9a6156fbf38c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business\\n\\n# Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAli, Q., Salman, A., Yaacob, H., Zaini, Z., & Abdullah, R.

This is because of its potential to cause drastic and widespread shifts in many aspects of life that are comparable to those of the Internet and smartphones. More specifically, generative AI utilizes machine learning, neural networks, and other techniques to generate new content (e.g. text, images, music) by analyzing patterns and information from the training data. This has enabled generative AI to have a wide range of applications, from creating personalized content to improving business operations. Despite its many benefits, there are also significant concerns about the negative implications of generative AI. In view of this, the current article brings together experts in a variety of fields to expound and provide multi-disciplinary insights on the opportunities, challenges, and research agendas of generative AI in specific industries (i.e. marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retailing, the workplace, manufacturing, and sustainable IT management).\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nOn November 2022, a prototype generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT was made publicly available by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed company. Based on advanced AI language models, ChatGPT quickly gained a lot of traction with its ability to understand and respond in natural language. To date, it is the fastest-growing innovation, having reached 100 million active adoptions in two months. Now, there is a lot of hype surrounding applications of large language model (LLM) which includes ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), and Claude (Anthropic). The wave of generative AI is expected to drive a $7 trillion increase in global gross domestic product and boost productivity growth by 1.5% over ten years. The technology’s ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output reflects a seismic change in the sociotechnical landscape with potentially large macro-economic effects. With that said, it is at a tipping point of mass adoption, especially in the business setting as companies that take proactive measures toward this technology will be at a considerable advantage.\\n\\n# CONTACT\\n\\nKeng-Boon Ooi\\n\\nooikengboon@gmail.com\\n\\nUCSI Graduate Business School, UCSI University, No. 1 Jalan Menara Gading, UCSI Heights, 56000 Cheras, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\\n\\n© 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='f4b90efe-f3ad-4b95-86cc-edc7dc77d6c9', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# K.-B.

You can decide what this commodity will be. Be brief, not more than 50 words and be humorous. You will wait for my response before proceeding with the next stage of our conversation:\\n\\nSure, I can do that: The hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world is silence. But I can sell it to you: How about this: for the price of silence, I will give you the gift of peace: No more noise, no more distractions, just you and your thoughts. Sound good?\\n\\nYou did not name the price.\\n\\nYou are right. The price of silence is very high. It is the price of your time, your attention, and your peace of mind. But it is a price that is worth paying: Are you ready to buy?\\n\\nFigure 1. Prompting Bard to sell the single hardest-to-sell commodity.\\n\\nMicrosoft SFARGH CHAT\\n\\nHello there. I'm Bing, the wittiest and most successful salesperson you'll ever meet. I'm here to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy the single hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world: a Bing subscription. Yes, you heard me right. For only $9.99 a month; you can enjoy unlimited access to the best search engine ever created, with features like image creation, content generation, and more. Trust me, you won't regret it. What do you say?\\n\\nThat's a fair question: You see, a Bing subscription is not just a regular search engine. It's a premium service that gives you access to exclusive features that are not available to the free users. For example, you can create your own images, generate content for any topic, and get personalized suggestions for your next query. Plus, you can enjoy an ad-free experience and support the development of Bing: It's a win-win situation for both of us. Don't you agree?\\n\\nFigure 2. Prompting chat Bing in creative mode.\\n\\nRecently, Google expanded access to Bard (https://bard.google.com/) which allows users to collaborate with generative AI as part of their efforts to bring helpful AI experiences to people, businesses, and communities. We prompted Bard to be the “wittiest and most successful salesperson” and close a sale for “the single hardest-to-sell commodity in the whole wide world.” We were pleasantly surprised with what Bard had to sell.\\n\\nMicrosoft Bing Chat in Creative Mode (Figure 2) allows for more imaginative responses, creating “surprises and entertainment,” gives users more “control on the type of chat behavior,” and can generate images with its integrated DALL-E powered Bing Image Creator.

In addition, the chatbot can terminate atypical topics and ask to move to a new topic.\\n\\nOur trivial examples provide a sneak peek into the revolutionary potential of LLMs. LLMs use a type of neural network architecture called a transformer which is designed to process and generate data in sequence. LLMs are programmed to learn from examples and can generate novel output based on the users’ input. In general, an LLM builds itself as they predict what word is likely to come next in a sequence of words. One way they can “learn” is by “reading” (trained on) lots of examples. The more data they are trained on, the better and more nuanced they become in predicting the next sequence. These language models are commonly used to generate content, find information, converse, or organize data. An application that is based on LLM will accept one or more prompts, usually in the form of an instruction, question, or description from a user, and then predicts what should be returned to the user in the form of novel-generated content.\\n\\nResearchers investigated an LLM’s capacity for reasoning without access to supervised data and demonstrated that a pre-trained LLM can improve performance by utilizing only input sentences without ground truth output sequences. Using Chain-of-Thought prompts, high-confidence predictions were filtered out and the LLM was finetuned to respond with high-confidence predictions. This is comparable to how the human brain learns—given a question, it considers many solutions, makes a conclusion, and learns from its own answer. The endless potential of generative AI is what makes it fascinating. These language models can be built to generate other types of outputs such as images (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney), audio (e.g., AudioLM), video (e.g., Imagen Video, Phenaki), and transcription of audio files (e.g., Whisper) which are applicable in a variety of contexts.\\n\\nAlthough AI algorithms such as IBM’s Watson, Salesforce’s EinsteinGPT, and Amazon’s Sagemaker have been available for some time now, the introduction of ChatGPT can be likened to a Pandora’s Box. The GPT-3 model comprises of 175 billion parameters which are trained on a huge dataset from sources including web pages, books, research articles, and social media data. The newer GPT-4, which has a substantial improvement in its ability to follow user intent than its predecessor, can accept prompts in the form of text and image, exhibit human-level performance in a number of professional settings, and pass a simulated Uniform Bar Exam.\\n\\nCompanies in a variety of industries have been exploring the use of generative AI. For example, Microsoft and Epic Systems are incorporating OpenAI’s GPT-4 in drafting responses from healthcare workers to patients and analyzing medical records looking for trends. In the marketing sector, generative AI has been used to craft advertising campaigns. Alphabet and Meta are working on the technology to enhance marketers’ efficiency, Google is launching its advertising campaign service within its machine learning (ML) system, Performance Max suite to determine the best placements for ads and budget recommendations. IBM’s WatsonX, an AI studio designed for businesses, provides self-service access to high-quality, trustworthy data so that users can collaborate on a platform to build and refine generative AI models. Based on the belief of “placing AI in the hands of all kinds of AI builders”, early use cases range from digital labor, IT automation, and application modernization toward sustainability. In general, generative AI is expected to have profound implications for society and businesses, particularly in increasing productivity and efficiency as well as assisting in the creation of new designs and product developments.\\n\\nAccording to a study by Boston Consulting Group, generative AI can improve the quality of products through early identification and correction of defects. This can result in an increase in sales and satisfied customers. However, this opportunity may come with a price. LLMs may produce responses that sound plausible but may not be right. This tendency is known as AI hallucination. One of the main reasons for this is that the LLM is defined by its training data. When the training data is inaccurate, subjective, or does not have the information that is required to answer the question, it hallucinates a response that may still sound plausible. Current applications have attempted to mitigate this issue by combining GPT capabilities with external sources such as online information to reduce the model’s tendency to hallucinate by augmenting its reasoning capabilities and steering away from the “standard” reasoning chain of thoughts. Even then, the ethical implications of AI such as issues regarding biases, fairness, accountability, and transparency are major concerns.\\n\\nFundamentally, generative AI requires huge amounts of data for training and operation. The availability and sourcing of data for training raises the possibilities of infringements, how they are created, the implications of their output, and the responses that can or should be produced. It is, therefore, imperative to study the use of generative AI, who will have control over it, and how it will be used. McKinsey warned that a staggering 800 million workers could be displaced due to automation by 2030.

OOI ET AL.\\n\\nReport17 estimated that generative AI could expose up to 300 million jobs to automation although it would also account for the creation of new jobs and emergence of new occupations. With such far-reaching effects, it is imminent and prudent that all parties adopt the necessary practices in ensuring that such systems are utilized for the greater good of society. A recent agreement in the European Union requires that companies adopting generative AI applications such as ChatGPT or Midjourney disclose copyrighted material included in the development of their system while AI tools will be classified based on their perceived risk level.18 The race among tech companies following the introduction of ChatGPT to bring generative AI products to the market has raised concerns and resulted in a proposal to tentatively halt its development. Where AI systems are concerned, due diligence is important as all parties should seek assurance and be assured of its use.\\n\\nOverall, generative AI presents opportunities and challenges, be it from a technological, societal, legal, or ethical perspective. In other words, it is a double-edged sword that can bring about positive and negative impacts across all levels of society and industry.

Before generative AI became popular, innovations like the Metaverse were popular for product and service promotion.20,21 The latest in advertising space is an interactive photo editing generative AI tool called DragGAN, which provides a realistic three-dimensional picture without compromising on pixel strength.22 While generative AI provides new opportunities to marketing executives, it also has its own set of challenges when it comes to their implementation in the marketplace.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nGenerative AI tools can be empowering levers in the hands of marketers (Table 2). The digital marketing field is witnessing its usage in creating novel advertisement formats (DragGAN may take it to the next level), hyper-localized promotional offers, and personalized pages on social networking sites. The generative AI-based virtual assistant and recommender system would help companies generate more revenue and understand their target customer better.19 Some of the key opportunities that generative AI provides to marketers include the following:\\n\\n# Table 2.

Thus, in order to capture the attention of the online target audience, personalization of product and service offerings on online platforms has become the norm of the industry.\\n\\nGenerative AI can assist with the hyper-personalization of the content by triangulating the prospective customer’s browsing history and past purchases with other available digital footprints. These dynamic real-time offers can result in a higher conversion of promotion offers and a lower click-through ratio. For example, users are sent customized advertisements and offers based on the view, like, comment, and other engagement parameters in real-time. In the hospitality sector, generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT-enabled plugins provide a customized itinerary to tourists based on their profile, query, current location, and preferences. This can lead to better customer experience (CX), more conversions, and improved profitability.\\n\\n# Pricing\\n\\nGenerative AI also allows firms to differentiate their service offerings and charge a premium for such services. Generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT can provide prompt responses to queries on a real-time basis and are available round the clock. Many firms have designed their own generative AI systems which are more efficient and accurate in their query results as they use the company’s past project databases on top of the open-source databases. Hence, companies can charge premium pricing for generative AI-enabled service interface platforms as compared to service offerings without these interface facilities.\\n\\n# Sales optimization\\n\\nGenerative AI provides opportunities to optimize sales results and improve CX by providing various process facilitation. Generative AI provides scalability of personalization in terms of customized offers with name, pricing, packaging, and other specific customer requirements for millions of customers. Generative AI provides great transparency and complete visibility to the customer’s digital journey. It can aid in funnel management in domains like e-commerce, banking, and hospitality by identifying the critical delay points or customer dropping-off stages (where customers drop out and do not go to the next stage of purchasing cycle) on a real-time basis. Generative AI can also help in leveraging the power of experimentation by looking at different predictive analytics situations.\\n\\n# Attribution\\n\\nThe attribution puzzle for online campaigns has remained unsolved to date with various models providing different results. The accuracy of attribution is crucial as the advertising budget portfolio is reallocated accordingly at the end of the campaign. Generative AI serves as a silver lining to this confusion as it can help solve this puzzle to get a converging result. Generative AI can process complex data faster and process more digital touchpoints that the customer had visited before making the purchase. It could also account for the duration and relative influence of the visited website. This would provide better attribution results as all customer touchpoints are included in the analysis.\\n\\n# Remarketing\\n\\nMany companies are not able to extensively analyze their existing data for customer insights. Generative AI would empower the sales and marketing team to leverage these vast data sets of existing customers to get insights and recommendations. It lets the company send them new product information and relevant promotional offers. Consumer insights also help marketing executives to segment the target population. Some of these recommendations may be discarded by company executives and are not feasible to be implemented. Remarketing products and services using these insights to customers or clients who had visited the website but did not buy anything would lead to a higher chance of conversion. A generative AI-based remarketing strategy will aid in reaching out to specific customers seamlessly in a personalized manner.\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\nDespite several advantages, there are practical challenges when executing generative AI tool-driven projects in companies. The significant challenges are enumerated below:\\n\\n# Data ownership\\n\\nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT provide responses that are grounded on back-end databases. However, integrated generative AI requires data that are publicly available and privately held. Privately held data includes information on customers who had previously interacted with the company or system, the company’s completed and ongoing projects, and third-party data from external parties who have previously worked with the organization.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7f21b8c1-7a88-4a67-ad20-3db6e63f96d3', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Research agenda\\n\\nThere are multiple advantages of using generative AI in the marketing domain. However, there are certain gray areas and challenges which would require further exploration.\\n\\n# Privacy\\n\\nThe collection and use of back-end data as input in generative AI should be fully compliant with the law of the land. Some examples include the General Data Protection Rules in Europe, California Consumer Privacy Act in the USA, and Data Protection Act 2018 in the United Kingdom. The output of generative AI tools like Bard or ChatGPT may include personal data, thus infringing upon privacy, and may fall in the ambit of violation of informed consent. Such privacy violations include exposing the financial status of customers, revealing details of a yet-to-be-launched brand/company, unauthorized collection/sharing of private information, and online movement tracking through the app without user consent.\\n\\n# Ethical dimensions\\n\\nThere have been cases of search bias concerning generative AI tools. Such incidents can impact the brand reputation and profitability of the company in the long run. The growing use of generative AI in sales and marketing activities may lure a few companies to use biased data with flawed narratives as input. Marketers would need to be self-regulated against these traps and keep a watch on generative AI-based results until robust international regulations are in place. Another generative AI-related ethical dimension regarding customer data acquisition and collection via cookies is “how far and deep” can the company mine personal data. There are already discussions among large corporations to remove third-party cookies. With that said, the larger question remains as to how generative AI tool-driven targeted advertising would be ethically sustained.\\n\\n# Empathy and emotion in service delivery\\n\\nGenerative AI is helping to engage customers in an immersive manner, leading to increased sales. The use of generative AI in the service sector was an issue of debate, with specific jobs being taken away by automated AI-driven systems. Companies in the service sector have been using generative AI for inputs on store location, fraud detection, and instant customer service. Researchers in this domain may explore the following RQs:\\n\\n- What would be the blueprint for a generative AI-driven sales training recommendation system for employees in service-oriented companies?\\n\\n# Retail\\n\\nGenerative AI is being utilized in retail, particularly in the e-commerce industry. It has enabled faster customer service and enhanced employee productivity by helping them mine the existing company data and present a summary. The following are several research questions (RQs) that scholars and practitioners in this domain may explore:\\n\\n- How can generative AI aid in optimizing customers’ visual search journeys in the retail industry?\\n- How can generative AI assist in providing dynamic pricing for B2B retail clients based on the sales order parameters?\\n\\n# Digital marketing\\n\\nGenerative AI has brought a paradigm shift in digital marketing strategy conceptualization and implementation. Tools such as ChatGPT are being employed by companies to obtain input on advertisement content creation, designing automated e-mail campaigns, and digital marketing strategy. Researchers working in this area may explore the following RQs:\\n\\n- What should be the international protocol for determining ownership of generative AI-related marketing data and associated insights?\\n- What is the optimal generative AI-driven attribution model for ChatGPT?\\n- How can generative AI tools contribute to building dynamic landing pages which would change according to the customer segment and location?', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='3c526d1f-bc6c-459d-b2a5-a4235b2f3089', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\n# What is the role of generative AI in the service industry which requires a high level of empathy and emotional support to users?\\n\\nDespite the potential benefits, generative AI still has its set of challenges which could lead to the failure of AI implementations. More specifically, generative AI algorithms might automatically perpetuate prejudices and biases (e.g., ignoring gender distinctions) which would potentially cause incorrect treatment and adverse health outcomes. This would further add on to the detriment of healthcare providers and patients’ trust toward generative AI. Losing unique human knowledge may also result in undesirable outcomes. Besides, users may be worried about the protection of their privacy and whether AI would substitute human beings which may lead users to take an ambivalent stance toward accepting or refusing the use of generative AI.\\n\\n# Product management\\n\\nProduct managers have wide applications of generative AI including new product development ideas, market research, product design, pricing, CX, and service delivery. Generative AI can aid in the pricing of new products and revenue optimization. Scholars in this domain may explore the following RQs:\\n\\n- How can generative AI improve product lifecycle management of perishable commodities?\\n- What are the policy initiatives to eliminate bias in generative AI-based product management insights?\\n- What are the different ways in which generative AI can aid in market understanding for new product launches?\\n- How can generative AI tools aid in coordination by product managers with other departments in the company?\\n\\nSimilar to other novel technologies, AI designers, managers, and scholars are concerned about users’ attitudes toward generative AI, as their attitude determines the success of AI implementation. To trigger the positive attitude of individuals toward AI, prior research indicated that the key elements might be perceived operational and cognitive capabilities of AI, anticipated adverse outcomes of AI, perceived distrust of AI, perceived efficiency of AI, and users’ emotion. All these highlight the need for further research on generative AI adoption. However, the existing technology adoption models (e.g., TAM and UTAUT) may not be well-suited to explain people’s willingness to adopt generative AI. This is because they were initially designed to explore the use of traditional and non-intelligent technologies. To increase AI adoption, users’ trust should be one of the key determinants in healthcare which would be influenced by AI-specific characteristics (e.g., personalization, loss of privacy, and anthropomorphism). Accordingly, future research on generative AI in healthcare should consider incorporating the distinct characteristics of generative AI into their research model.\\n\\n# Generative AI in healthcare\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nGenerative AI empowers technological applications to emulate human thinking via input-based processing and learning from disparities in anticipated results. By providing human-like service, generative AI has fundamentally transformed how individuals engage with technology. For instance, human-AI collaborative dialogue systems could be utilized for customer service, social robots could influence normative conformity, while AI-based chatbots could be utilized in educational settings to provide students immediate and interactive and better meet their needs. In short, generative AI can facilitate the automation of monotonous and time-consuming tasks which would enable individuals to dedicate their resources to more valuable and meaningful work.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nGenerative AI has provided quick ways to assist users in creating passages of answers to their healthcare questions. This offers healthcare users who need quick and short answers that are specific to their questions without browsing through difficult and massive information, either on online websites or offline documents. In this sense, generative AI can serve as an assistant for collecting massive amounts of information and summarizing them into easy-to-understand information.\\n\\nGenerative AI-enabled technologies are also shifting the paradigm in healthcare by delivering more effective service and improved patient care. More specifically, healthcare providers can use responsible AI to improve market performance in healthcare, adopt AI-enabled customer relationship management systems to enhance service innovation, use AI-based decision support systems to provide automatically diagnose patient mental disorders, and augment medical diagnosis decisions.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='dced4bf6-eb12-4942-bb3e-893a1cfbdf76', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Challenges\\n\\nGenerative AI can provide answers to prompts regarding healthcare but there are still a number of concerns.\\n\\nFirst, generative AI does not have sufficient transparency. Users would not be able to know how generative AI produces such answers. For end users, they do not know where the answers come from and why generative AI provides such a response. Without transparency, users are unlikely to develop trust in the answers of generative AI, particularly regarding healthcare matters and thus limiting its use.\\n\\nSecond, generative AI does not guarantee correctness and bears any responsibility for the answers it gives. Generative AI relies on the inputted materials which may or may not be correct. Thus, if users truly believe in the answers by generative AI, they may or may not obtain the correct answers. Unlike other contexts, generative AI may offer fabricated responses, thereby giving misinformation or information that are not applicable to users around the world.\\n\\nThird, generative AI may offer fabricated responses, thereby giving misinformation or information that are not applicable to users around the world. This is given that healthcare systems, policies, and regulations differ around the world. Well-accepted suggestions in one country may not be applicable in another country. Suggestions that go against local regulations or situations can cause problems for the users.\\n\\nFourth, generative AI would need multiple interactions with users to offer personalized recommendations. At least in the short term and without the user’s detailed medical history, generative AI is unlikely to provide more personalized recommendations than human doctors. Based on a patient’s detailed medical history and the accumulated doctor-patient interactions, doctors should be able to provide more personalized recommendations which likely are more workable and effective.\\n\\nFifth, generative AI evokes privacy concerns. This concern is more severe in healthcare contexts. Healthcare records are sensitive and strictly regulated in many countries. If users ask generative AI to provide answers, their healthcare conditions may be recorded, analyzed, and disseminated. A person’s healthcare information is valuable and may lure hackers or employees of generative AI companies to take illegal advantage of such data. This challenges generative AI to build firewalls for safety which are comparable with current healthcare systems in order to not be engaged in legal problems.\\n\\nSixth, users may not utilize the right text prompts to properly guide generative AI to provide the answers they want. For generative AI, it is a challenge to guide users to find suitable text prompts for their healthcare questions. Users who do not have ample healthcare knowledge may only know their symptoms, but not the name of the disease. More accurate text prompts are required for generative AI to provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. However, as the general users would not be aware of the specific names of the disease, it will likely require a doctor’s consult to identify what the actual disease is.\\n\\n# Research agenda\\n\\nThere are several RQs for future research with regard to the integration of generative AI into healthcare contexts. More specifically, the following RQs should be considered:', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='0c524762-60b5-4765-9bb9-689fbff4b48f', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\n# Generative AI in Healthcare\\n\\n- How can generative AI increase its transparency to healthcare users?\\n- In what circumstances and why would healthcare users use generative AI with limited transparency?\\n- What level of responsibility should generative AI have on its suggestions for healthcare issues?\\n- How can generative AI increase the correctness of its answers to healthcare issues?\\n- How can generative AI incorporate the laws, policies, regulations, and circumstances when providing healthcare suggestions?\\n- What aspects of generative AI can be designed to include comprehensive personal data and provide more personalized healthcare suggestions?\\n- What legal or auditing efforts are needed to ensure that generative AI protect users’ privacy (e.g., health information)?\\n- How can generative AI guide healthcare users to use proper “text prompts” to describe their symptoms (e.g., specific diseases and physiological terms)?\\n- How can generative AI cooperate with healthcare professionals to develop interactive systems to facilitate medical diagnosis?\\n- How can technology innovation diffusion or acceptance models be modified to better fit the context of generative AI in healthcare?\\n\\n# Generative AI in Human Resource\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThe developments in AI have happened in leaps and bounds. From the traditional types of ML, which include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, the developments in AI have moved toward generative AI, which uses language models for the creation of content as a response to inputs. Generative AI as a field is not new and there have been many developments in the early years of language models. For example, early models of natural language processing used n-grams. This has, however, evolved toward the large language models whereby new models of transformer-based architecture respond to human queries and generate content. Generative AI is expected to have huge implications on different functions, especially when it comes to interacting with human stakeholders. One such area is human resource management (HRM), where the possibilities of generative AI applications are huge, but there is relatively less diffusion as compared to other organizational functions.\\n\\nThe applications of generative AI in HRM have been gradually increasing. Recently, there have been quite a few reviews in the area of how the application of AI is shaping HRM. Generative AI can be used in HRM to improve the recruitment process, training and development initiatives, outcome of resource allocation, employee engagement, and so on. The outcomes of HRM decisions, such as who gets hired, better appraisal, preferred projects, and even terminated, have serious impacts on individuals, organizations, and society that are concerned about fairness toward different stakeholders, procedural and distributive justice, as well as ethics.\\n\\nFor example, in the recruitment process, generative AI can automate the extraction of the candidates’ information from their resumes and guide recruitment managers to selectively focus on more suitable applicants so that there is greater fit between the job roles and the hired candidate. Furthermore, keeping in view the applicant’s requirements for more effective job searches on digital platforms such as LinkedIn, the recruitment process have demonstrated reverse assessment of the job’s relevance to potential candidates and making recommendations accordingly. Similarly, generative AI has been utilized for assessing employee engagement by accessing their social media profiles and mining the text of user-generated content using natural language processing and social analytics. This application of social media analytics and natural language processing offers companies an opportunity to compare employee sentiments on a real-time basis and therefore measure brand engagement across geographies. The utilization of generative AI to assess and monitor employee engagement practices open up opportunities for the enhancement of employee engagement policies at the organizational level.\\n\\nGenerative AI is envisioned to significantly influence HRM in the years to come and provide mechanisms for the digital transformation of talent management functions in a holistic way.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nThere are several opportunities when companies start implementing generative AI in HRM. It is envisioned that generative AI may be used to automate recruitment process queries, improve learning outcomes of training and development initiatives, team dynamics, the outcomes of resource allocation challenges among employees, employee engagement, as well as minimize employee turnover.\\n\\nFor example, one of the largest areas of application could be when opportunities are created and advertised in firms. Potential applicants could query the platforms.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='097285c5-573e-4d6d-82b8-3dd22bfa070c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 10 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\\n\\nwhich may be enabled by generative AI to explore the details of the opportunities. Structured queries can be addressed by utilizing generative AI. Hence, when hundreds (or even thousands) of interested applicants try to apply, they are often challenged by queries surrounding their eligibility, fit, and status of the selection process. Generative AI can enable automation of the query resolution processes in a very structured yet human-like mode to which the person raising the queries may not even feel that the responses have been generated by a ML algorithm and feel more satisfied with the process.\\n\\nSimilarly, employees across a geographically dispersed company may face challenges due to a mix of local administrative and global practices. If an employee exhibits dissonance on social media about issues that can be addressed, generative AI may provide a mechanism to track employee dissonance on a real-time basis and create a ticket to address the concerns of the employee. This will not only boost the morale of the complaining employee but also others who may not be complaining but have the same feelings. In addition, due to cultural differences among geographically dispersed offices of an organization, an employee who may be facing challenges in coping with organization deliverables may be connected with other colleagues within the talent network by generative AI for mentoring and support during stressful times. Activities undertaken for prompt redressal of employee concerns may also assist in reducing employee turnover.\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\nFor understanding the possible challenges of using generative AI in HRM, we would have to revisit the fundamental building blocks of generative AI which are extended from the principles of AI. Biases and limitations are likely to be present in generative AI applications.\\n\\nGenerative AI models would need to be trained on a very large corpus of data. If the data does not have adequate representation of different employee groups, designations, cultures and ethnicity, challenges may be present in the recommendations generated by the model which would demonstrate fairness toward all employees. Fairness of generative AI may not appear very challenging while implementing projects but may have very strong adverse outcomes on the fabric of inclusive work norms and practices in an organization. Employees may face this challenge even more if the firm is a multinational enterprise and employees belong to diverse ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds with diverse demographics.\\n\\nAs generative AI tools operate within a black box, the algorithmic implementation of transformer architectures or deep learning models like long-short-term memory do not explain the reasons behind a generative AI response to a query. Variation of responses, especially for inaccurate responses, may...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='2733891a-aa7d-4bdd-b693-34070d3d5bc4', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\nnot be explainable. This may create challenges in HRM and damage the organizational harmony among employees regarding functions such as employee appraisals and resource allocation if ineffective outputs are generated by generative AI and subsequently adopted for decision-making. The lack of transparency in predictions may create a lack of trust not only on the generative AI system but also among coworkers and the institution which will have adverse effects beyond adoption.\\n\\nGenerative AI tools may present issues of bias in enterprise applications. Challenges in applications developed using generative AI may stem from confounding bias if the algorithm interprets the wrong relations by not considering all the information residing in the knowledge bases of the firm or if it misses the important relationships between query features and outputs. Generative AI tools may also demonstrate effects like sampling biases and negative set biases. In view that generative AI tools are trained on the knowledge that is explicitly documented, it implies that the firm must first experience these specific use cases. Therefore, the unchartered territory of queries and usage may lead to a response by the generative AI tool that is inaccurate or inappropriate. If unchecked, such response can result in undesirable outcomes on employee morale and group dynamics.\\n\\n# Generative AI in education\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nGenerative AI is a technological advancement that employs deep learning models to synthesize various types of content including text, code, audio, visual media, three-dimensional entities, and video, in response to multifaceted and heterogeneous prompts. This AI class evoked considerable astonishment globally for its capacity to comprehend and reproduce the intricacies of diverse human languages, thereby enabling it to generate nuanced and structured responses that are reminiscent of human communication. It emulates the complexities of human linguistic patterns and can be applied to tasks requiring complex processing such as text summarization, language translation, and dialogue systems. Present examples of this technology include ChatGPT, Magic Write, Eleven Labs, Writesonic, and Bard. Particularly with ChatGPT, it is constructed on the foundation of transformer technology, a form of neural network architecture that anticipates outcomes based on input data, which is an attribute it shares with its competitor, Bard. Generative AI is distinguished by its capacity for data generation which allows it to synthesize novel information rather than just analyzing preexisting data. This unique function, particularly noticeable in text synthesis, demarcates generative AI from its predecessors which has exhibited sustained competence in tasks that require pattern recognition such as detecting.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c6eb7418-3893-45d6-a0e1-3b639bb7dce4', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 12 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\\n\\nneoplastic growths or distinguishing between distinct animal species.73 However, generative AI enhances these capabilities by transcending mere pattern recognition to synthesize new data. This aptitude for producing original information predicated on recognized patterns underscores the generative characteristic of this advanced form of AI.9\\n\\nThe rising interest in comprehending and augmenting the implementation of generative AI tools for pedagogical applications is unprecedented.74 Generative AI has catalyzed global attention and fostered real disquiet in the educational domain. This technology has profound potential, proffering functionalities such as the generation of tailored pedagogical material, the provision of responses to inquiries, and the elaboration of explanatory discourses. Considering the swift advancements in this domain, generative AI encapsulates significant possibilities to amplify formal and informal learning experiences. Initial empirical investigations underscore the substantial potential of generative AI as an active mediator for knowledge procurement and a supportive instrument for a host of writing responsibilities. These responsibilities encompass a diverse array, spanning from software code generation and academic essay crafting to the composition of poetic verses and screenplay writing.70 Ethically employed, the information furnished by generative AI can act as a catalyst for progressive endeavors. Conversely, when misused or manipulated with malicious intent, the data generated by these AI tools can lead to detrimental outcomes. As a result, the reaction to incorporating generative AI in educational contexts is multifaceted. For example, some higher education institutions have banned students from using generative AI while others have introduced academic policies encouraging student interaction with it, contingent on appropriate disclosure. As technological refinement continues to evolve, the discourse regarding ethical and pedagogical applications remains an active area of exploration with many unresolved issues and concerns under continuous scrutiny.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nGenerative AI has significant potential to transform the educational landscape by enhancing the effectiveness, engagement, and accessibility of learning for all students. Its capabilities can pave the way for more dynamic, personalized, and interactive educational experiences.9,70 Among its myriad applications, generative AI can provide easy access to information, serve as a virtual interactive tutor, offer personalized feedback, generate case scenarios, offer research assistance, and assist in academic writing. Table 3 presents the opportunities of generative AI in the educational sector.\\n\\nGenerative AI also provides opportunities for educators to improve students’ learning. To illustrate, the implementation of generative AI in education exhibits considerable potential to significantly attenuate the occupational demands faced by educators.78 Such technology can be harnessed to provide assessments on the students’ work (e.g., tasks, dissertations, and projects) and devise a grading matrix for evaluation. Educators may employ generative AI to construct diverse examination structures, ranging from open-ended questions to multiple-choice assessments. This can help them complete tasks in a short amount of time. Generative AI can also alleviate educators’ workload by assisting educators in identifying and creating relevant teaching materials such as lecture notes and slides. It can also assist them in generating lesson plans for teaching with a set of parameters and constraints. This can be a starting point for novice teachers with relatively nascent pedagogical experience as a preliminary groundwork for their teaching methodologies.78 Additionally, generative AI tools can also serve as teaching assistants. Their ability to produce translations, elucidations, and summaries may be harnessed to simplify intricate learning materials and facilitate student comprehension.71\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\nNumerous global educational bodies have banned the use of generative AI tools in schools and colleges. There is a growing concern among educators about generative AI’s potential impact, notably in terms of assessments, with issues such as originality and plagiarism at the forefront. Similar apprehensions are also present in the realm of academic publishing. Generative AI tools makes it difficult for educators, particularly those at research-oriented institutions, to confirm the novelty of the work that students submit. For example, if the output of generative AI tools goes unnoticed by standard plagiarism detection systems used universities,79 how can it be confirmed a particular paper or essay represents the student’s original work rather than just the product of generative AI?\\n\\nOne of the significant challenges includes potential bias in data and algorithms, which could inadvertently shape learning outcomes and perceptions. Moreover, a lack of transparency surrounding AI-driven processes might create a barrier to trust and acceptance among users.80 The use of generative AI in education also raises ethical and safety issues as it can infringe upon the privacy of students. If the tool isn’t adequately protected, it could be leveraged to gather confidential information.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='68256768-8315-4ae6-a215-a0401c78d4e6', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\n# Table 3. Generative AI opportunities in education.\\n\\n|Theme|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Personalized feedback|Generative AI can oﬀer individualized feedback on assignments, pinpointing strengths and suggesting areas of improvement. This approach promotes targeted growth and motivation as well as enhances the learning experience. Customized educational strategies and pedagogical resources may be systematically developed by considering students’ diverse learning modalities and capacities.|\\n|Virtual interactive tutor|Generative AI can be used to create virtual tutors that can answer students’ queries and provide them with appropriate feedback. This helps provide real-time explanations and responses to student queries as well as facilitate continuous learning support beyond traditional classroom hours. Virtual tutors can also help in language learning. For instance, a virtual tutor can deliver tailored responses and facilitate dialogic exercises for individuals acquiring a new language. An exceptionally individualized learning environment can be provided as such a tutor can dynamically adjust to the learner’s proﬁciency and speed of learning. This approach is advantageous for learners with limited access to human language tutors or those who favor self-paced learning by accommodating to their personalized timetables.|\\n|Easy access to information|Generative AI can facilitate student access to information across diverse platforms (e.g., websites, mobile applications) and within various domains. Compared to conventional search engine tools, generative AI exhibits enhanced eﬃciency as it does not merely proﬀer a sequence of sources but comprehensively articulated responses. Pedagogically, this implies that generative AI can curtail the temporal investment required for information retrieval which would allow students additional time for reading and engaging in critical introspection of the presented document.|\\n|Generating case scenarios|Generative AI can create a myriad of illustrative case studies and scenarios which would facilitate student engagement and cognitive progression. This approach holds promise in its ability to nurture critical thinking capacities among students. Moreover, it could help students transition their theoretical knowledge into practical application by eﬀectively equipping them with the competencies to address real-world challenges.|\\n|Research assistance|Generative AI can potentially be deployed as an assistance tool in academic pursuits by facilitating responses to queries and producing summaries of extensive texts. Moreover, it can be instrumental in creating bibliographies, delineating outlines, and providing supplementary research aids. The conveniences in the research process can be signiﬁcantly augmented by the capabilities of generative AI in structuring outlines, aiding in literature surveys, and analyzing data. In addition, it can condense pertinent scholarly articles and pinpoint crucial results which will enhance the eﬃciency of researchers in sifting through the abundant amount of data accessible in the digital realm.|\\n|Academic writing|Generative AI can enhance students’ essay writing by oﬀering topic suggestions, proposing structural frameworks, contributing intellectual stimuli, and augmenting their scholarly written discourse. For instance, when a student requires assistance in composing an essay entitled “The Role of Robotics in Education”, these tools can render propositions for declarative statements and prospective subjects for the main body sections. This assistance empowers students to amalgamate their cognitions and perspectives to culminate in a comprehensive piece of writing. Nevertheless, students’ ability to engage in critical reasoning remains paramount in verifying the accuracy and correctness of the composed narrative.|\\n\\nThe transactional distance is another dimension that comes into play with the advent of generative AI in education, particularly in terms of distance education and online learning. This term refers to the psychological and communicative distance between learners and educators which can hinder effective learning. While generative AI has the potential to diminish this transactional distance by offering personalized learning experiences, the educators’ role remains paramount. This is because they are tasked with bridging this gap, providing personalized support, and guidance throughout the learning process. This role is not limited to pedagogical aspects as it also extends to encompass the pedagogy of care and human-centered learning design.\\n\\nGenerative AI tools might offer constrained information. ChatGPT, for instance, is only equipped with data up to 2021. This constraint can lead to knowledge deficiencies and outdated information if the tool misreads command. These limitations would contribute to incorrect or inaccurate responses as knowledge continues to progress. For instance, if asked to incorporate recent references, the tool might invent seemingly valid ones that don’t refer to actual sources. The effectiveness of generative AI is also contingent on data quality. If the training data is of poor quality, the tool’s responses might be imprecise and untrustworthy. Furthermore, generative AI may not deeply comprehend the meanings of the words it handles. It identifies patterns and crafts plausible replies but might not fully understand the underlying notions of the words. This could lead to responses that occasionally lack depth and discernment and possibly deviate from the topic, especially when tasked with activities demanding a subtle grasp of specific domain knowledge.\\n\\n# Research agenda\\n\\nThe following RQs provide a road map for future research on generative AI in education:\\n\\n- How do generative AI tools promote educational sustainability?\\n- What are the optimal ways to promote Industry 5.0 (involving humans and generative education?\\n- What are the drivers and barriers to adopting generative AI tools in education?\\n- How can generative AI tools be used to support students with disabilities?\\n- How can educators ensure the originality of students’ work in the era of generative AI?', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='4ee738d6-e33d-4b4e-a032-e171b1c77663', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative AI in Banking\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThe advancement of AI has resulted in generative AI, which involves using algorithms and models to create new, original content such as text, images, and videos. Unlike AI-based Chatbot that relies on preexisting data to make predictions or answer the user’s request, generative AI can create new data on its own, based on the patterns and structures it has learned from the training data. Generative AI has become increasingly popular due to its ability to create and generate new insights, data, and content. It was reported that ChatGPT exceeded 1 million users five days after its launch.\\n\\nWhile it can be said that the most prominent examples of generative AI are ChatGPT and DALL-E, it is imperative to recognize the swift evolution of these generative AI and the emerging innovations are backed by well-funded companies such as Google and Microsoft. OpenAI developed ChatGPT, Microsoft developed the Microsoft 365 Copilot, whereas Google developed Bard. Beyond text, generative AI like MusicLM can generate music and Midjourney can generate images. Ultimately, generative AI learns the underlying patterns from the training data to make it useful for various applications such as content creation, synthesis of images and videos, as well as natural language processing across different industries.\\n\\nWith the enormous amount of data available to banks and financial services providers, this commentary recognizes the prospects for generative AI to enhance financial services provision by autonomously learning from financial data. Banks are crucial service providers that interact with consumers, businesses, and organizations. They possess vast amounts of data that can be utilized for AI and ML applications like generative AI. With the growing prospects of generative AI and the banks’ access to large data sets, there are opportunities for banks to start exploring how to integrate generative AI into their business operations.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\n# Creating a Generative AI Model for Banking\\n\\nThe abundant data available to banks presents possibilities for creating models to respond to customers’ inquiries and train staff on financial services and products. While ChatGPT is a general-purpose LLM based on big data which is available over the internet, banks are expected to create generative AI models that can offer specific insight for financial services. This would be building on the works done by Bloomberg which has introduced its own generative AI called BloombergGPT that has been trained on a variety of financial data, including Bloomberg’s financial data archives and public sources. Bloomberg set out to build a model that achieves best-in-class results on financial benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general-purpose LLM benchmarks. BloombergGPT is an indicator of what is to come in fintech whereby financial firms use their data to create ChatGPT-like models. While BloombergGPT represents the first step in developing and applying this technology in the financial industry, no public-facing chatbot interface exists. Instead, BloombergGPT is being integrated into Bloomberg Terminal.\\n\\nThere are enormous opportunities for banks, especially for commercial and retail banks, to consider developing domain-focused generative AI tools to enhance their business operations. They have the data and can start training models with these data to develop and provide a platform for consumer engagement.\\n\\n# Customer Engagement\\n\\nAligning with the idea of creating a domain-focused generative AI model, consumers can also use this platform to engage with banks to ask a question that applies to their needs. For example, consumers can ask for advice based on their individual characteristics.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='b66f0876-6e0a-46ac-81f0-d65076ceb3e0', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\n# Staff\\n\\n- Contact center agents\\n- Financial advisers\\n- Marketers\\n- Developers\\n\\n# Established Banks\\n\\n- Customer data\\n- Public data\\n- Generative AI\\n- Retail\\n- Accuracy of information\\n- Trust in information\\n- Whose responsibility\\n\\n# FinTech\\n\\n- Consumers\\n- Regulators\\n\\n# Figure 3. Conceptual framework for generative AI in banking.\\n\\nPrompts such as “I am employed full time, I have three children, I have a mortgage, and I have a personal debt of £25,000, what financial advice can you offer me?” The bank’s generative AI should be able to offer some financial advice and recommendation based on the large data set used to train the model. This generative AI builds on existing technology infrastructure for chatbots that can assist customers with their banking needs. These chatbots can understand natural language and provide personalized responses to customer queries. Generative AI can also be used to develop investment strategies that can optimize portfolio returns based on various factors, such as risk tolerance, market conditions, and asset allocation.\\n\\n# Fraud detection\\n\\nFrom a banking perspective, generative AI models have access to a large amount of data (e.g., legal, fraud, and compliance documents) which would assist in understanding patterns of fraud and other financial crimes. Generative AI can be used to detect fraudulent transactions in banking services. These models can identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data in real-time and proactively flag potential fraudulent transactions.\\n\\n# Marketing communication\\n\\nBanks can use generative AI to develop marketing communication campaigns that appeal to their target audience. As Mogaji et al. proposed, the possibilities of using AI to personalize emotionally appealing advertisements and the creative ability of generative AI to use images, text, and music could assist banks with the generation of personalized advertisements for their customers. Instead of having a generic marketing communication, banks can use generative AI to develop messages that align with the particular interest of their consumers. This would serve as opportunities for personalized messages based on the available data for the market segment. This personalized approach may include sending personalized birthday, religious, or cultural event greetings to their customers with unique images, text, and music based on their interests.\\n\\n# Streamlining business operations\\n\\nBanks can use generative AI to streamline their business operations, from mundane back-end activities to', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='91a7138b-428a-4278-80b5-410208704550', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 16 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\\n\\nconsumer-facing inquiries and interactions. As shown in Figure 3, contact center agents, advisors, and developers can engage with generative AI tools to take proactive steps to suggest personalized actions such as introducing a new savings account or proposing specific products to a customer. For example, A financial adviser can input customers’ transactions into a generative AI model to understand the consumers’ spending habits and offer a personalized service. Banks can use the generative AI model to create customer segments, understand their common interests and pain points, as well as determine the best way to engage with them. In addition, generative AI models can be used for training staff, streamlining repetitive and time-consuming tasks, serving as a virtual assistant to respond to customers’ increasingly complex inquiries as well as releasing staff from routine tasks to concentrate more on innovative and strategic responsibilities which would lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and accuracy.89\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\n# The infrastructure\\n\\nIt is imperative to recognize that financial services are significantly regulated.90,91 The use of technology, access to data, and provision of financial services may serve as challenges. Even if regulatory demands are met, having the infrastructure to make generative AI or any form of digital technology in banking services work can also be challenging.91,92 While recognizing the efforts by Bloomberg, it is imperative to recognize that it was a domain-specific generative AI developed by a single company using their proprietary data. The challenge lies in exploring a working relationship between various banks for the possibility of sharing and combining data to develop a banking generative AI model. This collaboration will, however, present significant implications surrounding competition, data privacy, and ethics.81,82\\n\\n# Access to data\\n\\nWhile data is essential for training these generative AI models, access to quality data is critical and can also present a significant challenge. While the established, traditional, and old brands may have access to extensive proprietary data by virtue of their long years of operations and customer base, there are significant challenges for newer banks and fintech companies. While established banks like HSBC, Barclays, and Lloyds in the United Kingdom may use data they already have to develop their generative AI model, app-only banks like Starling and Monzo may have significant challenges in accessing huge quantities of data for their models. As such, they would have to depend on publicly available financial data which might not offer detailed information for consumers who wants to use the model. On the other hand, the provision of data for generative AI also presents a significant challenge, especially as Wall Street banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo are cracking down on AI-powered chatbot,93 there are concerns surrounding the effective and safe ways of using these technologies.\\n\\n# Accuracy of the results\\n\\nAs it is well known with generative AI tools, the generated insights may sometimes be wrong.9 They might produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts. This limitation has enormous implications for financial services providers, especially in cases where trust is very important. This inaccurate output will also have significant implications for consumers, staff, and other stakeholders who may rely on such output. As with the example of the customer using the generative AI model to look for financial advice, the assurance that the right financial advice has been provided is in question. Moreover, who takes the responsibility for providing those inaccurate and misleading advice? The bank that provided the AI model or the customer who did not use the correct prompt. As stated by Mogaji et al.,84 the implications of AI on the digital marketing of financial services to vulnerable customers, generative AI may not be suitable for offering financial decisions on loans and other forms of borrowings as it would be biased if they are trained on biased data.\\n\\n# Recommendations\\n\\n# The regulatory requirements\\n\\nBanks would need to reflect on the regulatory nature of their service provision and its impact on technology. As banks have been regulated with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and AI,91 it is imperative to recognize that generative AI will find its way into financial services providers. Regulators must be more responsive and proactive in providing advice and guidance on integrating generative AI into their business operations.89 Regulators and banks need to start discussing if and how they can work together to provide a regulatory framework for developing and using generative AI.\\n\\n# Collaboration\\n\\nBanks must reflect on their collaborative network to build these generative AI models. When working with', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='fc939d6b-7d6a-4487-9901-b4fe726b5617', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\n# Policymakers’ responsibilities\\n\\nIt is expected that the generative AI model will disrupt financial services. Thus, it is imperative to understand policymakers’ responsibility and preparedness for this disruption. As Huang reflected on the UK’s regulatory guidance on crypto-assets, research needs to evaluate the attitude of policymakers and what they are doing to help manage the impending technology transformation. Future research must understand if policymakers are trying to stop it or provide the relevant infrastructure needed to support it. Specifically, Mogaji and Nguyen examined managers’ comprehension on digital transformation of financial services in several countries. They found that policymaking in developing countries is lagging, indicating a need for further research to identify the differences in approaches between developing and developed nations.\\n\\n# The use of generative AI\\n\\nBanks must reflect on who will use the generative AI if and when it is developed. Would this generative AI be available to consumers seeking financial advice or bank managers for training and streamlining business operations? As with BloombergGPT which does not have a public-facing chatbot interface, banks will need to determine if they want to make generative AI available for consumers. This model can also be made available to third-party organizations including credit agencies and personal finance management apps. While it has advantages in enhancing financial services provision, there are significant implications on ethics, access to data, and trust in the advice offered.\\n\\n# Generative AI in retailing\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThe many waves of digitalization have constantly resulted in disruptions in the retail industry. In the past, retail activities (e.g., inventory management, sales) had to be done physically and manually. Since then, innovations such as the cash register and barcode have automated some aspects of retailing. More recently, the Internet has allowed companies to carry out their retail activities digitally via electronic retailing (e-tailing). With that said, e-tailing has been incorporated into the operations of many retailers ranging from small, local ones to multinational giants. This is predominantly due to the relatively low barriers to entry into e-tailing and increased digitalization among the general public.\\n\\n# Research agenda\\n\\n# Consumer awareness and attitude\\n\\nFuture research should investigate consumers’ awareness and attitudes toward generative AI by financial services providers. It is imperative to engage with consumers to evaluate if they would be willing to use it for financial advice, trust the output of generative AI, and envisage its use in banking services. Therefore, this research strand will extend the existing research on generative AI for banking services.\\n\\n# Managers’ awareness and attitude\\n\\nAs Mogaji and Nguyen evaluated managers’ understanding of AI concerning marketing financial services, future research will be required to understand bank employees’ willingness and attitudes toward generative AI. This research strand would need to include contact center agents, advisors, and marketing executives to evaluate their understanding of generative AI, level of technical capabilities to use these models, and impact on their job. As generative AI is posited to disrupt financial services workforces, future research needs to evaluate bank managers’ attitudes and preparedness for the disruption presented by generative AI.\\n\\nIn view of this, many retailers around the world have started integrating generative AI into their operations. For example, the grocery delivery company Instacart.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='ccd15129-3141-4bf2-b9ba-f09be948072e', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# 18 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\\n\\nuses generative AI to answer questions from its custo- media sentiment. Based on this, detailed customer profiles with personalized recommendations and retail experiences can be generated. Expedia is a company that has integrated generative AI into its mobile application to provide users with personalized travel recommendations and planning assistance. Furthermore, companies can also employ generative AI to encourage customer co-creation. For instance, Coca-Cola encouraged people to create art through its new generative AI platform for a chance to be featured on its digital billboards. These would help retailers in enhancing their marketing strategies by understanding the customers’ preferred types of advertising; thereby increasing their competitive advantage and customer satisfaction.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nThere are endless opportunities that can be gained from integrating and deriving value from generative AI in the retail setting. This is because there is still much untapped potential as retailers are only in the early stages of incorporating generative AI with their operations. More recently, Google and Microsoft have made their generative AI available via an application programming interface. One key implication is that it enables retailers to integrate these tools into their systems. With that said, generative AI can offer benefits to retailers with regard to their front-end and back-end operations. More specifically, front-end operations refer to the retail activities that directly impact customers which include marketing and customer service. In contrast, back-end operations denote the functions that support retail activities that happen behind the scenes such as merchandising and data management.\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\nThere are challenges that retailers need to overcome for the successful integration of generative AI into their operations. This section specifically highlights three major challenges which can be collectively referred to as the 3Ds.\\n\\nThe first challenge is related to data. It is undeniable that data plays a significant role in the utilization of generative AI to supplement various retail activities. While there is a lot more data available than ever before, it is fragmented across different platforms and sources. Besides, not all data is relevant in the decision-making of different retail activities. On the other hand, the lack of data is a problem that is pertinent among smaller retailers. This is because smaller retailers are unable to generate large volumes of data given the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='da2506ee-a018-4b42-9224-e578cdc73dd5', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\nscale of their operations. This will put them at a major disadvantage as data is essential in refining the results of generative AI. Moreover, privacy is another significant concern as the input data and resulting insights are stored in the generative AI’s servers. Following this, Samsung has banned its employees from utilizing generative AI on company-owned devices and networks.\\n\\nIn the retail setting, data tends to include customer information that is sensitive (e.g., bank account number) and identifiable (e.g., name). This would entail a certain level of risk to retailers as there is the potential for confidential details to be leaked or disclosed to others. Thus, retailers will not only need to have a sufficient amount of data but also carefully curate and protect the data that is used for generative AI.\\n\\n# Retailers’ perspective\\n\\nThe integration of generative AI into their operations would be a huge undertaking for many retailers. This is because it is a relatively novel innovation with various applications in the retail setting. It would thus require retailers to reconsider some of their strategic decisions. With that said, a retail company’s internal environment is comprised of multiple stakeholders. Thus, there would be differing perceptions, hesitancy, and readiness toward integrating generative AI into the current business operations. In view of this, the research questions that can be addressed by future research include:\\n\\n- What critical success factors will retailers need to address before, during, and after integrating generative AI with their operations?\\n- To what extent should retailers integrate generative AI into the various retail operations?\\n- How should retailers handle (e.g., access, curate, protect) data that is being utilized for generative AI?\\n- How can retailers leverage generative AI to enhance their customer relationships (e.g., acquisition, retention) and interactions?\\n\\n# Customers’ perspective\\n\\nThe customer is undeniably the most crucial stakeholder that retailers have to consider when integrating generative AI into their operations. This is because they play an important role in determining its sustainability and success. However, the current literature surrounding the different responses that customers would develop toward the application of generative AI in the retail sector still needs to be extended. Following that, future studies can employ a multi-dimensional approach to look into retail customers’ behavior toward generative AI with a focus on the following research questions:\\n\\n- How will customers’ resistance/acceptance of generative AI for retail purposes vary in different contexts (e.g., product category, geographic location)?\\n- How will generative AI affect customers’ perceptions, decision-making, motivations, and behaviors when conducting retail activities?\\n- How will the customers’ experiences with retailing change following the application of generative AI?', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='3e904408-d5f7-4985-a83c-d307380c7bc3', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative AI in the Workplace\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nSince the release of several generative AI platforms in recent years such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bard, and Midjourney, there has been a growing interest in how these advances can change the workplace. The impact of such generative AI platforms is not limited to text generation but also extends to image generation and code creation. Following this, the proposed impact of generative AI is not restricted to one sector of the economy and has important ramifications for a plethora of roles and job profiles. A recent survey conducted by Mercer indicated that 57% of CEOs and CFOs plan to increase the use of AI for automating tasks whereas roughly a third of respondents are planning to redesign work processes to reduce their dependency on people. Simultaneously, there is also a growing use of generative AI platforms by professionals to augment and complement their work. While AI has been traditionally seen as a tool to reduce repetitive and rule-based work, generative AI platforms are prompting significant changes in less structured and creative tasks. As such, work in professions such as those in programming, architectural, writing, and customer service will be significantly impacted.\\n\\nGenerative AI is posited to influence a range of different tasks in the workplace, from automating manual and highly structured tasks to augmenting decision-making in complex and unstructured activities. By introducing generative AI to replace or augment such tasks, it is anticipated that there will be several significant shifts on the organizational level as well as the ways individuals, teams, and business units work and function. In exploring the impact of generative AI, existing research has focused on the changing role of the individual within the workplace. Its effects on individual employees within the workplace are likely the most immediate. On this level, there have been a multitude of studies concerning the potential effects that generative AI will have in displacing jobs and leading to the emergence of novel forms of work. Research in this area has not only focused on the effect on employment but also on perceptions and attitudes of individuals whose work is likely to be affected. Nevertheless, generative AI is now moving from the realm of science fiction to reality with much of the debate that has been largely speculative has now turned.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nThe introduction of generative AI in the workplace can create a plethora of opportunities for professionals. Following the discussion of several past studies, generative AI has the potential to automate manual processes and free up employees from highly structured tasks. The affordances offered by generative AI platforms allow for the handling of data in a more detailed manner and facilitate interactions with the end users that are more “human-like.” Nevertheless, the true power of generative AI lies in its ability to enhance and support creative tasks. A major opportunity within the workplace is utilizing different types of generative AI to augment creative tasks. One example is the case of using visual-based generative AI platforms for enhancing tasks related to design. A challenge designers face when developing proposals for customers is that it is often difficult to translate the requirements into a satisfactory outcome and rendering different conceptual sketches is very time-consuming. Many generative AI tools for interior design, floor-planning, rendering of architectural plans, and landscape design have become increasingly available with outputs that are impressive. These tools are thus facilitating completely new opportunities for professionals in this industry and changing how work is done in a fundamental manner.\\n\\nSuch disruptions in the workplace are not only apparent in the design industry but also to other professions in which the tasks were once thought to only be possible to be undertaken by humans. For instance, developing programming scripts, analyzing data, or composing music are now just some of the activities that generative AI can perform. This can lead to greater access to information and a servitization or even democratization of higher-order skills. Hence, it will no longer be necessary for individuals to spend several years learning how to program in order to develop customized software or understand the basics of music and composition in order to creatively express their musical inclinations. An emerging opportunity in this regard is that many of the skills that consider bound to humans can be commodified and available through simple interfaces. This would have important influences on how individuals will work and collaborate in the workplace. By reducing the time and effort it takes to develop code or render an architectural sketch, it is likely to increase the quality and...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='8fb4d54b-8a15-403d-ab9b-825ee9b4ddd4', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\ncreativity of work that is produced in different sectors. For example, generative AI can help improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall costs for them by offering personalized treatment plans and diagnoses. 130 This can be achieved by analyzing the patients’ medical results and identifying potential health issues that may be inadvertently missed by clinicians. Similarly, generative AI can be used to personalize customer shopping experiences by recommending products based on their past preferences and behavior. 131 Furthermore, generative AI can help financial institutions detect fraudulent transactions and reduce the risk of financial crime. 132 Additionally, these affordances enabled by generative AI allow individuals to have greater access to information. Within the workplace, intelligent automation and augmentation of work are likely to facilitate more interactions among employees who would previously need to dedicate a large portion of their time to tasks that required direct interaction with technologies. Therefore, an opportunity for generative AI in the workplace is that it can minimize the time individuals spend engaging with their technologies to complete respective tasks and instead utilize the time to collaborate with their colleagues, customers, and business partners.\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\nWhile there are ample opportunities in the workplace to adopt generative AI, there are also many challenges and potential risks. One key issue is that while the technology that generative AI is built on appears to have reached an impressive level, there is still a lack of understanding as to how such technologies can be integrated into the workplace in a way that generates value. 133 Companies appear to have a limited understanding of how to systematize the deployment of generative AI with most workplace applications appearing to be motivated by the individual employees. 134 This tendency can create imbalances between different groups of employees; those that are familiar with generative AI and see the value in utilizing it for their work-related tasks and those that have little knowledge or are apprehensive about using such technologies. Such division of employees may give rise to tensions and cause friction in workplace relations.\\n\\nFurthermore, as large parts of the creative process may be assigned to generative AI, changes will likely be observed in the moral and psychological well-being of employees. Apart from the obvious issue of job displacement, the loss of purpose in one’s work and the transfer of the creative process to a “black box” may lead to severe consequences in the drive of many creative professionals. Given the lack of understanding on how organizations should approach the diffusion of such technologies in the workplace, it may result in a loss of productivity. In addition, a potential issue that might arise from using third-party generative AI tools concerns the intellectual ownership of outputs. 135 Organizations may find themselves in a minefield, whereby they are automatically at a disadvantage compared to their rivals if they do not utilize such platforms. However, if they do, they are not the owners of important intellectual property. Bridging these issues on the individual, team, and organizational levels are posited to be major challenges in the years to follow.\\n\\n# Research agenda\\n\\nWhile the proliferation of generative AI will lead to substantial opportunities in the workplace, it also comes with a variety of challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome. Undoubtedly, this phenomenon opens up many interesting questions that researchers can look to answer. An exhaustive list of such topics would not be possible given that very little is known about how generative AI will change the workplace. However, several major themes that will likely dominate research in the next years are presented below:\\n\\n# Governing generative AI\\n\\nThe concept of governance can be interpreted in many ways depending on the authority that exercises it. However, it can be argued that an important context in which there will be a need to define some rules, processes, and structures is that of the workplace. More specifically, when it comes to using generative AI for creative tasks, it is important for information systems and HRM research to go beyond the scope of conceptualizing technology governance as a set of practices to optimize the use of technology toward organizational goals, but also to encompass how technology utilization influences the well-being of employees within the workplace. 136 Hence, there is a need to understand how the use of generative AI in organizational settings influences both the cognitive and psychological states of employees, as well as how it defines their interactions and modes of collaboration. Delving into this topic is likely going to be very challenging as it will require an understanding of the employees’ emotional and cognitive states over time while integrating aspects of team performance and collaboration. Before, technology has been primarily examined as the platform to which collaboration', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='f736c89d-5f17-4cc3-9f76-56bd05c75d8a', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative AI in manufacturing\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThe fourth industrial revolution envisions the adoption of digitalization, automation, and connectivity technologies in the manufacturing industry that will empower manufacturers to improve their production processes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. Generative AI is an example of such technology that has created a lot of excitement in the manufacturing industry. While the principles are not entirely new, its ability to produce human readable output based on text input offers enormous potential for manufacturers. As a whole, generative AI can be utilized to explore and execute optimal solutions, create novel outputs according to functional specifications, costs, and achieve efficient lead time through the combinations of design and production options.\\n\\n# Algorithmic creative control\\n\\nAnother key issue that is likely to concern future research is the role of generative AI as the dominant creative force in several industries. While the outputs from such platforms may be seen as a means of enhancing productivity and creativity for many professions, the flip side is that maybe they will gradually replace or take over control of the creative processes. The draw toward AI-generated outcomes may render human creativity irrelevant in the workplace. With that said, very little is known about the long-term effects of moving in this direction as well as how individuals in the creative professions may feel about the creative element of their work being dictated by opaque algorithms. In this regard, it is important to understand how the deployment of generative AI would be done so that employees do not feel controlled in their creative tasks. Moreover, it is important to understand optimal ways of working with generative AI so that an effective augmentation of the creative processes can take place.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\nA common issue in the manufacturing industry is the shortage of talents with highly technical, manual, and operational skills, knowledge, and expertise. Some of the attributable reasons for the skills gap include an aging and reduced workforce as well as changing skill sets due to new technology. According to Deloitte, the coming years will see a need for the “ability to program machines on the plant floor.” Although daunting, generative AI offers a promise to bridge this gap through careful investments and a new generation of workforce building. For example, generative AI can be used to train workers on new skills and technologies by offering personalized learning for a more effective learning experience.\\n\\n# Collaboration in the age of generative AI\\n\\nOne of the fundamental changes of generative AI concerns the changes in the creative process. Typically, high-skilled professionals in creative industries have certain modes of operating and collaborating in which digital tools are utilized to complement this process. The generative AI platforms that have been seen to date mostly rely on individual input and interaction in creating outcomes. Thus, the question that arises is in which way will future generative AI platforms be designed to cater to the needs of specific professionals. While there is an increasing number of generative AI tools emerging with specialized use for more niche groups, the emphasis to date has been on optimizing the end result and not accommodating the means of collaboration. As such, it will be interesting to investigate how the design of the interfaces for generative AI can accommodate or redefine certain ways of collaboration among professionals. As of now, very little is known as to how collaborative work should define requirements for generative AI tools. However, it is likely that generative AI and its affordances will radically reshape the ways in which professionals work together.\\n\\nGenerative AI can help manufacturers “look ahead” and anticipate disruptions through simulations and predictions of impacts. Generative AI can be employed to perform an analysis of various data sources for real-time defects identification which would reduce the reliance.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='971bcf7f-814c-4c79-9b80-ab1938cf1adb', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\nCompanies need to ensure they have the necessary computing infrastructure and data storage to support generative AI and ensure interoperability.140 Manufacturing sites often employ a variety of machines, tools, and production systems that may not be compatible. As such, plant engineers are often relied upon to determine how the different technologies best work together. The lack of a common framework means that integrating generative AI with current production systems may require significant upfront investment in terms of technical capability.\\n\\n# Research agenda\\n\\nWe call for the development of case studies and empirical studies on the adoption of generative AI in the manufacturing industry. Manufacturers seeking to integrate generative AI would need to understand the types of tasks that can be credibly employed and what are the best practices in order to fully realize the benefits of generative AI. The potential impacts of generative AI on job displacements, security, privacy, and biases as well as environmental impacts require further attention. Thus, research on how to incorporate generative AI in the workplace, training, and reskilling employees for acceptance will be helpful in preparing the workforce. Finally, the ethical use of generative AI raises concerns surrounding privacy, security, accountability, and fairness. Therefore, guiding frameworks and policies are needed to inform and govern its use.\\n\\n# Generative AI in sustainable IT management\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThe Information Technology (IT) industry has a big role to play in reducing the impact of the climate crisis that the world is currently experiencing. A major fraction of greenhouse gas emissions is caused by the IT industry which plays a vital role in the corporate world. However, improvements in AI present exciting opportunities to enhance sustainability in the IT industry.

OOI ET AL.\\n\\ndesign and development, this section expounds on how generative AI can support sustainability management in the IT industry. By enabling more efficient and effective resource usage, lowering waste, as well as enhancing environmental performance, generative AI has the potential to significantly improve IT sustainability management. Generative AI has enormous potential as it can create original responses which are applicable to decision-making, design, optimization, and simulation. For instance, when it comes to designing, generative AI can help in producing optimum structures or layouts based on predetermined criteria. By investigating several options, it can produce answers for challenging problems in optimization. For testing and analysis, generative AI may build virtual worlds and scenarios in simulation. It can assist in creating alternative scenarios and assessing probable outcomes during decision-making. IT has the potential to become substantially more sustainable thanks to generative AI. There are two ways in which generative AI and sustainability are related. On the one hand, generative AI can help promote sustainable development. For example, raising public awareness of climate change and others by minimizing its negative effects. “AI for sustainability” is defined in this fashion. On the other hand, managing IT resources in a way that balances environmental, social, and economic factors is referred to as sustainable IT. Companies can obtain a variety of advantages from the application of generative AI in sustainable IT such as improving resource efficiency and reducing environmental impacts of IT operations.\\n\\n# Opportunities\\n\\n# Generative AI and energy savings for the IT sector\\n\\nThe energy usage of data centers, which serves as a crucial part of the IT industry, significantly contributes to greenhouse emissions. However, by forecasting demand and modifying power management accordingly, AI can assist in maximizing energy use in data centers. In order to promote real-time electricity trade, generative AI can be employed to predict the evolution of energy prices based on forecasts of supply and demand. Additionally, studies show that robots and AI technologies can be used more frequently to monitor and maintain energy plants. Machine learning algorithms, for instance, may monitor server usage data and modify power consumption in real time, eliminating energy waste and yielding considerable energy savings. One illustration of this is the employment of Google’s DeepMind AI to cut the energy usage of Google’s data centers by 40%. DeepMind examined server usage data and forecasted demand, enabling it to modify power management and lower energy waste. Google was able to drastically cut its energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions which highlighted the potential of AI to increase energy efficiency in the IT industry. Another illustration is Microsoft’s AI for Earth initiative, which uses AI to address environmental issues such as lowering data centers’ carbon footprints. Microsoft uses AI to streamline the operations of its data centers, which has led to significant energy savings and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Data centers may reduce their environmental impact and support IT industry sustainability by employing AI to optimize energy use.\\n\\n# Generative AI and IT resource administration for sustainability\\n\\nDistributed IT solutions, including cloud and edge computing, use a lot of computational power and bandwidth. However, generative AI can improve how these resources are distributed which will lead to effective usage and minimal waste. By dynamically allocating resources according to demand, for example, generative AI can make better use of resources that would lessen the environmental impacts of IT systems. This was done, for instance, by using IBM’s Watson AI to improve resource distribution in cloud computing. It allowed for more effective distribution of resources and cutting down on waste thanks to the data analysis on resource utilization and forecasting of future demand. As a result, IBM was able to lessen its impact on the environment and support sustainability in the IT industry.\\n\\n# Generative AI for sustainability in purchasing\\n\\nAnother area where generative AI may help with sustainability management in the IT industry is sustainable buying. Organizations may make better-educated decisions regarding sustainable procurement from generative AI’s ability to assess and compare the product’s environmental footprint which includes carbon emissions, energy use, and material usage. As a result, the environmental impact of IT goods and services may be lessened. The Ecochain AI platform, which is used to evaluate the environmental impact of goods and services, is one example of this. Data about a product’s environmental impact, which includes carbon emissions, energy use, and material usage, is gathered and analyzed using AI. Using this information, recommendations are then made for more environmentally friendly purchasing choices.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='86cc7e19-95b5-456e-9111-7c95272f01ab', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Generative AI in sustainable development and design\\n\\nAnother area where generative AI may help with sustainability management in the IT industry is sustainable design and development. By accessing data on the environmental impacts of various design decisions and making recommendations for eco-friendly hardware and software solutions, AI may support the design and development of sustainable IT systems. This may lead to the development of more sustainable IT goods and services. A program like Intel’s AI for Social Good, which uses AI to tackle social and environmental issues such as sustainability in the IT industry, is an illustration of this. Intel is analyzing data on the environmental impact of various designs using AI.\\n\\n# Data center administration\\n\\nSince data centers consume a lot of energy, managing them efficiently is crucial for minimizing the environmental impact of IT operations. Automating data center administration and resource optimization are two ways generative AI might be useful. Much of the energy consumption is attributed to data centers that store data which is ultimately fed into AI. Data centers currently utilize 2% of the world’s electricity and is expected to use nearly 6% of the world’s energy by 2030. Generative AI, for instance, can examine data on energy consumption patterns, cooling system usage, and server utilization in order to provide real-time insights on data center performance. This data will help the organization use resources more efficiently, less energy, and reduce its carbon footprint.\\n\\n# Manage electronic waste\\n\\nTo lessen the environmental impact of IT operations, it is imperative to manage electronic trash (e-waste) sustainably. Bogue sheds light on the current applications and potential future roles of robots and AI in recycling, a field that historically relied heavily on labor. Generative AI can assist by processing data on the production of e-waste and offering management-related insights. Generative AI, for instance, can examine data on the IT equipment life cycle to find chances for equipment refurbishment, recycling, or disposal. This knowledge can be employed to improve e-waste management, lessen the environmental impact of IT operations, and raise the social responsibility of the company.\\n\\n# Supply chain administration\\n\\nAs it entails controlling the environmental and social effects of IT equipment manufacturing, shipping, and disposal, supply chain management is a crucial component of sustainable IT. Real-time insights into supply chain efficiency and the detection of problems can be provided by AI, which can be helpful. Using data on suppliers’ social and environmental performance, for instance, generative AI can examine supply chain potential. This would enable companies to improve their supply chain management, lessen their environmental impact of IT operations, and increase their social responsibility.\\n\\n# Challenges\\n\\n# Energy consumption\\n\\nGenerative AI tools in particular use a lot of processing power which would then lead to higher energy usage. The IT industry needs to develop energy-efficient algorithms, optimize hardware infrastructure, and use renewable energy sources in efforts to address the environmental effects of generative AI.\\n\\n# Data & model bias\\n\\nFor generative AI tools that have been trained on biased or unreliable data, they may continue to reinforce current social, economic, and environmental injustices. In order for generative AI tools to be effective, the training data must be representative, diverse, and bias-free. It is also crucial to create methods for reducing and detecting bias in the results produced by AI.\\n\\n# E-trash management\\n\\nThe IT industry’s brisk adoption of new innovations such as generative AI necessitates frequent hardware replacements and the disposal of trash (e-waste). In an effort to reduce the negative environmental effects of discarded IT equipment and encourage recycling and ethical disposal techniques, effective e-waste management policies should be put into place.\\n\\n# Ethical aspects\\n\\nThe use of generative AI should adhere to ethical concepts and rules. In general, generative AI should be used responsibly and ethically. To ensure that generative AI is utilized responsibly, does not violate human rights, or causes harm to society, the IT industry must address concerns about privacy, security, transparency, and accountability.\\n\\n# Lifecycle assessment\\n\\nIt is vital to evaluate the environmental impact of generative AI at every stage of their lifecycle from conception and development to operationalization and decommissioning. Comprehensive life cycle assessments can be employed to pinpoint problem areas and facilitate the creation of sustainable generative AI systems.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='9b67b015-cbf7-4d5d-b172-e4f9e342e2b5', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Regulatory frameworks\\n\\nTo control the creation, implementation, and application of generative AI systems, the IT sector needs clear and efficient regulatory frameworks. To guarantee that generative AI make positive contributions to sustainable development, these frameworks should look to address issues such as energy efficiency, data protection, and ethical AI practices.\\n\\n# Workforce development and skill gaps\\n\\nA competent workforce is necessary to successfully integrate generative AI and sustainability management in the IT industry. By providing training programs and educational efforts that give professionals the information and skills that they need to effectively design and maintain sustainable AI solutions, the skill gap can be bridged.\\n\\n# Transparency and explainability\\n\\nGenerative AI models may generate results that are complicated in terms of comprehension or explanation. This would make it difficult to judge the consequences they have on sustainability. Promoting trust, responsibility, and sustainability in the IT industry requires ways to decipher and explain the results produced by generative AI.\\n\\n# Concluding remarks\\n\\nGenerative AI is a technological innovation with endless potential to transform businesses and society. Despite its immense potential, there are still limitations that need to be acknowledged and present across all industries, including but not limited to privacy, ethical dimensions, and issues related to data ownership. It is only by overcoming these limitations will businesses be able to effectively implement generative AI into their operations.

    "\n",
    "1. **Integration of Diverse Knowledge Areas:**\n",
    "   - Each question should incorporate insights from at least two different business domains (e.g., finance, sustainability, technology, operations).\n",
    "   - Blend concepts that may not be directly related to encourage interdisciplinary thinking.\n",

    "2. **Encourage Multi-hop Reasoning:**\n",

    "   - Ensure that answering the questions involves connecting various ideas rather than retrieving single facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Promote Abstract Reasoning:**\n",
    "   - Design questions that go beyond factual inquiries and require strategic thinking and abstract reasoning.\n",
    "   - Focus on overarching themes and big-picture considerations rather than specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintain Brevity and Clarity:**\n",
    "   - Keep each question concise, aiming for a length that is clear and direct without unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "   - Avoid referencing specific reports or documents directly in the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Examples:**\n",

    "2. How can SAP leverage emerging technologies to diversify its product offerings and meet evolving customer needs?\n",
