+# A systematic literature review on corporate sustainability: contributions, barriers, innovations and future possibilities

## Abstract
This paper aims to understand the current research scenario through published studies on corporate sustainability, emphasizing the environmental approach. Methodologically, this research develops a systematic literature review based on papers published in the Web of Science database in the last ten years. As a result, there was an upward evolution of research on the searched topic, with one hundred fifteen publications in the last three years compared to one hundred six documents published in the previous seven years. It is also observed that studies published at the beginning of the time frame between 2011 and 2020 were more concerned with the adoption of corporate sustainability, while the most recent research focuses on new approaches and methodologies for its implementation. And, with regard to its implementation, one of the main barriers is the incorrect perception of senior managers that the results from corporate sustainability must be more linked to the economic than to the environmental and social spheres. As relevant aspects, this study observed that new technologies, currently led by the 5th generation mobile network (5G) and Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), can contribute to the insertion of corporate sustainability in the industrial context. It also noted that, despite being recent, COVID-19 was considered by several researchers as an event to be considered in terms of corporate sustainability.

# 1 Introduction

The term “sustainable” has been used since 1978 by the United Nations as a synonym for ecological development. However, with the popularization of other terms in this context, such as sustainability and sustainable development, there was a large number of definitions proposed for both (Johnston et al., 2007), reaching, for example, the number of 70 only for sustainable development (Lozano, 2008). Discussions continued with the dissemination of the term through the Brundtland Commission Report in 1985 and at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which took place in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In the business context, some variations and definitions were used, among them are the “triple bottom line” (TBL) theory, suggested by Elkington (1998), which consists of the balance in equal harmony between the social, environmental, and economic aspects of the companies.

As noted above, adoption by a culture concerned with the macroenvironment is not new. Corporate Social Responsibility has addressed the issue for more than 50 years (Bowen, 1953). This way of thinking also has several definitions, but there is an understanding regarding the responsibilities that corporations apply in addition to what the legislation requires them to practice (McWilliams et al., 2006a; 2006b). Besides, there are several points in common between Corporate Social Responsibility and corporate sustainability (CS), however CS can be defined as the application of sustainable development at the micro-level, that is, at the corporate level, through a short-term concern related to the economic and environmental aspects and long-term regarding the social performance of the company (Steurer et al., 2005).

Throughout our research, we observed the existence of several literature reviews on corporate sustainability that sought (and were able) to organize the state of the art of the topic, consolidating the individual efforts of several researchers in a single document. However, we also identified some gaps, namely: (i) the methodological characteristics of the publications, broken down into context, application area, and research methods used; (ii) the main research clusters on corporate sustainability, which took into account current aspects, such as COVID-19; (iii) the main contributions of corporate sustainability to organizations, segmented into improving the organization’s performance and reputation, partnerships between the organization and stakeholders, improving the organization’s environmental management and, finally, improving the organization’s human resources; (iv) the main barriers that organizations must overcome in order to adopt corporate sustainability; (v) the main guidelines that organizations must follow to overcome barriers and, thus, be able to implement corporate sustainability; and (vi) the main innovative approaches in corporate sustainability.

In view of so many aspects, the main objective of this research is to identify, analyze and organize information on corporate sustainability that will help us fill the gaps presented. Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the intention is to analyze the evolution of CS within the scholar community in the last ten years, with particular attention on the contributions of the topic to organizations, the limitations and guidelines for the adoption of CS, besides the innovations implemented in the focused period analysis. With the proposed mapping of publications in the last ten years, it will also be possible to observe the main research clusters and recommendations of future research that have been completed, as well as the promising areas within this field of action and study.

The present research is relevant for at least three aspects: (i) corporate sustainability has become a matter of growing international concern (Zhang et al., 2020), being considered.

# A systematic literature review on corporate sustainability

## 2 Review of corporate sustainability

CS can be defined as the adaptation of economic, environmental and social factors to the activities and mechanisms of corporate decision-making, together with principles of corporate governance and risk management applied to these issues (Vardari et al., 2020), seeking sustainable development while minimizing risk and increasing the value of a company, including shareholder value (Lee, 2019). It results from a complementary and connected relationship between the organizational capacities that affect its strategic dimension and the socio-environmental practices that contribute to its operational dimension (Mohammadi et al., 2018).

The application logic emphasizes the thinking of the TBL (Triple Bottom Line), which brings together people, planet and profit, within the scope of its business plan. The objective of CS is that a company can positively and simultaneously impact economic growth, social equity and human development, benefiting in terms of risk management and competitive advantage (Cho et al., 2018). It is an approach that creates long-term value through the integration of financial and non-financial indicators (Rustam et al., 2019).

For its implementation, it is of fundamental importance that organizations incorporate sustainability strategies in their business models, from changes in their governance, in the short term related to the economic and environmental aspects and, in the long term related to the social performance of the company, having focus on results that contribute to a continuous improvement (Ashrafi et al., 2018).

In addition to internal issues, CS is seen as paramount to comply with government regulations in the pursuit of economic benefits and improve the company’s image, thus.

# 2.1 Corporate sustainability approach

Although corporate performance can be evaluated separately, from the social, environmental, economic and responsibility perspectives, it is interesting that Montiel (2008) and Bansal and Song (2017) observed a tendency to converge these elements into an integrated evaluation from the corporate sustainability approach. Also, it is noticed that academic research still diverges from the practice of firms in terms of corporate sustainability (Montiel & Delgado-Ceballos, 2014), possibly because of the complexity that corporate sustainability measurements have gained over time from the scholars’ perspective. This can be evidenced, for example, in Wagner (2010), in which the author shows that innovation does not necessarily relate to corporate sustainability in the presented case study. However, it is important to highlight that as higher requirements are expected from clients and firms that operate at different geographical scales, the academic community is highlighting the need to improve corporate sustainability in theoretical, methodological and operational terms, in order for companies to deliver more integrated results on corporate performance from a sustainable perspective (Baumgartner, 2014; Wagner, 2005), and therefore be aligned with the global 21st-century challenges in terms of corporate performance and sustainability.

Endiana et al. (2020) affirm that the accounting sector of a company can promote environmental conservation through environmental costs, and at the same time, improve performance when implementing a Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS). Mainly, Endiana et al. (2020) evidence that allocating appropriate environmental costs through CSMS can effectively improve the company’s financial performance. Besides, it is believed that a proper application of CSMS, with the disclosure of environmental activities and costs (e.g., of land, materials, energy, etc.), can enhance customer loyalty. From the employees’ perspective, Chang et al. (2020) analyzes the effect of green product psychological ownership on their behavior and performance. Specifically, Chang et al. (2020) evidence that it is important to establish a solid Green Shared Vision to avoid green confusion, related to the environmental characteristics of a company’s products or services, and improve employees’ economic performance. From a methodological concern Kafa et al. (2020) evidences the need for companies to build supply chain management processes that consider the adequate criteria to achieve corporate sustainability.

In a similar approach to Chang et al. (2020), Mazur and Walczynia (2020) indicate that it is relevant that the sustainable management of human resources (SMHR) is adequately implemented when the company has a solid view of its corporate sustainability perspective, with particular attention on meeting the firm’s needs without compromising the ability to meet future stakeholders’ needs. Also, Mazur and Walczynia

# A systematic literature review on corporate sustainability

(2020) indicate that the SMHR should support the company’s sustainable development strategy, promote fair treatment and well-being of employees, support environmentally-friendly practices within the organization, and other functions.

From a broader perspective, Kantabutra and Punnakitikashem (2020) believe that a sum of practices, such as long-term orientation, gradual expansion, risk management, employee priority, innovation within others, leads to an improvement in corporate sustainability performance, because they will impact on the rational use of resources, better working conditions for employees, the longevity of the company and its operations.

Xia et al (2020) highlight practices that can improve the corporate sustainability performance of a company, in terms of socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficiency aspects. Specifically, these practices are related to encouraging environmental innovation, redesigning consumers’ offer, raising support for institutions and policy measures, and organizing synergetic involvement among stakeholders. In this same direction, Crisóstomo et al. (2020) identify determinants for corporate sustainability performance. Within these determinants, there are: ownership concentration; companies from environmentally risky sectors; profitability; the firm’s size; growth opportunities; and dept.

Considering the global concern that companies should align their corporate sustainability goals to international requirements, Zhang et al. (2020) propose using indicators from the global reporting initiative (GRI) for the corporate sustainability disclosure of firms. However, Zhang et al. (2020) assure that there are still challenges because firms in different countries may have a different understanding of corporate sustainability compared to international guidelines, such as those established in the GRI.

Also, Weber and Chowdury (2020) point out the relevance of evaluating corporate sustainability by separating indicators into four groups: social sustainability, environmental sustainability, green products; and services. With a more in-depth approach, Ikram et al. (2020) believe that more categories are needed in order to value specific aspects of the firms, such as social sustainability. In specific, Ikram et al. (2020) proposes nine categories: Corporate Governance; Product Responsibility; Transparency and Communication; Economic; Environmental; Social; Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability; Energy Consumption; and Pandemic COVID-19 impact. The proposed diverse categories to evaluate corporate sustainability is aligned with the current needs of companies to achieve “real” sustainability, because the traditional triple bottom line of sustainability is not sufficient and may even lead to a business-as-usual perspective, as mentioned by Milne and Gray (2013).

In complement to this, it is relevant to issue how different perspectives on sustainability by managers can influence on decision-making, whether they are more radical or moderate. About this, Hahn et al. (2014) assure that the team setting of a company should be diverse in terms of views on problem-solution and sustainability issues. Authors affirm that if teams are dominated by business case-minded (more focused on economic objectives) or paradoxical types (with higher awareness on environmental and social issues), they may be less successful in achieving a significant corporate sustainability performance, while a mixed team may be better in these terms.

Interestingly, Baumgartner and Rauter (2017) argue that to achieve expected corporate sustainability standards, it is important to explore how management can contribute to creating value for businesses, society and nature. Mainly, the authors defend that performance could be improved through strategic management, specifically looking at its three dimensions: strategy process, strategy content, and strategy context. Thus, this may strengthen the relationship between strategic management and the sustainable development of a company.

# 2.2 Main findings in literature review papers on corporate sustainability

In terms of literature review papers on corporate sustainability, there are more than a dozen relevant articles, each with its own focus. Precisely for this reason, it is worth giving a brief description of some of them, as follows.

## Goyal et al. (2013)
- Developed a descriptive analysis of papers published between 1992 and 2011 on corporate sustainability performance.
- Data collected from the following databases: Emerald Full Text; EBSCOs; Elsevier’s Science Direct; JSTOR; Taylor & Francis; and Springer-Verlag.
- Search keywords: “corporate sustainability performance”, “green”, “triple bottom line”, “environment performance”, and “CSR”.
- In total, 101 papers were selected for the quantitative descriptive analysis.
- Identified a trend toward evaluating corporate sustainability from an integrated perspective, considering social, environmental, and economic issues jointly.

## Engert et al. (2016)
- Reviewed 114 articles through descriptive and content analysis methods published until 2014.
- Key search terms: strategic; strategy; strategies; management; corporate sustainability; sustainability; environmental; green; eco; ecological; social; socially; ethical; responsible; and responsibility.
- Databases for this review: Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.
- Showed an increasing number of publications in the corporate sustainability field and a need for more empirical research.

## Van der Byl and Slawinski (2015)
- Undertook an extensive literature and content review to assess tensions of corporate sustainability regarding the balance between economic, social, and environmental aspects.
- Selected 149 papers from 2003 to 2014 from top-tier management and strategy journals.
- Focused on corporate sustainability and tensions related to four approaches: win–win; trade-off; integrative; and paradox.
- Identified that the win–win approach seeks to reconcile social or environmental issues with economic goals, while the trade-off approach puts these issues into conflict.

## Lozano (2015)
- Argued that there is not much application of theories of firm on corporate sustainability.
- Reviewed the most used theories and how they contribute to corporate sustainability.
- Did not undertake a specific process to choose literature but focused on what is considered adequate.
- Results showed that each theory is limited to addressing a particular dimension of corporate sustainability, but a sustainability-oriented theory of firm could gather elements of each theory to align with and contribute to corporate sustainability.

## Diez-Cañamero et al. (2020)
- Argued that there are no specific instruments that can support an alignment of companies to achieve similar corporate sustainability.
- Identified common indexes, ranking, and ratings of corporate sustainability systems to organize a common proposition that could support corporate sustainability development on a larger scale.
- The documents reviewed in this study were articles and...

# A systematic literature review on corporate sustainability

## Overview
Reports that specially applied corporate sustainability systems within 2010 and 2019. The authors did not specify particular keywords or database systems to search documents but focused on specific websites and reports. The authors conclude that the different approaches to measuring corporate sustainability cause a biased view of sustainability, leading to a diminished importance of sustainable development.

## Corporate Sustainability and Organizational Capabilities
With a focus on corporate sustainability and organizational capabilities, da Cunha Bezerra et al. (2020) proposes a framework based on a systematic literature review under a descriptive approach. The papers reviewed by the authors were found in the web of science database, considering those that were published until February of 2019. The keywords used for the search are related to capabilities, sustainability social performance, and social responsibility. Papers were filtered based on the literature review’s focus, which led to the consideration of 88 articles. The results of da Cunha Bezerra et al. (2020) indicate that corporate sustainability is closely related to business strategy and the development of specific organizational capabilities.

## Gap Between Policy and Implementation
Arguing that there is a gap between policy and implementation regarding corporate sustainability, Ahmed et al. (2021), through a systematic literature review, explores factors that make implementing corporate sustainability policies difficult. With this aim, Ahmed et al. (2021) selected 107 papers published between 1950 and 2020 in six major editorial groups: Wiley; Taylor and Francis; Emerald; Springer; Sage; and Elsevier. The keywords for the search were: policy; small and medium enterprise; sustainability; Corporate Social Responsibility; corporate sustainability; corporate ethics; corporate philanthropy; corporate citizenship; and corporate sustainability responsibility. Results of this review show that adequate policymaking on corporate sustainability is closely related to several business approaches such as the grassroots approach, environmental impact assessment, evidence-based practice approach, and systematic integrated sustainability assessment.

## Importance of Management Accounting
Schaltegger et al. (2022) highlight the importance of understanding the role of management accounting on corporate sustainability. Within this context, the authors undertake a systematic literature review on sustainability management accounting, based on content analysis. In this review, the 62 papers selected were articles published until 2019 focusing on environmental, social, and sustainability accounting found in five databases: EBSCO Host-Business Source Premier (BSP); JSTOR; ScienceDirect; Scopus; and Web of Science. This study identifies that the literature shows a timid relationship between the micro-level of sustainable management accounting with a company’s meso and macro organizational levels, which means that there are still challenges with regard to extending sustainable management accounting beyond organizational barriers.

## Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management
Based on the diverse existing challenges for companies to balance economic, social, and environmental goals, Luo et al. (2020) conducted a systematic literature review on corporate sustainability paradox management. The 141 papers selected were published in high ranking journals dedicated to management and sustainability until December 2019. The authors undertook a content analysis of the selected papers and concluded that environmental and cognitive factors create tensions to adopt sustainable solutions; proactive strategies are more present in studies related to corporate sustainability and result more effective in the short- and long-term sustainable goals of a company; and strategies to manage corporate sustainability paradoxes deals with complex business scenarios, on the multi-level and multi-stage approach.

## Human Resource Management Perspective
From a human resources perspective, Kainzbauer et al. (2021) conducted a bibliometric analysis to understand how sustainable human resource management contributes to corporate sustainability.

# 3 Materials and methods

Methodologically, this research was supported by a SLR. Its function is to organize the knowledge disseminated over the last ten years (between 2011 and 2020) on the topic of corporate sustainability, thus increasing the visibility of this subject (Meredith, 1993) and contributing to the topic’s investigative process (Easterby-Smith et al., 2002), in addition to providing a historical perspective and the consolidation efforts in this area of knowledge.

According to Gough et al. (2012), SLR is a structured, transparent and reproducible method, characterized by being an objective, replicable approach that, according to Badi and Murtagh (2019), can provide a comprehensive knowledge of scientific research published in a given field of study. The aim of a literature review is to identify gaps in the literature (Tranfield et al., 2003), as well as to address existing limitations on a given topic (De Oliveira et al., 2018). For Wee and Banister (2016), a literature review should gather the research material in a structured way, adding value by discussing relevant aspects and raising promising paths for future research, based on key and emerging topics (Seuring et al., 2005).

In general, SLR begins with clarifying the scope of the research (Agi et al., 2020), followed by the objective of the review (Agi et al., 2020; Tranfield et al., 2003), with a well-defined strategy for data search (Agi et al., 2020; De Oliveira et al., 2018; Tranfield et al., 2003), and collection of research material (Agi et al., 2020; De Oliveira et al., 2018; Tranfield et al., 2003). For Tseng et al. (2019), SLR has four stages, which, in short, involve the identification of data, the screening of initial data, the determination of eligibility and, finally, the inclusion of data.

Taking into account the notes covered in the previous paragraphs, this SLR followed the steps presented in Fig. 1, as a structured research protocol.

In order to focus on the research, the first step started from clarifying its scope and also its objective, which are duly pointed out in the introduction section of this research.

The second step consisted in choosing the database for the research, which in this case was the Web of Science (WoS). Considered one of the main databases in terms of content volume (Abrizah et al., 2013), the platform had more than 38 million publications in its collection for more than a decade (Vieira & Gomes, 2009). Such information reinforces

# Citation Analysis of Publications in Computer Science

The CitNetExplorer software analyzed 1756 citation links, derived from references cited by papers on CS published on WoS, in the period from 2011 to 2020. Figures 6 and 7, which were generated from this software, have the following parameters:

- Each circle represents a publication;
- Publications are labeled by the last name of the first author;
- To avoid overlapping labels, some labels may not be displayed;
- The horizontal location of a publication is determined by its citations relations with other publications;
- The vertical location of a publication is determined by its publication year;
- The curved lines represent citation relations;
- Citations point in upward direction;
- The cited publication is always located above the citing publication.

## Visualization of Cited Publications

Figure 6 allows the visualization of most frequently cited publications (select based on their Citation Score) and their connections (links). It is interesting to note that countless publications from past decades have been used to compose the theoretical framework of the publications of the last ten years on CS, with a significant part of these publications maintaining a citation relationship (see curved lines) with current publications.

In the center of Fig. 6, we can see the Dyllick’s seminal paper publication, “Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability”, that among the publications that directly address the topic CS is the one with the highest Citation Score index. From Fig. 7, we can see the unfolding of the work of Dyllick and Hockerts (2002) in several other publications, expanding the visual information of the previous figure.

## Citation Networks and Research Areas

Although Figs. 6 and 7 allow the visualization of the most relevant citation networks and their relationship with other citations over time, it is not possible to extract from these figures what are the main areas of investigation, how these areas are related, or even what are the most active research areas. Thus, in order to answer these questions, the CiteSpace software was used. According to Chen (2006), CiteSpace is software designed to generate an “X-ray” of an area of knowledge represented by a set of bibliographic records from relevant publications. Figure 8, which illustrates the most active areas of research on CS in the past ten years, was developed by CiteSpace.

Clusters are numbered in descending order of cluster size, starting with the largest cluster #0, the second largest #1, and so on. In this case, the largest area (#0 sustainability governance characteristics) has the largest number of members’ references, being, therefore, the subject that has had the most activity in the last decade.

Of these clusters, one that draws attention is the seventh (#6 including covid-19 insight), which is understandable because the world has reached a critical point of volatility due to the emergence of COVID-19 (Karnama & Vinuesa, 2020), which would thus justify the growing interest of the scientific community in research that includes aspects of the 2020 Pandemic.

In Fig. 8, the total time span is from 2011 to 2020 and the clusters show the most important traces of related research activities. Each dot represents a node in the network, which are the citations. And the lines that connect the nodes are co-citations links. The colors of these lines are designed to show when a connection was made for the first time. Color coding makes it easy to identify which part of the network is old (lilac shade) and which is recent (yellow shade).

# 4.4 Contributions of corporate sustainability to organizations

A large part of the CS contributions are linked to the improvement in environmental management related to areas close to the organizations, where the increments may be related to cultivation and preservation in high standard environments, continuous control of environmental pollution, protection for threatened plants and animals, implementation of successful environmental protection programs, optimal use of resources and anticipation of possible problems related to the environment. CS improves business performance and reputation, reducing or eliminating risks and linking operations to results that can improve the common good.

However, its implementation only has the power to become a rich source of competitiveness if the opportunities related to sustainable development are properly identified. Integrating CS into the company’s strategy is more than a responsibility, being essential that each business recognizes the need to be socially, environmentally and financially sustainable in order to survive over time.

The adoption of CS contributes to eco-innovation, responsible leadership, sustainable and organizational culture, as well as the need to adopt certifications such as ISO 14001 to accelerate the company’s commitment to sustainable issues. It was also observed the establishment of partnerships between companies and NGOs that defend the environmental cause, generating improvements, legitimacy and value for both parties.

In addition to the environmental context, there were several contexts regarding the financial aspect triggered by sustainable practices, such as the improvement in the relationship with investors, long-term returns in times of financial crisis, creating long-term value for business owners through the exploitation of opportunities and risk management, environmental and social governance activities positively affecting economic performance, and image improvement before the entire market.

It was found that both early adopters of CS and late adopters benefit greatly. The pioneer receives all payment from stakeholders in the sustainability market, while late adopters gain an advantage as they benefit from cumulative side effects in an explored and expanded market. Foreign ownership positively impacts the level of adoption of CS, as the pressure exerted ends up being greater, culminating in a need for constant training of the workforce.

In the internal environment, experiences with CS encourage managers to devote more attention to environmental and social problems, as well as the leading role of leadership in their application, in addition to promoting employee involvement. The establishment of gender diversity on the company’s board, for example, has a significant positive impact on the financial performance of the business.

The public sector realized the importance of such knowledge and drives progress in sustainability through state-led projects with the development of concepts and legislation. More specifically related to that country’s financial sector, green credit policies have increased the CS of banks and/or helped to create a more stable and successful sector.

# 4.5 Barriers to the Adoption of Corporate Sustainability by Organizations

As presented in the previous section, the application of CS is seen as fundamental in organizations of all types and sectors, but there are several obstacles to its implementation.

Among the difficulties imposed, barriers related to the adoption of sustainable practices by employees were mentioned in several studies. Some examples are:
- The inability to motivate managers with high school education level (Henry et al., 2019)
- The internal difficulty with managers and other employees (Ashrafi et al., 2019; Pechancova et al., 2019)
- The lack of internal understanding (Stahl et al., 2020)
- The lack of human resources management (Sadatsafavi & Walevski, 2013)
- The wage gap (Gomez-Bezares et al., 2019)
```

# A systematic literature review on corporate sustainability

The lack of guidance on CS is another barrier in its implementation (Ahern, 2015; Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017; Deng et al., 2017), as well as the different internal perceptions about this topic that can cause difficulty in its dissemination (Nyuur et al., 2020). The lack of understanding on the subject also occurs in the process of selecting appropriate economic, environmental and social indicators for measuring sustainability, which has several methodological structures and a wide range of assumptions (Nikolaou et al., 2019).

CS needs to be anchored in the economic, environmental and social sphere, but the sources and indicators used, normally, focus only on economic factors, resulting in the mistaken recognition that sustainability is an optional contribution, rather than something present in the company’s culture (Schneider & Mein, 2012). Another important point is that just “institutional pressure” is not enough to improve the sustainable performance. The allocation of financial and human resources is also necessary for the practices to be effectively completed (Mishra et al., 2020).

Another relevant aspect refers to the communication of the companies’ sustainable activities, which usually occurs through the sustainability report. As there is no specific standard for the dissemination of results, erroneous or incomplete disclosure of data to specialists, partners and investors becomes common (Barkemeyer et al., 2015; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2019; Klettner et al., 2014; Lee, 2019).

According to Bae et al. (2018), another barrier involves difficulties related to the family management mode, very common in different parts of the world, in which the family benefit is seen as superior to the negative effects generated for society and other.

| Lack of guidance                  |                              |

# 4.6 Guidelines for the adoption of corporate sustainability by organizations

It was found that the search for certifications is a relevant path for the adoption of CS, as they contain basic guidelines for obtaining the titles (Ramos et al., 2013), mainly in sectors with high environmental impact (Ashrafi et al., 2019). However, organizations need to see it beyond a mere certification with an environmental focus and clearly address the social aspect (Maletic et al., 2015). NGOs are important actors for implementing CS in an effective, planned and positive way (Lee, 2019; Joensuu et al., 2015).

The dissemination of sustainable culture from the creation of the position of "Chief Sustainability Officer" (CSO) within organizations is a viable way for its implementation to occur (Henry et al., 2019). If the manager has extensive previous experience in sustainability issues, the results tend to be positive in the long term (Peters et al., 2019).

As an alternative or complement to the creation of a specific position, investment in training for the existing workforce, the use of local labor, and the improvement of internal processes are factors that assist performance, in addition to promoting a broad and sustainable philosophy (Lloret, 2016). Companies can use the leadership of their team members to create a favorable and collaborative environment for the innovation process linked to sustainability, offering employees training, rewards and a system for monitoring innovation performance (Lampikoski et al., 2014; Pellegrini et al., 2018; Tomsic et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017a, 2017b). The emphasis on human development and training in the workplace should focus on environmental practices and the exercise of power to transform pollution prevention thinking to promote sustainable actions (Feng & Ngai, 2020).

Investment in Research & Development also plays an important role, as it promotes innovative products and modern technologies that improve the efficiency of the entire organization, including the sustainable aspect (Zillur et al., 2015).

# 4.7 Innovations on corporate sustainability

In addition to the guidelines, the analyzed documents detailed innovative approaches to review the adoption and measurement of this topic. Table 5 highlights the main ones:

- Innovations in segmented markets were also observed, such as exploring the sustainability performance of Chinese banks (Weber, 2017).
- Creating an index to measure CS in the cruise industry (Bonilla-Priego et al., 2014).
- The proposition of 5 radical models to examine the sustainability rate of Japanese industrial sectors (Sueyoshi & Goto, 2014).
- Identification of 87 sustainability-related indicators for the fashion industry (Kozlowski et al., 2015).
- A tool for analyzing the dimensions of sustainability in Ecuadorian cooperatives (Alicvar et al., 2020).
- Sustainable innovation model for energy companies (de Almeida & de Melo, 2017).
- An analytical scheme for the generation and capture of the value of Mexican companies (Lloret, 2016).
- Analysis of materiality for companies related to water technology (Calabrese et al., 2019).
- Its adoption by Italian companies in the wine sector (Annunziata et al., 2018).

Adding to the list of the previous paragraph, other topics were found, among them the addition of social media to the decision-making analysis process (Tseng, 2017), the use of innovation games as a roadmap for the development of value creation strategies (Lampikoski et al., 2014), the configuration of behaviors with the provision of incentives to employees in conjunction with human resource management tools (Sadasfavi & Walewski, 2013), and the classification of the types of trade-offs through a hierarchical structure (Haffar & Searcy, 2017).

To conclude this section, the most recent innovation observed on CS refers to the inclusion of COVID-19 as a new attribute of sustainable business practices. Ikram et al. (2020) believe that after the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations will be sensitized to achieve a more sustainable business environment, developing an indicator structure that has 45 sustainability subcriteria, classified according to the nine main categories (Corporate Governance, Transparency and Communication, Product Responsibility, Environment, Social, Economy, Natural Environment and Climate Change, Energy Consumption and Economy and Pandemic). COVID-19 is even included as one of the research clusters on CS, as shown in Fig. 8 (see Sect. 4.3).

# 5 Agenda and future research directions

This section will discuss the recommendations of future research that were observed in the papers included in the SLR, emphasizing CS pathways that remain open.

## 5.1 Recommendations for future research that remain open

In the field of Human Resources, the possible connection between sustainability and wage disparity, recommended by Gomez-Bezares et al. (2019), remains without new materials. Zahid et al. (2020) studied about gender diversity in business boards in Malaysia, but found the need for a broader discussion and in different realities. In the case of Lozano et al. (2017), the study happened by segmenting managers’ understanding of the complexities and multidimensional issue of CS in Japan, where the authors recommended the development of research to analyze experiences on this topic in the West and East, verifying what can be translated into other territories and cultures.

## 5.2 Recommendations of relevant future research

Liu and Yan (2018) argued about the need to focus on sustainability projects and failed attempts, so that complementary theoretical views can be confronted with those that were successful in their implementation. New studies are suggested to understand where and when to spend on more sustainable policies, especially in the context of bringing more benefits to shareholders. Tarquinio et al. (2018) propose the future creation of a system of indicators to summarize the overall performance of the businesses, with the aim of providing a valuable view of the information in sustainability reports.

The macro-environmental issue also has open studies, mainly in climate change and global warming, topics suggested by Linnenluecke and Griffiths (2013), as well as the use of Smart Technologies to assist CS (Hack & Berg, 2014; Saunila et al., 2019). Table 6 includes the main recommendations found in the analyzed materials:

Through the insertion of new technologies in the industrial context, at a time led by 5G together with Industry 4.0, there are several possibilities for their insertion in the context of CS. According to Seele (2017), it will be possible to predict most of the problems related to sustainability and not just analyze what has already been published. The opportunity for studies in this area is relevant, as the use of Big Data as a complementary element to traditional approaches has gained relevance in recent years (Bala et al., 2015; Weber, 2017; Serafeim, 2020).

Studies related to consumer perception regarding CS are lacking, since the analyzed materials contribute to internal understanding, whether with employees or suppliers. The study by Stolz and Bautista (2015) addresses the external perception, but related to audiences belonging to a segmented age group and location, as well as the material by Tomsic et al. (2015), which also analyzes the economic issues of small and medium-sized companies. With the growing concern about sustainable development, it is an opportunity to understand what consumers see of value when choosing certain brands, checking if the sustainable issue is taken into account, as suggested by Jones et al. (2017).

It was found in the review that issues related to Human Resources are predominant for the application of CS (Gomez-Bezares et al., 2019; Lueg et al., 2015; Zahid et al., 2020). Therefore, studies that help better forms of engagement, diversity, perception, reward and leadership of employees will bring valuable information for the adoption of sustainable practices, inserting them into the organization’s culture. People must understand the new


# Conclusion

To achieve the objectives of the present research, 221 articles were selected, downloaded, and analyzed. These articles have corporate sustainability as their central theme, with a significant part of the material focused on environmental issues. As a time frame, we worked with articles published in the last ten years, where it was possible to observe a growth in researchers’ interest in this topic year after year. In 2011, for example, we had only five articles published (see Fig. 3), while in 2020 we had 43 articles. Analyzing year by year, there is an average annual growth rate of publications around 27%.

Although a large part of the research contributions on CS is linked to improvement in environmental management (cultivation and preservation in high-standard environments, continuous control of environmental pollution, protection for threatened plants and animals, implementation of successful environmental protection programs, optimal use of resources and anticipation of possible problems related to the environment), many other relevant approaches were observed, such as improving performance and business reputation, interaction with producers and stakeholders, financial performance, bioeconomics, improvement in the human resources with content related to gender diversity, employee involvement and leadership, and, finally, the implementation of CS in sectors that are still unexplored. Specifically, regarding the improvement in business performance and reputation, there is a search for certifications, improvement in risk management, foreign ownership, and relations with investors and partnerships with interested parties, of which NGOs, suppliers, and the government are present.

Regarding the sector (business segment/type of business) where these papers were applied, the diversity of application areas is impressive, of which stand out those of agri-food, banks, consumers, ocean cruises, aquaculture, oil, energy, manufacturing, fashion, ports, technology, among many others. Concerning methodological procedures, these surveys were, in the vast majority of times, conducted by case studies, interviews, structured and semi-structured surveys, and mathematical modeling.

As opportunities on this topic, it was possible to understand the main barriers faced for the adoption of CS linked to the management area, whether in the allocation of financial resources or flawed indicators; the human resources area, with difficulties in its adoption by employees, lack of management, or lack of internal understanding; to the

# Research Findings on Corporate Sustainability (CS)

## Overview
- Numerous recommendations were observed to overcome barriers in understanding the topic of Corporate Sustainability (CS).
- Key recommendations include:
  - Investment in the Research & Development sector.
  - Implementation of an efficient communication process through the Sustainability Report.
  - Dissemination of sustainable culture via the role of Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO).

## Innovations in CS
- In the last ten years, research has led to:
  - Creation of an index for the cruise industry.
  - Identification of 87 indicators for the fashion industry.
  - Inclusion of COVID-19 as a new attribute of sustainable business practices.
- The first research cluster identified is "sustainability governance characteristics," which has seen significant activity in the last decade.

## Future Research Directions
- Suggested areas for further research:
  - Problems related to Sustainability Reports.
  - Lack of standardization in these documents.
  - Communication failures in accountability for sustainable practices.
- Key questions for exploration:
  - What measurable gains could "adequate" Sustainability Reports bring to CS?
  - How much would a Sustainability Report inspire stakeholders to make positive decisions?

## Limitations
- The research was limited to articles published on the Web of Science database.
- Search arguments included "Corporate Sustainability" and "Environmental" directed towards environmental bias.
- Future research should consider other databases like SCOPUS for a broader perspective.

## Conclusion
- The article is recommended for researchers and academics looking to update their knowledge on CS.
- The systematic literature review (SLR) provides a comprehensive view of studies on this topic.
