        "text": "HRM includes research by K. Piwowar-Sulej [69] on the development of future competencies of industrial engineers in Poland. This group is responsible for the implementation of Industry 4.0 concept and cleaner production in the country. As K. Piwowar-Sulej’s research suggests, industrial companies in Poland tend to be short-sighted when developing the potential of their engineers. The author concludes that the HR development practices focus mainly on current and ongoing needs, there is a lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, and the environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training. This also could be one of the factors contributing to the low correlation to the environmental aspect in this research.\n\nOther existing research relates to the role of HR department managers and was done by K. Drela [32]. The results of her research confirmed that HR managers of enterprises operating in the area of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship play a very active role in managing the initiatives related to sustainable development, and in introducing sustainability measures into corporate strategies. The results obtained by K. Drela further confirm and strengthen the role of HR in Corporate Sustainability.\n\nAs existing research results are not coherent, it seems worth consulting a wider-group research, encompassing varied employee groups and industry sectors to obtain a more comprehensive view on a national scale.\n\nThe limitations of the research group were also a limitation for this research. The research group represented only a part of the organizations operating in Podlasie. Furthermore, the research group was comprised of MBA students only. Hence, it encompassed only some members of the HR departments of the researched organizations. Therefore, one of the further research ideas include conducting the research with a bigger research group of Podlasie companies, and thus creating a more complete database for the country.\n\nMoreover, further research could also focus on other regions within the country to contribute to a wider data collection. The research model created in this research has wide applications, as it can be used in research without geographical limitations. It can also be utilized in varied sectors (public or business) and branches of the economy. What is more, the research in particular regions could be repeated on a regular basis. The results thereof could serve as the basis for following the process of Corporate Sustainability implementation.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nB.M. and A.W. confirm that their contribution in each stage of the preparation of this article was equal.

The highest number of correlations was observed between the strategic and psychological aspects, and the least—between the strategic and environmental ones.\n\n# 3.2.1. The Strategic Aspect and the Social Aspect\n\nStrong correlations were observed between strategic statements 2 and 5 (“HR has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan”; “I think my organization could be a model for other organizations when it comes to promoting sustainability activities”) and social statements 1 and 2 (actions for older workers and different age groups), as well as between strategic statement 4 (“I see benefits for the company from taking initiatives for sustainability”) and the social statement 1. The other observed correlations are moderate.\n\n# 3.2.2. The Strategic Aspect and the Psychological Aspect\n\nCorrelations exist between most of the statements that make up both the strategic and psychological aspects. A strong positive relationship was observed between statements 4–6 of the strategic aspect (noticing the benefits of taking actions for sustainability, the organization can be a model in this field, an opportunity for the HR department to raise its strategic position) and the psychological statement 1 (treating employees as a key resource in the organization), between strategic statements 4 and 6 and psychological statement 5 (covering the costs of training by the company) and between strategic statements 5 and 6 and psychological statements 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in sustainable development behaviour). The remaining observed correlations are of moderate strength.\n\n# 3.2.3. The Strategic Aspect and the Ecological Aspect\n\nOut of the 6 statements that make up the strategic aspect, only 3 correlate with selected statements that make up the ecological aspect. The strength of the correlation is weak to moderate. Strategic statement 1 (involvement of the HR department in creating sustainable development policy) is correlated with statements 1–3 and 5–6 that make up the ecological aspect. Strategic statement 2 (introducing sustainability into a company’s action plan) correlates with environmental statements 1–4, and strategic statement 5 (organization as a model for promoting sustainability activities) with environmental statements 1 and 2.\n\nSummarizing the analysis of the correlation between the strategic aspect of Sustainable HRM and the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, one can observe an emerging tendency that correlations occur more often and with greater power between these variants of answers, constituting particular aspects in which enterprises take specific actions, which confirms the usefulness of the adopted research model.\n\n# 3.3. Multiple Regression of the Strategic Aspect in Relation to the Social, Psychological, and Ecological Aspects\n\nIn order to establish the relationship between the variables forming the individual Sustainable HRM dimensions, regression models were constructed. Six regression models, in which the dependent variables were individual questions concerning the strategic aspect, while the independent variables were questions concerning the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, were examined. Regression models for dependent variables strategic (i − 1,..., 6) are described by the equation:\n\nSTi = α0 +∑αj ∗ SOj +∑αj+6 ∗ Pj +∑αj+12 ∗ Ej\n\nwhere ST—Strategic; SO—Social; P—Psychological; E—Ecological.\n\nThe normality of the rest of the regression model was checked in each case. Based on the scattering plots of the model residuals with respect to the predicted residuals, it was concluded that the residuals were homoscedastic and non-correlated, and the existence of outliers in the model was checked on the basis of Cook’s distance. Analysis of the PLOTS of predicted residual values for all models showed that they are constructed correctly. The residuals in the model have normal distributions, and residual homoscedasticity is present. Cook’s distance analysis also shows that there are no outliers in the individual models.\n\nThe only significant variable that influences the Strategic Aspect 1 is the Psychological 3 aspect of providing employees with coaching. R2 in the model is 0.55, and the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is 0.00011.\n\nThe Strategic aspect 2 is influenced by the Social aspect 1. The Fisher test shows that the model is statistically significant, with p-value 0.00011 and R2 for the model 0.55.\n\nThe factor with a statistically significant impact on the Strategic aspect 3 is the Ecological aspect 3. The model as a whole is statistically significant, as evidenced by the p-value in the Fisher test p = 0.0052. R2 in the model is 0.45.\n\nIn model 4, the factors significantly influencing the Strategic 4 variable are the Psychological 1, Psychological 4, Psychological 5, and Ecological 1 aspects, where the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is p < 0.0000 and R2 is 0.69.\n\nIn the regression model 5, the Strategic 5 variable is significantly influenced by Social 1 and Psychological 6 aspects. R2 in the model is 0.61, while the p-value in the model significance test is 0.0001.\n\nIn the last constructed regression model, the Strategic 6 variable is significantly influenced by the Psychological 1 and Psychological 4 variables. R2 in the model is 0.57, while the p-value in the Fisher significance test is 0.0003.\n\nTo"

Therefore, to fill the aforementioned research gap, this study used psychological ownership theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV. This study explored the relationships of GSV with employee green confusion (EGC) and employee environmental performance (EEP) as well as the mediating effect of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. The research results indicate that GSV positively affects GPPO, EGC, and EEP. Moreover, GSV also influences behavior and performance through personal psychological processes. Thus, if an enterprise wishes to establish GSV, it must adopt a series of supporting measures, including improving members’ GPPO, to effectively reduce EGC and improve EEP to realize the goal of sustainable development.\n\n# Keywords\n\ngreen shared vision; psychological ownership theory; green product psychological ownership; employee green confusion; employee environmental performance\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nCorporate strategies worldwide are affected by environmental management issues [1]. When enterprises support environmental protection and actively participate in environmental management, they not only pursue corporate values but also improve their image by complying with environmental regulations [2]. Enterprises should embrace the philosophy of sustainability with a creative mind in this environmentalistic age [3, 4]. In general, shared visions are developed at the organizational, group, or individual levels to generate motivation for achieving transformation from a present status to a desirable end status [5]. When the organizational planner has a strong vision, the sustainable development of a company is promoted [6]. Obtaining a better understanding of the driving forces behind the phenomena might help new companies to integrate resources and enhance their corporate performance [7]. A corporate shared vision is a key factor affecting the competitive advantage of a corporation over other entities. Currently, sustainable development has become an important issue worldwide. The pursuit and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) has become a trend for companies. Therefore, corporate sustainability has become a major topic.\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 10514; doi:10.3390/su122410514 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\nCorporate sustainability refers to decreasing the waste of natural resources (especially nonrenewable resources) to zero during enterprise operational activities to reduce the damage caused by corporate activities on society or the environment [8]. Corporate sustainability has become an indispensable strategy for many companies today [9 – 11]. Such strategies are gradually being integrated into company activities and culture, whether with respect to the corporate system (including operations), strategies, organizational systems, or stakeholders (internal and external as well as social and environmental) [12]. Corporate sustainability has become the basis of sustainable success [13]. When employees and organizations have different values, implementing a developed sustainability plan is difficult [14]. Employees are the core resource of an enterprise [15]. Employees play an important role in maintaining the competitive advantage of an organization. They also determine the performance of the organization [16]. A company’s ability to achieve a competitive advantage is related to its ability to employ excellent talent [17].\n\nGiven the aforementioned information, employees play an important role when designing sustainable development strategies for an enterprise. The occurrence of employee green confusion (EGC) cannot be ruled out when employees promote green shared vision (GSV). However, studies on green confusion have not focused on the views of an enterprise’s employees. Most of these studies have examined consumer orientation and have focused on the effects of greenwash on consumers, such as the effects of greenwash on green consumer confusion and green trust [18] as well as environmental and product perceptions [19]. Thus, employee orientation related to confusion in the field of corporate sustainability has been rarely discussed. To fill this research gap, the present study proposes a new concept called EGC. This study refers to the definition of Chen and Chang [18] to define EGC as the confusion of employees regarding the environmental characteristics of company products or services. The present study developed an integral framework of employee environmental performance (EEP). It also investigated the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP as well as the mediating effects of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. Environmentalism is an important corporate issue today, and EEP is critical to corporate sustainability. This research enables a better understanding of the effects of a shared vision and various types of integration on corporate management.\n\nStudies have rarely used a theoretical basis to explore the effect of organizational members’ psychological processes on the organization’s environmental management performance [1, 20 – 26]. This study investigated the effect of GSV on GPPO, EGC, and EEP by focusing on company staff and using psychological ownership (PO) theory and expected price theory. We used the obtained findings to fill the research gap on EGC issues in corporate sustainability research. This study proposes a comprehensive conceptual structure to explore the effect of company members’ psychological processes regarding the company’s green"

        "text": "corporate sustainability has become more commonly accepted in China, there has been no agreed-upon definition of it. Therefore, the standardisation and the regulations of corporate sustainability in China are in a great need of development (Bai et al., 2015).\n\n# 2.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines in China\n\nIn China, the GRI (2013) guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reportings. In recent decades, GRI has attempted to provide comprehensive guidelines for CSD by setting indicators in corporate economic, environmental and social sustainability (Chauvey et al., 2015). Firms that adopt GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines need to report their strategy in the company profiles, explain their management approach as to how they address corporate sustainability practices and disclose their company sustainability (economic, environmental and social) performance (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). GRI, overall, provides companies with information on how and what to report in CSD.\n\nWhile GRI provides such comprehensive sets of guidelines on CSR, it ultimately aims to enhance companies’ information transparency and overall accountability. This has elevated the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to become the most commonly used framework internationally (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). The KPMG Questionnaire into CSR (KPMG, 2008) examined the top 250 companies listed on the Fortune Global 500 and the 100 largest firms by revenue in 22 countries. The results showed that more than 75 per cent of companies from the Fortune Global 500 and 70 per cent of the 100 largest revenue firms applied the GRI. GRI is also considered practical for firms to use as report preparers are able to self-examine their own level of corporate sustainability performance.\n\nAs suggested by Brown et al. (2009), GRI is significant in terms of its “broad range of stakeholders” approach, as well as institutionalising multi-stakeholders on reporting and accountability. However, Drori et al. (2006) indicated that GRI is mostly presented by multinational companies on a global basis and international accounting firms have large influence on standardising the guidelines. Western multinational firms, therefore, help to set the agenda on corporate sustainability reporting based on their own interests (Vigneau et al., 2015). It is suggested that “the guidelines’ lack of universal applicability creates a perceived unfairness inherent in imposing Western standards of social behaviour and associated reporting practices” (Adams and McNicholas, 2007, p. 484).\n\nNevertheless, GRI remains highly authoritative globally because of its context, language, concepts and assumptions (Brown et al., 2009). It has a significant role to highlight the importance of corporate sustainability reporting and has led to new practices of corporate sustainability and responsibility (Vigneau et al., 2015). Hopkins (2004) also contends that the GRI guidelines include some aspects of the other popular environmental and social guidelines, such as the ISO 14000 and the global Sullivan principles.\n\n# 2.3 Perceptions and motivations of sustainability in China\n\nEarly studies on the topic of perception of CSR in the Chinese context have broadly discussed the differential impact to measure CSR based on the Western and the Chinese definitions. Both Western and Chinese literature indicates that corporate sustainability is, to some degree, directly related to shareholders and companies values, as well as the need for the companies to be legitimate and ethical. Cultural differences have also created some different perceptions about corporate sustainability in the West and the East. Many studies, which were conducted in China, into Chinese culture and corporate sustainability, have explored the idea of profits from righteousness (Yi) principle, derived from Confucius.\n\nAnother stream of studies on CSR perception in China is generally focused on the potential of political interference and government intervention, and it examines the disclosure content to reveal the propensity for firms to report on government policies (Gao, 2011; Kuo et al., 2012; Li and Zhang, 2010; Marquis and Qian, 2014). Kuo et al. (2012), based on a content analysis of Chinese data obtained from CSR reports, found that environmental sensitivity and ownership structures distinguish corporate environmental disclosures. Sensitive industries and government-owned firms are found to be more committed to providing environmental disclosures than less-sensitive industries and non-government-owned firms. They were also highly engaged in energy saving, carbon reduction, research and application of new techniques – beneficial activities that assist China in dealing with the global warming issue. Kuo et al.’s (2012) study also suggested that the Chinese government has an important role in promoting corporate CSR engagement.\n\nMarquis and Qian (2014) examined corporate strategic response to government signals through CSR disclosure. They examined 1,600 listed firms between 2006 and 2009, and their results supported the findings of Kuo et al. (2012) that the Chinese government’s signalling is a critical driver for corporate reporting, particularly for the SOEs that exert substantial political influence. Further, they found that the reporting companies are highly subjective to decoupling risk under specific monitoring mechanism. The expectation of policymakers drove the reported CSR practices.\n\nGao (2011) found that the listed companies in the Chinese financial market had, overall, a positive attitude to engage in CSR. Specifically, they found that SOEs have a higher tendency to engage in social issues through CSR than the non-SOEs. Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.\n\nThrough a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”. They"

        "text": "social issues through CSR than the non-SOEs. Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.\n\nThrough a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”. They discussed the multiplexity of the business system and its impact on the CSR concepts in the Chinese context. In particular, they examined the “authorisation capitalism” within the family owned small and medium firms, which suggested that the CSR engagement in these types of firms was oriented to local concern and driven by the local community’s perception of the CSR.\n\n# 2.3.1 Users’ perceived importance of corporate sustainability disclosure in China\n\nWhile existing literature in Chinese CSR has focused more on SOEs, there are also some limited studies that explore CSR practices at non-SOEs. Kuo et al. (2015), for example, suggested that there were no significant differences between environmental disclosure at SOEs and those at the privately owned enterprises. Based on an evaluation of 781 CSR reports between 2008 and 2010, they found the higher disclosure quality in CO2 and SO2 emission was predominantly because of the government-led national strategy; however, other social activities were better reported by privately owned firms.\n\nFrom the theoretical point of view, signalling theory has been getting attention in corporate disclosure studies in recent years, because it assumes that people send and explain signals to reduce information asymmetry (Lin, 2010). The theory considers that information asymmetry typically exists in a capital market. Under this assumption, information obtained from the management level is considered as much more accurate and reliable than information obtained from the market (Shan and Taylor, 2014). Therefore, investors seek information transparency through corporate sustainability information; without it, they cannot respond quickly to make rational decisions about the most effective investment (Shan and Taylor, 2014). It is also assumed that CSD could lower companies’ capital costs (Li et al., 2013) as well as increase sales (Creyer, 1997), market share and brand value (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2005), because firms with a higher degree of sustainability engagement have.\n\nhigher propensity to outperform the non-sustainability performing firms (Dhaliwal et al., 2011).\n\nCompanies that disclose non-financial information signal their willingness to communicate with their stakeholders about sustainability issues that are unknown by the market (Yang, 2011), and companies produce stand-alone reports when the benefit of providing such disclosure outweighs the related costs. Companies with sound performance will deliver their positive image to the public and be distinguished examples among their peers.\n\nThe users of CSD, in general, include a broad range of company stakeholders, such as socially conscious customers, employees, non-governmental organisations, regulators, investors and financial analysts (Cordeiro and Tewari, 2015). In the context of China, signalling theory is relevant for evaluating the users’ perception of CSD in China because most of the ordinary companies in China have no experience and are not willing to disclose voluntary sustainability information (Shan and Taylor, 2014). However, they have increasingly received significant pressure from the public, the government and industrial associations, to disclose.\n\nFor companies that have produced sustainability reports, and those that plan to do so, it is still not clear which sustainability indicators are considered important to disclose by the report users in China. Only if users perceive a strong and significant relationship between relevant indicators in sustainability reports and long-term corporate performance, they will find the data in the reports as useful. Therefore, understanding users’ perceived importance of CSD is essential.\n\nThis provides motivations to us to assess the level of importance of the CSD in China from the users’ perspective. Considering that GRI guidelines are mostly used in China for sustainability reporting, in this study, we use sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to evaluate users’ perceived importance of each of the indicators. Respondents in this study are asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. The data are accordingly analysed to reflect the users’ perceived level of importance of the corporate environmental, economic and social information disclosures.\n\n# 2.3.2 Chinese report users’ perspective on Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability indicators.\n\nWhile GRI guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reporting, there have been some concerns regarding the potentially different perceptions of the level of importance of the indicators listed on the GRI guidelines. Wang and Juslin (2009), for example, based on their literature study on terms of differences between the West and East contexts, claim that Western corporate sustainability concepts do not adapt well to the Chinese market, because they have rarely defined the primary reason for corporate sustainability. The ethic approach to the corporate sustainability concept does not take the Chinese reality and culture into consideration. They point out that corporate sustainability is a term that may be legitimately interpreted within the Chinese corporate culture. However, Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasise the “cultivation of virtue and morality, as well\n\nas the core of its harmony notion” (Wang and Juslin, 2009, p. 446), offer a better understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context. Accordingly, there may be some of the indicators listed on GRI guidelines that are not relevant within the Chinese context, and hence, they are not considered as necessary by the Chinese report users.

        "text": "# Corporate sustainability disclosure’s importance in China: financial analysts’ perception\n\n# Jhunru Zhang, Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta and Terri Trireksani\n\n# Abstract\n\nPurpose – Corporate sustainability in China has become a subject of increasing international concern. Corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) is considered a useful tool to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of stakeholders in the quest for sustainability. However, the degree of cultural and political influences for being sustainably orientated can be significantly different between countries. This study aims to examine the perception of financial analysts, as CSD report users, in China about the level of importance of various indicators of corporate sustainability described in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – A set of questionnaires was developed based on GRI G4 guidelines to measure the perception of financial analysts in China on the level of importance of each sustainability indicator described in the GRI G4. A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the report users’ perceptions of each of the indicators.\n\nFindings – The findings of this study increase our understanding of how Chinese CSD report users perceive corporate sustainability differently from the GRI guidelines. The main results show that the environmental aspect of sustainability was seen to be important in China, followed by the social and economic aspects. Indicator-wise, “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” were perceived as vital in the environmental category, while “customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” were considered significant in the social category.\n\nOriginality/value – This study addresses the need for differing corporate sustainability guidelines for different nations and cultures, specifically within the Chinese context. It also contributes to the corporate sustainability literature by adding to our understanding of how financial analysts in China, as CSD report users, perceive aspects of sustainability.\n\nKeywords China, Financial analysts, Sustainability, GRI, Corporate sustainability disclosure, Users’ perception\n\nPaper type Research paper\n\nJhunru Zhang and Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta are both based at the School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia.

Introduction\n\nWhile the economic development of China over the preceding decades has led to significant improvement in its national prosperity, it has also generated a considerable degree of concern about corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability disclosures (CSD) are generally considered to be the most effective and efficient way for companies to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of company stakeholders’ quest for sustainability and to inform the society about their sustainability performance (Qian et al., 2015). Because of the lack of comprehensive and effectively enforced CSD regulations, the growth of corporate sustainability practices in China extensively depends on voluntary disclosure practice (Zhang et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, as Received 21 October 2018 Revised 8 July 2019 Accepted 14 July 2019 DOI 10.1108/SRJ-10-2018-0272 © Emerald Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j\n\nRecognised the importance of issuing corporate sustainability reports because of the severe environmental deterioration and significant social issues raised in tandem with the boost of the Chinese economy.\n\nFor example, the serious milk powder corporate scandals in mainland China have raised extreme concern regarding companies’ social responsibility: in 2008, Sanlu Group added melamine into the formula of milk powder to boost the protein content. Infants who consumed this product were highly likely to develop kidney stones or even an illness that was fatal if seriously affected. Sanlu Group was one of the largest milk powder manufacturers and sellers in China for over 15 continuous years, and it was once the biggest taxpayer. The revelation of the scandal caused the failure and bankruptcy of Sanlu, and, more importantly, it destroyed people’s confidence in the Chinese milk powder supply industry. The 300,000 victims triggered considerable social pressure, which consequently affected thousands of workers, causing them to lose their jobs (Nornha et al., 2013). Society, as a result, had to bear this significant social cost.\n\nAs such, the unique context in China provides a significant setting to examine CSD perception from its users’ end. The local Chinese community, in general, has relatively high societal acceptance towards CSD information. Under the Confucius perspective, maximising shareholders’ value and financial profit should not be the only goal of making corporations sustainable (Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009). Xia et al. (2009) emphasised the idea of righteousness before profits and stated that the fundamental value of ethics should reflect the business values. Hence, concerns and actions should always be closely related to all of the customers’, employees’ and shareholders’ values, and sustainability information is in favour for the general community as Confucian culture has been embedded in the basis of modern corporate sustainability in Chinese companies (Zhu and Yao, 2008).\n\nIn addition, Chinese enterprises are increasingly pressured by numerous stakeholders and by the general public to engage in social and environmental sustainability. In particular, in China, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) have made a great effort to promote corporate governance initiatives in past years. Ho (2013) indicates that the rapid growth of these markets is significantly influenced by two essential pieces of legislation: the Company Law and the Securities Law, enacted in 1993 and 1998, respectively. The Company Law provides the legal requirement for the transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private or listed enterprises. To conform to the two legislations, the stock exchanges in China have implemented guidelines for their listed corporations to take responsibility for their stakeholders. The SZSE issued the Corporate Social"

However, the analysis did not find that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Finally, we could show that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.\n\nFollowing legitimacy theory, we conclude that the analyzed banks are rather reactive concerning their sustainability strategy and that they mainly respond to the institutional pressure of Bangladesh Bank because of legitimacy purposes. Instead of integrating sustainability aspects into their core business to decrease risks and to increase the opportunities of green banking, and consequently increase their financial performance, banks rather react in a stakeholder-oriented fashion to keep their legitimacy. Consistent with legitimacy theory, they are biased towards activities favorable to stakeholders instead of a strategic sustainability approach.\n\nThe study contributes to legitimacy theory in sustainable banking and its financial consequences. It demonstrates that increased sustainability performance has a positive effect on the financial performance of banks, as intended by Bangladesh Bank’s ERM, but that this information is not integrated into the banks’ business strategies. Furthermore, the research contributes to legitimacy theory by adding knowledge about the legitimacy-driven behavior of South Asian banks. Moreover, our results contribute to theory by suggesting that legitimacy-driven behavior might not lead to strategic corporate sustainability that addresses the main societal issues in a proactive way.\n\nThe remainder of the paper describes the background literature and the theory, followed by the presentation of the sample and methods. Finally, we report the results of the study and finish with a discussion and conclusions.\n\n# 2. Background\n\nSeveral studies have analyzed financial sustainability regulations and their impact on regulated banks. Most of these studies explore the impact of the Chinese Green Credit Guidelines. Some studies, however, also examine Bangladeshi banks with regard to their sustainability. In general, however, studies on this topic in South Asia are sparse. The following sections present an overview of empirical findings on banks and sustainability, financial sector sustainability regulations and policies, as well as theoretical findings on financial sector sustainability regulations and sustainability in banking.\n\nBanks started integrating non-financial environmental and social aspects into their business during the 1980s. Firstly, they addressed internal environmental management [22], resulting in water, energy, and materials savings, as well as in lower emissions and high reputation [23]. As the second step, banks integrated environmental issues into lending, investing, asset management, and project finance [24]. Hence, they became CSR intermediaries [25] that influence the CSR of their clients, because higher corporate social performance (CSP) mitigates borrowers’ financial risks [26]. Consequently, voluntary sustainability codes of conduct, such as the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative (UNEPFI), the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (UNPRI), and the Equator Principles have been instigated [27].\n\nSustainability risks, such as those caused by climate change or negative environmental impacts of commercial borrowers or investees, have a significant influence on the financial risk of credit and investment portfolios. Consequently, they have to be managed thoroughly [7, 28]. Therefore, many banks have implemented sustainable credit risk assessment procedures [29] and have been using environmental, social, and governance criteria to conduct responsible investments [30 – 32]. Some studies, however, suggest that the sustainability strategies of many banks are not substantially addressing their core business and the main societal issues [33].\n\nFor a long time, the pressure on the financial sector to perform well concerning the sustainability impact of their main products and services, such as lending and investing, has been lower than in many other industries (Weber et al., 2014). Studies have found, however, that environmental and sustainability reporting positively correlates with the size and the profitability of financial institutions [14, 34, 35]. Furthermore, the integration of environmental and sustainability issues into financial sector products and services has been increasing over time and has positive effects on the banks’ financial performance (Scholtens, 2008a).\n\nConsequently, one of the motivations for integrating sustainability into the banking business is the correlation with the financial performance of banks. Igbudu and Garanti [36] suggest that sustainable banking increases the banks’ loyalty and corporate reputation, while a study in Germany identified a strong growth potential for social banking [37] and, therefore, a new market to tap into. Furthermore, studies found a positive connection between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in the banking sector [38, 39], between sustainability, measured by the membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and efficiency [40], as well as between responsible investing and financial returns [41, 42]. However, Climent [43] found that ethical banks are less profitable than their conventional counterparts but that they have more substantial growth in their lending business.\n\nAdditionally, several studies suggest that banks are rather reactive and defensive concerning the incorporation of sustainability aspects into their core businesses [44, 45]. Many of them focus on short-term results and do not integrate sustainability into their core business [46]. The need for a sustainability culture [47] to develop capabilities and to provide resources to improve corporate sustainability performance, however, is not only a phenomenon in the financial industry but in all sectors [48 – 51]. Consequently, financial sector sustainability regulations should take into account that banks might not have the necessary capabilities and resources to implement the regulations efficiently in a way that increases their financial performance.\n\nThough heavily regulated compared with other industrial sectors, the financial sector’s exposure to institutional pressure and regulations addressing sustainability [52], environmental, and societal risks [53, 54] is relatively small. Financial sector regulations focus mainly on risk-adjusted.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999\n\nfinancial capital provisions, financial risks, and guaranteeing the stability of the financial industry. Newer approaches, however, also address the"

        "text": "the corresponding debate in the sustainability literature has remained within an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000). We advance this field of research not only by introducing ambivalent managerial interpretations of sustainability issues but also by elaborating on the cognitive determinants of univalent and ambivalent interpretations. In previous research on the antecedents of managers’ ambivalent interpretation of strategic issues, scholars have focused on organizational factors (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Our cognitive framing perspective adds individual-level factors to the picture. While Barr, Stimpert, and Huff (1992) found that decision makers’ cognitive frames link cues from the organizational context to managerial decision making, we explain how differences in the content and structure of a manager’s frame act at the different stages of the sensemaking process.\n\nAs another important implication, we add to research on the different types of responses managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. In this context, a manager’s sense of control and perception of risk have been discussed as key determinants of the choice of different responses (George et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 1993) and of associated decision-making biases (Das & Teng, 1999; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Our analysis of the effects of differences in frame content and frame structure sheds new light on the sometimes contradictory implications that have resulted from the application of different theoretical lenses to managerial risk and perceptions of control (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; George et al., 2006). We suggest that with different cognitive frames managers’ sense of control over an issue may stem from fundamentally different sources. Likewise, we expect managers to perceive and deal with the riskiness of potential responses differently, depending on which of the two frames they hold. These cognitively determined differences have important implications for managerial decision making on ambiguous sustainability issues. The pragmatic and prudent stances that we expect to be associated with the business case frame and the paradoxical frame, respectively, suggest that commonly used classifications of issue responses along general classifications, such as the reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive (RDAP) scale (Clarkson, 1995; Wartick & Cochran, 1985), may be too simplistic. Managers with a pragmatic stance favor responses of limited scope based on established routines and practices, which considerably limits their proactiveness, yet their propensity to develop workable solutions can potentially bring about large-scale change. Managers with a prudent stance may consider unusual and more radical departures from established routines, yet they are hampered in their ability to implement workable solutions because of their ambivalence and higher awareness of risk and tensions. The often-bemoaned reluctance of firms and their managers to address in a radical fashion the immense challenges that sustainability presents (Whiteman et al., 2013) may thus be rooted in the cognitive predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames. Owing to their pragmatic stance, managers with a business case frame rarely consider deviating from established routines but rely instead on incrementalism; paradoxically minded managers may well see the need to consider bolder responses to sustainability issues but shy away from such endeavors since they are hampered by ambivalence and prudence.\n\nThis argument highlights the need to address the interplay of the two cognitive types, since both business case and paradoxical frames have their role to play in bringing about change but may operate at different stages. Because they go beyond a focus on economic attributes alone, the relatively few managers with a more\n\nparadoxical frame might act as pioneers to pro- propose comprehensive responses that depart from existing routines. However, the translation of these responses into practice may well require managers with a more business case– oriented frame, who are cognitively predisposed to re- ducing the complexity of sustainability issues to a level that enables the implementation of these novel practices at a large scale. Neither of the two frames alone will be sufficient to bring about managerial responses that measure up to the immense challenges sustainability presents.\n\nThe interplay of different cognitive types has various practical and theoretical implications. With regard to managerial practice, in the nascent field of sustainable human resource management (Ehnert, 2009), the composition of teams of different cognitive types may play an important role in the management of sustainability issues. Mirroring findings on the combination of different cognitive styles in the composition of successful innovation teams (Miron-Spektor, Erez, & Naveh, 2011), teams dominated by either business case–minded or paradoxical types may be less successful in implementing innovative responses to sustainability challenges than mixed teams. By avoiding a strong bias in such teams toward one of the two cognitive types, firms can make sure they remain aware of the complexity of sustainability issues (due to the presence of paradoxical types) without losing sight of the need to implement workable solutions (due to the presence of business case types).\n\nOur argument also has theoretical implications for the growing body of literature on hybrid organizations. While this literature conceptualizes conflicting financial and social goals in terms of competing institutional logics (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Pache & Santos, 2013), our focus on the interplay of different cognitive types highlights the relevance of individual-level factors when organizations face competing demands. Our argument suggests that the presence of decision makers who accept competing financial, environmental, and social objectives through paradoxical thinking (Smith, Gonin, & Besharov, 2013) might not be sufficient. Rather, the coexistence and the interplay of different cognitive types, where some are aware of tensions but others are not, appear to play a critical role not only for the management of corporate sustainability in for-profit firms but also for the successful implementation of hybrid business models.\n\nFinally, we believe that addressing a greater cognitive diversity of managers promises considerable further"

These issues should be at the core of sustainable banking in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. However, an earlier study by Khan and Islam [13] suggests a similar result. Hence, it looks like there has not been much change in addressing social sustainability issues. As expected, the Bangladesh ERM did not improve this situation but only influenced the environmental performance of the banks. As Bangladeshi banks seem to have reputational motivations to integrate sustainability into their business, regulations addressing social sustainability might lead to an improvement in this regard.\n\nOverall, it looks like the Bangladeshi banking sector has been increasing its sustainability performance between 2012 and 2016. One reason for this development might be the ERM that has been introduced in 2012. Because of the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance, it not only contributes to improving the industry’s environmental and social performance, but also to its financial performance. This finding is in line with the goals of the ERM and other financial industry sustainability regulations, such as the Chinese Green Credit Policy [7–10]. However, to increase the influence of the banking industry on sustainable development, a more long-term sustainability orientation is needed [92] that is supported by investments in sustainability performance.\n\n# 7. Conclusions\n\nThe results of our study contribute to legitimacy theory by showing that legitimacy is not only a driver for CSR reporting but also for CSR-related activities. The banks in our sample have implemented some sustainability activities because external stakeholders expect this behavior. However, the activities are reactive and not firmly connected to the banks’ businesses. Green financial products and services, for instance, are not growing more than general social and environmental sustainability activities.\n\nOur practical contribution addresses strategic sustainability in banking. The results suggest that banks should not only follow sustainability regulations but that they need to develop a strategy to benefit from the sustainable business approach. With regards to regulators, our results suggest that they should also offer training and tools to enable banks to build the necessary capacity to implement sustainability into their businesses.\n\nOur research was limited with regard to data gathering. We only used publicly available data. Future research might use data from the banks that is gathered through interviews, portfolio analyses, as well as product and services analyses. Furthermore, the impacts of the sustainability performance on the environment and society should be analyzed in future research to explore the sustainability effects of financial sustainability regulations. This analysis should be done from a stakeholder perspective.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, methodology, manuscript writing—review and editing: O.W.; investigation, resources, writing—original draft preparation: R.K.C.
