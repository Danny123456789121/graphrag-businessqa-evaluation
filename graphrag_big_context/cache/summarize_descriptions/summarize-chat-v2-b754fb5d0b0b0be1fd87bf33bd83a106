{"result": "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty designed to combat climate change and limit global warming. It specifically aims to restrict the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with an aspirational target of limiting the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels. The treaty requires participating countries to establish and fulfill their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance efforts to address climate change.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
