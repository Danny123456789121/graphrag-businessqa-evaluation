{"result": "Qualtrics is a software company that specializes in experience management solutions. Previously a subsidiary of SAP SE, Qualtrics was involved in a significant divestiture in June 2023, which had a notable impact on both its financial metrics and SAP's financial statements. This divestiture affected SAP's liquidity and overall financial outlook, as Qualtrics was a formerly reportable segment of SAP that focused on enhancing customer experience management capabilities. Prior to its divestiture, Qualtrics had also acquired Clarabridge in 2021 to bolster its offerings in customer experience management. The divestiture marked a pivotal change for Qualtrics, transitioning it from being part of SAP to operating independently, while also influencing SAP's share-based payment plans and financial reporting.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
