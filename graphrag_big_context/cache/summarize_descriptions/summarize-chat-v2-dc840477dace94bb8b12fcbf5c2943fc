The relationship between GSV and GPPO suggests that sustainable practices not only enhance employees' psychological ownership of green products but also influence how these products are perceived in terms of their environmental friendliness. Specifically, GSV is positively correlated with GPPO, indicating that improvements in green management practices lead to better product performance outcomes. Furthermore, GSV fosters a sense of ownership among employees towards green initiatives, reinforcing the idea that a strong green vision enhances their feelings of ownership over green products.
