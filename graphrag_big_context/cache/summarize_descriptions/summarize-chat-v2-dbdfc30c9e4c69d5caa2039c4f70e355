{"result": "SAP, a global leader in enterprise software, previously owned Qualtrics, a company specializing in experience management. However, SAP divested Qualtrics, which significantly impacted its liquidity and financial outlook. This divestiture led to adjustments in SAP's outlook for continuing operations, as the separation of Qualtrics from its corporate structure affected the company's financial metrics and operational focus. The dissolution of the Qualtrics segment was a notable financial event, as reported in SAP's Integrated Report. Furthermore, the financial implications of Qualtrics's divestiture are relevant to SAP's financial reporting and risk management strategies.
