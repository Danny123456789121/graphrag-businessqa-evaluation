{"result": "CSP refers to multiple interconnected concepts related to corporate responsibility and sustainability. It is primarily recognized as a dummy variable indicating whether a firm is listed at the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA in a given year. Additionally, CSP encompasses the broader notion of Corporate Social Performance, which measures a firm's commitment to social responsibility and ethical behavior in its operations. This includes evaluating how well a company adheres to sustainability practices and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria.\n\nCSP is also associated with the Brazilian Firm ISE, which integrates corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability concerns. The term Corporate Sustainability Performance specifically refers to a company's performance regarding its sustainability practices and corporate social responsibility initiatives. Furthermore, Corporate Sustainability Practices denote the actions and policies that firms implement to address ESG concerns, influenced by various factors such as ownership structure and market conditions.
