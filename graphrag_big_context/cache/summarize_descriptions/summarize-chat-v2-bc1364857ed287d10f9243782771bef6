{"result": "SAP and Qualtrics have a significant historical relationship, as Qualtrics was previously owned by SAP before its divestiture. During this period, Qualtrics was an integral part of SAP's corporate structure. However, SAP considered selling its interest in Qualtrics during a meeting with its Executive Board, which marked the beginning of a strategic shift for the company. Ultimately, SAP proceeded with the divestiture of Qualtrics, effectively separating it from its corporate framework. This decision was part of a broader business strategy that SAP was implementing, indicating a significant change in its operational focus. The financial implications of the Qualtrics divestiture were reported by SAP in its Integrated Report 2023, highlighting the importance of this transition in the company's overall strategy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
