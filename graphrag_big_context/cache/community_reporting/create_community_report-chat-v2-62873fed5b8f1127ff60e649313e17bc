It is designed to align environmental and social aspects with economic objectives, thereby facilitating a comprehensive approach to decision-making. This framework encourages managers to prioritize financial outcomes while also considering social and environmental impacts, aiming to eliminate tensions between these dimensions. By focusing on economic attributes, the Business Case Frame provides strong direction for decision-making in sustainability contexts and influences how decision-makers perceive and prioritize sustainability issues based on their economic implications. Ultimately, it serves as a tool for managers to interpret business-related information and make informed decisions that balance financial performance with sustainable practices.\",5\r\n867,PARADOXICAL FRAME,\"The \"\"PARADOXICAL FRAME\"\" is a cognitive approach that acknowledges and accepts the inherent tensions and conflicts present in various aspects of sustainability issues.
