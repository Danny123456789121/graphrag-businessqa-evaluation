It is also the title of an academic journal dedicated to publishing research and articles on corporate sustainability management, sustainable development, and the market benefits associated with these practices. The journal focuses on a wide range of topics, including green innovation, corporate responsibility, and sustainable organizational practices.\n\nThe term \"\"sustainability\"\" refers to the ability to maintain certain processes or states indefinitely, particularly in the context of corporate practices and environmental responsibility. It emphasizes the importance of balancing ecological and social systems while addressing corporate challenges and decision-making processes related to environmental and social responsibility. Sustainability is fundamentally about meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, which involves careful management of resources and consideration of economic, environmental, and social impacts.\n\nIn summary, sustainability is not only a critical area of research and practice within the journal but also a guiding principle for businesses aiming to conduct operations that are socially and environmentally responsible, ultimately striving for long-term benefits for society as a whole.\",41\r\n861,MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING,\"Managerial decision making encompasses the cognitive processes that managers employ to make strategic decisions, drawing upon their interpretations of various signals and information. This process includes the critical activities of scanning, interpreting, and responding to information, with a particular emphasis on sustainability issues. Through these processes, managers navigate complex environments to arrive at informed decisions that align with both organizational goals and broader sustainability considerations.\",12\r\n594,INDIA,\"India is a country located in South Asia, characterized by a public sector banking system that has been evaluated for its readiness in sustainable development. The public sector banking industry in India addresses sustainability regulations, albeit in a defensive manner.

It is designed to align environmental and social aspects with economic objectives, thereby facilitating a comprehensive approach to decision-making. This framework encourages managers to prioritize financial outcomes while also considering social and environmental impacts, aiming to eliminate tensions between these dimensions. By focusing on economic attributes, the Business Case Frame provides strong direction for decision-making in sustainability contexts and influences how decision-makers perceive and prioritize sustainability issues based on their economic implications. Ultimately, it serves as a tool for managers to interpret business-related information and make informed decisions that balance financial performance with sustainable practices.\",5\r\n867,PARADOXICAL FRAME,\"The \"\"PARADOXICAL FRAME\"\" is a cognitive approach that acknowledges and accepts the inherent tensions and conflicts present in various aspects of sustainability issues. It serves as a conceptualization that recognizes the complexity and contradictory nature of economic, environmental, and social concerns, significantly influencing decision-making processes. This framework allows managers and decision-makers to integrate and accommodate conflicting yet interrelated sustainability issues rather than attempting to eliminate them. By embracing this paradoxical perspective, decision-makers can consider a broader range of sustainability challenges, leading to a more nuanced understanding and navigation of the complexities involved. Ultimately, the paradoxical frame enhances the ability to address the multifaceted nature of sustainability by incorporating diverse attributes, which contributes to a higher level of complexity in decision-making.\",5\r\n24,STAKEHOLDERS,\"Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have a vested interest in the decisions and activities of an organization.
