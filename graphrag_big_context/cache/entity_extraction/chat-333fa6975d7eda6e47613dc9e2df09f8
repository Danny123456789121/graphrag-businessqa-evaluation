The medium-term prospects for economic growth are lower than they have been for decades. After a strong start to 2023, the global economy showed a significant slowdown over the summer. This was mainly due to weak industrial production and the sharp rise in interest rates in most regions of the world. Another dampening factor was the subdued development in China. The economic situation is assessed very similarly by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Inflation, however, has fallen from last year’s multiyear high. The IMF expects inflation rates to fall from 6.9% in 2023 to 5.8% in 2024, with most countries not coming close to their central banks’ targets before 2025. The OECD expects an average inflation rate of at least 2% in 2024 for both the United States and the euro area and is even forecasting 2.1% for Japan.\n\n# Stock Markets Stimulated by Falling Interest Rates\n\nThe stock market year 2023 was nevertheless more successful than many had expected in advance: The German blue-chip index DAX ended the year with a rise of over 19% and most stock markets worldwide were also up. The recent slowdown in inflation raised hopes of a looser monetary policy, which had a price-driving effect. The S&P500 index rose 22.8% and the Nasdaq-100 technology index exceeded all expectations with a gain of 53.8%.\n\n# SAP Stock Reaches New All-Time High\n\nThe SAP share price continued to improve throughout 2023. Shortly after SAP announced its good results for financial year 2022 at the end of January, the SAP share price rose more than 7% in a single week to €112.58. The successful execution of SAP’s cloud transformation and the resulting improvement in profitability sent clear signals to the market.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
