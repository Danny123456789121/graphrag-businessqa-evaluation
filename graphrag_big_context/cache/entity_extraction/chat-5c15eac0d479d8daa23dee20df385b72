Nearly two-thirds of respondents to our survey report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double what our previous survey found just ten months ago, and four in ten are using gen AI in more than two business functions. The technology’s potential is no longer in question. And while most organizations are still in the early stages of their journeys with gen AI, we are beginning to get a picture of what works and what doesn’t in implementing—and generating actual value with—the technology.\n\nOne thing we’ve learned: the business goal must be paramount. In our work with clients, we ask them to identify their most promising business opportunities and strategies and then work backward to potential gen AI applications. Leaders must avoid the trap of pursuing tech for tech’s sake. The greatest rewards also will go to those who are not afraid to think big. As we’ve observed, the leading companies are the ones that are focusing on reimagining entire workflows with gen AI and analytical AI rather than simply seeking to embed these tools into their current ways of working.\n\nFor that to be effective, leaders must be ready to manage change at every step along the way. And they should expect that change to be constant: enterprises will need to design a gen AI stack that is robust, cost-efficient, and scalable for years to come. They’ll also need to draw on leaders from throughout the organization. Realizing profit-and-loss impact from gen AI requires close partnership with HR, finance, legal, and risk to constantly readjust the resourcing strategies and productivity expectations.\n\n# Inaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\n\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they’re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use. Respondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).\n\nConversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them. In fact, inaccuracy—which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content—is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\n# Exhibit 7\n\nInaccuracy and intellectual property infringement are increasingly considered relevant risks to organizations’ generative AI use.\n\n# Gen AI risks that organizations consider relevant, 1 % of respondents\n\n|Inaccuracy|Cybersecurity|Regulatory compliance|Equity and fairness|Organizational reputation|Environmental impact|Physical safety|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|63|56\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
