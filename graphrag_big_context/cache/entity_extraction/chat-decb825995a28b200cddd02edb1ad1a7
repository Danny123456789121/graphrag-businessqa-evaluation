The highest number of correlations was observed between the strategic and psychological aspects, and the least—between the strategic and environmental ones.\n\n# 3.2.1. The Strategic Aspect and the Social Aspect\n\nStrong correlations were observed between strategic statements 2 and 5 (“HR has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan”; “I think my organization could be a model for other organizations when it comes to promoting sustainability activities”) and social statements 1 and 2 (actions for older workers and different age groups), as well as between strategic statement 4 (“I see benefits for the company from taking initiatives for sustainability”) and the social statement 1. The other observed correlations are moderate.\n\n# 3.2.2. The Strategic Aspect and the Psychological Aspect\n\nCorrelations exist between most of the statements that make up both the strategic and psychological aspects. A strong positive relationship was observed between statements 4–6 of the strategic aspect (noticing the benefits of taking actions for sustainability, the organization can be a model in this field, an opportunity for the HR department to raise its strategic position) and the psychological statement 1 (treating employees as a key resource in the organization), between strategic statements 4 and 6 and psychological statement 5 (covering the costs of training by the company) and between strategic statements 5 and 6 and psychological statements 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in sustainable development behaviour). The remaining observed correlations are of moderate strength.\n\n# 3.2.3. The Strategic Aspect and the Ecological Aspect\n\nOut of the 6 statements that make up the strategic aspect, only 3 correlate with selected statements that make up the ecological aspect. The strength of the correlation is weak to moderate. Strategic statement 1 (involvement of the HR department in creating sustainable development policy) is correlated with statements 1–3 and 5–6 that make up the ecological aspect. Strategic statement 2 (introducing sustainability into a company’s action plan) correlates with environmental statements 1–4, and strategic statement 5 (organization as a model for promoting sustainability activities) with environmental statements 1 and 2.\n\nSummarizing the analysis of the correlation between the strategic aspect of Sustainable HRM and the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, one can observe an emerging tendency that correlations occur more often and with greater power between these variants of answers, constituting particular aspects in which enterprises take specific actions, which confirms the usefulness of the adopted research model.\n\n# 3.3. Multiple Regression of the Strategic Aspect in Relation to the Social, Psychological, and Ecological Aspects\n\nIn order to establish the relationship between the variables forming the individual Sustainable HRM dimensions, regression models were constructed. Six regression models, in which the dependent variables were individual questions concerning the strategic aspect, while the independent variables were questions concerning the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, were examined. Regression models for dependent variables strategic (i − 1,..., 6) are described by the equation:\n\nSTi = α0 +∑αj ∗ SOj +∑αj+6 ∗ Pj +∑αj+12 ∗ Ej\n\nwhere ST—Strategic; SO—Social; P—Psychological; E—Ecological.\n\nThe normality of the rest of the regression model was checked in each case. Based on the scattering plots of the model residuals with respect to the predicted residuals, it was concluded that the residuals were homoscedastic and non-correlated, and the existence of outliers in the model was checked on the basis of Cook’s distance. Analysis of the PLOTS of predicted residual values for all models showed that they are constructed correctly. The residuals in the model have normal distributions, and residual homoscedasticity is present. Cook’s distance analysis also shows that there are no outliers in the individual models.\n\nThe only significant variable that influences the Strategic Aspect 1 is the Psychological 3 aspect of providing employees with coaching. R2 in the model is 0.55, and the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is 0.00011.\n\nThe Strategic aspect 2 is influenced by the Social aspect 1. The Fisher test shows that the model is statistically significant, with p-value 0.00011 and R2 for the model 0.55.\n\nThe factor with a statistically significant impact on the Strategic aspect 3 is the Ecological aspect 3. The model as a whole is statistically significant, as evidenced by the p-value in the Fisher test p = 0.0052. R2 in the model is 0.45.\n\nIn model 4, the factors significantly influencing the Strategic 4 variable are the Psychological 1, Psychological 4, Psychological 5, and Ecological 1 aspects, where the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is p < 0.0000 and R2 is 0.69.\n\nIn the regression model 5, the Strategic 5 variable is significantly influenced by Social 1 and Psychological 6 aspects. R2 in the model is 0.61, while the p-value in the model significance test is 0.0001.\n\nIn the last constructed regression model, the Strategic 6 variable is significantly influenced by the Psychological 1 and Psychological 4 variables. R2 in the model is 0.57, while the p-value in the Fisher significance test is 0.0003.\n\nTo\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
