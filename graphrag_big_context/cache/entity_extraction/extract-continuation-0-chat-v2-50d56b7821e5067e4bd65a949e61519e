We increased short-term time deposits and debt instruments by €2.5 billion. We paid, net of cash received, a total of €1.2 billion mainly for the LeanIX acquisition in 2023, compared to €0.7 billion mainly for the Taulia and Askdata acquisitions in 2022. We received, net of taxes paid, approximately €5.5 billion for the divestiture of Qualtrics in 2023. Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment decreased to €0.8 billion (€0.9 billion in 2022). For more information about current and planned capital expenditures, see the Assets section and the Investment Goals section.\n\nIn 2023, free cash flow (for the definition, see the Performance Management System section) increased to €5,093 million (2022: €4,388 million). The free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow as a percentage of profit after tax, decreased to 141% (2022: 143%).\n\nNet cash outflows from financing activities were €7,758 million in 2023, compared to €6,074 million in 2022. The buyback of treasury shares with a volume of €0.95 billion in 2023 is included herein. Apart from the buyback of treasury shares, cash outflows in 2023 resulted from the repayment of €1.6 billion in Eurobonds, €1.45 billion in loans, and €0.93 billion in commercial paper when they matured. In 2022, we bought back treasury shares with a volume of €1.5 billion. Further cash outflows in 2022 resulted from the repayment of €0.9 billion in Eurobonds and US$0.445 billion in U.S. private placements when they matured.\n\nThe dividend payment made in 2023 was €2,395 million compared to €2,865 million paid the preceding year.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Assets (IFRS)\n\n# Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n\nTotal assets decreased 5% year over year to €68,335 million.\n\n|Assets|Percent|\n|---|---|\n|Non-current|70|\n|Current|30|\n|2022|74|\n|2022|26|\n\nTotal current assets increased 11% in 2023 from €18,522 million to €20,571 million, mainly driven by an increase in time deposits in other financial assets.\n\nTotal non-current assets decreased 11% to €47,764 million (2022: €53,638 million).
