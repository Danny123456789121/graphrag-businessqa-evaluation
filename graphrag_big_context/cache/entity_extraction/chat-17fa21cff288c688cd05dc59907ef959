And among water-cooling solutions, evaporative cooling—in which water absorbs ambient heat through evaporation—is frequently both the cheapest and the most energy efficient. Google found that its water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy than its air-cooled data centers. 35 But water cooling has the potential to exacerbate pressure on water resources in specific locations. A Virginia Tech study estimates that one-fifth of US data centers (primarily located in Western states) draw their water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds. 36\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Exhibit 5 - Critical choices can shape AI’s emissions footprint\n\n|Factor and Baseline Metric|Reduced emissions|Increased emissions|\n|---|---|---|\n|AI adoption & usage|–100%|Unknown|\n|Baseline: Current AI compute consumption| | |\n|Model development & coding|–80%|90%|\n|Baseline: Transformer (2017)| | |\n| |Evolved (2019) and Primer (2021) models| |\n|Data center infrastructure (servers)|–93%|–23%|\n|Baseline: Unoptimized systems energy use|(P100 from 2017)| |\n| |ML-oriented1|ML-oriented1|\n| |(TPU v4, 2021)|(TPU v2, 2019)|\n|Data center infrastructure (non-IT equipment)|–30%|50%|\n|Baseline: Traditional data center energy needs| | |\n| |Cloud data centers| |\n|Energy source carbon intensity3|–94%|–77%|\n| |–22%–16%|+12%|\n| | |+60%|\n|Baseline: Global grid emission intensity in 2022| | |\n| |Norway|Brazil|\n| |FLAP-D4US|Singapore|\n| |South Africa| |\n\nNote: The figure is based on the most recent data available on actual emissions profiles for different choices—and is not intended to suggest that these factors are equally important.\n\n1Patterson, D. et al., 2021. Carbon Emissions and Large Neural Network Training.\n\n2Patterson, D. et al., 2022. The carbon footprint of machine learning training will plateau, then shrink.\n\n3Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\n4Europe Data Centers main locations: Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin.\n\nIn the data center sector, water use is not widely reported—and actual volumes will vary widely based on the center’s size, location, local weather conditions, and the use of its infrastructure. A 2016 study from the US Department of Energy estimates data center water consumption at 1.7 billion liters/day, of which 0.3 billion liters/day is used on site for cooling, or 0.02% of total US water consumption of 1,218 billion liters/day.\n\nClearly, data center operators need to be mindful of and manage a tradeoff between energy use and water use. Google began disclosing water use for each of its owned US data center locations in 2021 and for global owned data center locations in 2022. A Google analysis of the 2021 data finds that its embrace of water cooling across its data centers reduced its carbon emissions by roughly 300 kilotons—the emissions equivalent of about 64,000 passenger vehicles. The 5.2 billion gallons of water required to do that in 2022 was comparable to the water needed to irrigate 34.8 of the more than 11,000 golf courses in the United States or the annual water consumption of 69,800 average American homes.\n\nTech players are also starting to explore new, more water-efficient approaches. In a data center, temperature, airflow, and relative humidity (RH) are the three critical factors to manage. Based on guidance from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Meta has experimented with shifting the lower-bound for RH in its data center from 20% to 13%. The nine-month pilot yielded water savings of 40%.\n\nData center operators are also taking steps to replenish their water consumption. Google, for example, has a target to replenish 120% of the freshwater volume it consumes on average by 2030 through initiatives including wetland restoration, rainwater harvesting, and land conservation.\n\n# Issue 3: Waste\n\nThe United Nations estimates that globally 53.6 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated in 2019. This figure represents a 21% increase in just five years. And the volume is projected to increase to 74.7 million metric tons by 2030—representing a near doubling of e-waste over a 20-year period.\n\nWhile there is currently a lack of specific data regarding e-waste generated by data centers, they clearly only account for a fraction of the broader e-waste challenge. Nonetheless, there is a clear imperative for tech firms to take a smarter, more circular approach to waste.\n\nCircular economy principles emphasize the opportunity to maximize the lifespan of products and materials through practices such as reuse and recycling. For tech companies, this entails designing products and data center infrastructure with an eye toward longevity and ease of upgrading or repurposing. Moreover, it involves establishing efficient systems for recycling and refurbishing electronic equipment, ensuring that valuable materials are reclaimed and that hazardous substances are disposed of responsibly.\n\nMicrosoft’s Circular Centers, for example, focus on finding productive uses for decommissioned equipment, including new homes for older equipment, such as in schools. They break servers down into components that can be reused by others, and return other items to suppliers for recycling and reclamation. The first of these centers opened in 2020 in Amsterdam and has been able to channel 83% of e-waste into reuse—and 17% into recycling.
