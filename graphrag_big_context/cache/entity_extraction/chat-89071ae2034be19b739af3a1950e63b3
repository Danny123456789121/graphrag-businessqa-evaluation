We consider such assets to be in default if they are significantly beyond their due date or if the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligation. A write-off occurs when the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, for example when bankruptcy proceedings have been finalized or when all enforcement efforts have been exhausted.\n\n# Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities include bank loans, issued bonds, private placements, and other financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities also include customer funding liabilities which are funds we draw from and make payments on behalf of our customers for customers’ employee expense.\n\n212/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nReimbursements, related credit card payments, and vendor payments. We present these funds in cash and cash equivalents and record our obligation to make these expense reimbursements and payments on behalf of our customers as customer funding liabilities. As we do not designate financial liabilities as FVTPL, we generally classify non-derivative financial liabilities as AC. Expenses and gains or losses on financial liabilities at AC mainly consist of interest expense which is shown in Financial income, net. Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net.\n\n# Group Liquidity, Financial Debt, and Net Debt\n\nGroup liquidity consists of cash at banks, money market and other funds, as well as time deposits and debt securities (both with remaining maturities of less than one year). Financial debt is defined as the nominal volume of bank loans, issued commercial papers, private placements, and bonds. Net debt is group liquidity less financial debt.\n\n# Group Liquidity and Net Debt\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|∆|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Cash and cash equivalents|8,124|9,008|–883|\n|Current time deposits and debt securities|3,151|686|2,464|\n|Group liquidity|11,275|9,694|1,581|\n|Current financial debt|–1,143|–3,986|2,843|\n|Non-current financial debt|–6,612|–7,778|1,166|\n|Financial debt|–7,755|–11,764|4,009|\n|Net debt (–)|3,521|–2,070|5,590|\n\nWhile we continuously monitor the ratios presented in the capital structure table, we actively manage our liquidity and structure of our financial indebtedness based on the ratios group liquidity and net debt.\n\n# Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n|€ millions|Current|Non-Current|Total|Current|Non-Current|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cash at banks|3,369|0|3,369|3,176|0|3,176|\n|Time deposits|2,130|0|2,130|2,932|0|2,932|\n|Money market and other funds|2,478|0|2,478|2,855|0|2,855|\n|Debt securities|150|0|150|47|0|47|\n|Expected credit loss allowance|–3|0|–3|–3|0|–3|\n|Cash and cash equivalents|8,124|0|8,124|9,008|0|9,008|\n\n213/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Non-Derivative Financial Debt Investments\n\n|€ millions|Current|Non-Current|Total|Current|Non-Current|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Time deposits|3,028|0|3,028|657|0|657|\n|Debt securities|129|0|129|32|0|32|\n|Financial instruments related to employee benefit plans|0|244|244|0|203|203|\n|Loans and other financial receivables|108|192|300|104|129|233|\n|Expected credit loss allowance|–7|0|–7|–3|0|–3|\n|Non-derivative financial debt investments|3,259|436|3,695|790|332|1,122|\n|Other financial assets|3,344|5,543|8,887|853|5,626|6,479|\n|Non-derivative financial debt investments as % of Other financial assets|97|8|42|93|6|17|\n\nTime deposits with original maturity of three months or less are presented as cash and cash equivalents, and those with original maturities of greater than three months (investments considered in group liquidity) are presented as other financial assets. Debt securities consist of acquired commercial papers and acquired bonds of mainly financial and non-financial corporations and municipalities. The increase in time deposits presented as cash equivalents and current investments and the increase in money market funds in 2023 are due to the proceeds from the Qualtrics divestiture.\n\nFor more information about financial risk and the nature of risk, see Note (F.1).\n\n# Financial Debt\n\n|€ millions|Nominal Volume|Carrying Amount|Nominal Volume|Carrying Amount|Total|Current|Non-Current|Current|Non-Current|Total|\n|\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
