Riverine floods offer an example. Extreme rains take time to flow down river and that time can be put to good use taking action to mitigate their impact on communities along the banks. Flood Hub, an initiative of Google Research, enables governments, aid organizations, and individuals to take timely action and prepare for riverine floods via locally relevant flood data and forecasts up to seven days in advance. (See the sidebar Providing Early Warning of Rising River Levels with Flood Hub.)\n\n# Building Resilient Infrastructure and Protecting Biodiversity\n\nAI can also support risk assessment and remediation planning for critical infrastructure, helping localities model vulnerabilities, prioritize resilience-building investments, and pressure-test plans. In India, Google is helping the government address food and water security challenges by interpreting satellite data to track farm boundaries, measure forest and woodland acreage, and identify improvements to irrigation structures to prepare for droughts.\n\n15 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Providing Early Warning of Rising River Levels with Flood Hub\n\nAnnually, floods cause thousands of fatalities worldwide, disrupt the lives of millions, and lead to significant financial costs. They are one of the deadliest natural disasters, and climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.\n\nBetter prediction of impending flooding has the potential to save lives and mitigate the extent of property damage. Flood Hub—powered by AI models developed by Google Research—aims to predict when and where riverine flooding will occur in order to provide timely warnings to governments, organizations, and the people likely to be affected, empowering them to act before the flood strikes.\n\nReal-time flood forecasts and visualizations are available on the Flood Hub platform and, in many cases, also on Search and Maps. As of 2023, Flood Hub covers more than 80 countries, providing forecasts up to seven days in advance. It offers alerts for geographies across Africa, Europe, South and Central America, and the Asia-Pacific region that combined are home to 460 million people. In October 2023, Flood Hub expanded to the US and Canada, covering more than 800 riverbanks where over 12 million people live. The goal is to bring flood forecasting to every country and to include more types of floods through ongoing collaborations with governments, communities, academics, and organizations such as the World Meteorological Organization.\n\n# Application area: Early Warning Systems\n\nFlood Hub’s heat map of flood risk\n\nSource: Google. Used with permission.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Helping UNHCR Get Ahead of Forced Displacement in Somalia\n\nMillions of people in Somalia face displacement as a consequence of climate-driven natural disasters, resource shortages, and violent conflict. In 2022 alone, climate-driven events—drought, floods, wildfires, and storms—displaced 1.2 million Somalis, representing nearly two-thirds of all internal displacements for the year. On point to support those refugees, UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, wanted a better way to forecast where and when to deploy its resources.\n\nIt partnered with Omdena, a global, crowdsourced community of AI experts, to develop AI solutions that could predict displacement a month in advance. Omdena developed machine learning models that helped predict areas for intervention based on identified conflict “hot zones” combined with drought and agricultural production metrics. The insights from these models are enabling UNHCR to optimize the assignments of its personnel and deployment of resources.\n\n# Application area: Adaptation and Resilience\n\n17\n\n# ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\nMoreover, AI can help people understand and mitigate the impacts of a warming planet on agriculture, fisheries, and the broader natural world. In agriculture, it can control intelligent irrigation systems, identify early signs of crop diseases, predict future yields based on current trends, and promote knowledge transfer across biomes. It can also help protect wilder places. Global Forest Watch, for example, uses AI and satellite imagery to create a real-time tool to monitor and combat deforestation.\n\n# AI’s Foundational Capabilities to Support Climate Action\n\nAI can also help turbocharge foundational capabilities that are essential to shaping an effective response to the climate crisis.\n\n# Climate Modeling\n\nAI can strengthen climate models by filling in data gaps, enabling the incorporation of additional variables, and navigating data sets too large for human analysis. It can also yield more accurate estimates by modeling multidimensional complex systems and the feedback loops among, for example, climate and socioeconomic variables. The greater accuracy and precision of the AI models in turn enhances the impact of AI-supported climate applications.\n\n# Climate Economics\n\nAI can improve estimates of the financial implications of climate-related impacts and response measures, enabling policymakers and private-sector leaders to better understand which investments today are likely to yield the greatest benefit. For example, government leaders in Lagos, Nigeria—one of the African continent’s most vulnerable cities—leveraged AI to model the potential financial and socioeconomic impacts of rising sea levels and evaluate those investments with the highest impact on adaptation and resilience. (See the sidebar Helping Lagos Shape Its Strategy for Climate-related Adaptation and Resilience.) Another example is Sprout, an insurtech startup that provides coffee farmers with crop insurance based on weather fluctuations. (See the sidebar Sprout: Helping Smallholder Coffee Farmers Navigate Climate Change.)\n\n# Education and Behavioral Change\n\nAI can help influence climate-friendly behavior. After all, people may wish to make climate-friendly choices but lack the information to know, for example, the relative carbon footprint of two pairs of jeans. By providing relevant information, AI can help consumers make environmentally conscious choices. For example, Google Maps uses AI to suggest fuel-efficient routes that have fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA. The feature is available in the US, Canada, Europe, and Egypt and will\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FLOOD HUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flood Hub is an initiative of Google Research that provides timely flood data and forecasts to help governments and communities prepare for riverine floods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a multinational technology company that develops AI models and initiatives like Flood Hub to address various global challenges, including climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNHCR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the UN agency responsible for aiding and protecting refugees and displaced persons worldwide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OMDENA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Omdena is a global community of AI experts that collaborates to develop AI solutions for social impact, including predicting displacement in Somalia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOMALIA<|>GEO<|>Somalia is a country facing significant challenges due to climate-driven natural disasters, resource shortages, and violent conflict, leading to widespread displacement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGOS<|>GEO<|>Lagos is a city in Nigeria that is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels, and is using AI to model financial and socioeconomic impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston Consulting Group is a global management consulting firm that collaborates with organizations like Google on initiatives related to climate action.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>EVENT<|>AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that are being utilized to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOOD HUB<|>GOOGLE<|>Flood Hub is an initiative developed by Google Research to provide flood forecasts and data to mitigate the impact of flooding<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNHCR<|>OMDENA<|>UNHCR partnered with Omdena to develop AI solutions for predicting displacement in Somalia<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOMALIA<|>UNHCR<|>Somalia is the country where UNHCR is focusing its efforts to assist displaced persons due to climate-driven disasters<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGOS<|>GOOGLE<|>Lagos is leveraging AI technologies developed by organizations like Google to model climate-related impacts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOOD HUB<|>SOMALIA<|>Flood Hub's predictive capabilities can be beneficial for regions like Somalia that are affected by flooding<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI<|>FLOOD HUB<|>AI technologies are utilized in Flood Hub to enhance flood prediction and response capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI<|>UNHCR<|>AI is being used by UNHCR to predict displacement and optimize resource deployment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>Google collaborates with Boston Consulting Group on initiatives related to climate action and AI<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
