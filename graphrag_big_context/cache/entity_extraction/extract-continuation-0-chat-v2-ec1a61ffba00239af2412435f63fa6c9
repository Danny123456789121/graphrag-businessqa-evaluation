In our pursuit of this vision, we focus on three areas:\n\n# Agility at Scale\n\nIn a rapidly changing landscape, the need for business agility is paramount to maintaining competitiveness. We facilitate this through data insights that help organizations adapt to market conditions. Our cloud ERP solutions and SAP Business AI capabilities are integrated, providing agility and empowering organizations to pivot, whether to strategic shifts or unexpected market scenarios.\n\n# Achieve More Across the Value Chain\n\nWe help organizations leverage the collective intelligence that SAP provides to optimize performance across their value chain. By connecting core processes – from finance to supply chains and human resources to customer relations – we support efficient growth throughout businesses. Our solutions go beyond internal systems, linking businesses across enterprises and digitalizing transactions to foster transparent, resilient, and sustainable value chains.\n\n# Sustainability at Your Core\n\nWe have evolved beyond mere sustainability aspirations to actionable, sustainable outcomes. SAP’s green ledger initiative provides auditable sustainability practices as an extension of business operations. This approach enables organizations to record real impacts, report audit-ready ESG metrics, and act with ESG principles integrated into business processes, supporting data-driven sustainability management.\n\nAt SAP, our journey is one of continuous innovation and transformation, and we are committed to delivering solutions that are not only relevant and reliable but also responsible.\n\n# Our Business Model\n\nOur business model, through which we implement our vision and strategy, can be summarized as follows:\n\nWe create value by first identifying the business needs of our customers and then developing and delivering cloud solutions, software, services, and support that address these needs. By proactively obtaining customer feedback on a regular basis, we strive to continuously improve our solutions, identify further business needs, and deliver enhanced value to our customers across the entire lifecycle – and thus continually improve the customer experience.\n\nWe derive revenue from fees charged to our customers for subscriptions to use our cloud solutions. Software licenses, on-premise support, consulting, development, training, and other services also contribute significant revenue.\n\nFor an overview of our product portfolio, see the Our Product Strategy section.\n\n# Subsidiaries, Acquisitions, and Joint Ventures\n\n# Subsidiaries\n\nSAP SE is the parent company of the SAP Group.
