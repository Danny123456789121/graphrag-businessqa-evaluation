The results suggest that CSD report users in China perceived these five indicators more important than what were intended by the GRI. The t-test for the other seven indicators shows no significant results. For “effluents and waste”, “emissions” and “compliance”, the perceptions of the respondents were consistent with the recent trend of carbon offsets and carbon emissions.\n\n# Table III\n\nMean value and t-test for environmental indicators (sample size N = 129, scale value 1-5)\n\n| |Mean|Std deviation|t|Sig|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Water|4.51|0.626|9.276|0.000|\n|Effluents and waste|4.48|0.651|8.389|0.000|\n|Emissions|4.46|0.718|7.233|0.000|\n|Compliance|4.35|0.669|5.922|0.000|\n|Energy|4.20|0.722|3.170|0.002|\n|Supplier environmental assessment|4.10|0.759|1.509|0.134|\n|Material usage|4.10|0.769|1.488|0.139|\n|Biodiversity|4.09|0.820|1.181|0.240|\n|Environmental overall sustainability|4.07|0.731|1.084|0.280|\n|Products and services|4.06|0.647|1.089|0.278|\n|Environmental grievance|4.04|0.861|0.512|0.610|\n|Transportation|3.91|0.861|1.227|0.222|\n\nNotes: t-test at 95% confidence interval; significant at 0.01 level\n\nin many major cities in China, which has gradually gained significant international attention. Carbon offset refers to a monetary investment that abates greenhouse gas emission or sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, which is used to compensate for greenhouse gas emission from companies’ own activities. To combat severe air pollution, Beijing, for example, has had “APEC-blue” sky, because the government temporarily shut down the industrial area in Hebei. The overall mean value for environmental indicators is 4.20 (out of 5). Hence, H1A was supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2A.\n\n# 4.3 Perceived importance of the economic indicators\n\nTable IV presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for economic indicators, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “indirect economic impacts” and “procurement practices” are found to be statistically significant at the 0.01 level, while “market presence” is found to be significant at the 0.05 level. The t-test for “economic performance” shows no significant result. Interestingly, the mean values for all four indicators are below the test value of 4, suggesting that all economic indicators were not perceived to be as important as they were intended to be in the GRI guidelines. The overall mean value for economic indicators is 3.79 (out of 5). Hence, both H1B and H2B were not supported.\n\n# 4.4 Perceived importance of the social indicators\n\n# 4.4.1 Social indicators – labour practice and decent work.\n\nTable V presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of labour practice and decent work, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “Occupational health and safety” is found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level and it has a mean value of 4.22, indicating that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI.
