They advocate that such commitment is able to foster the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm’s performance.\n\nIn fact, prior research on the relationship between CSP and firm profitability has seen it as dynamic with results revealing profitability as a determinant of CSP and also the opposite (Garcia-Castro et al., 2010; McGuirre et al., 1988). Thus, firm’s perspective is expanded by integrating an ethical and responsible conduct (Harrison et al., 2010). Such ethical conduct has been seen as able to improve firm’s image and create value in the mid- and long-run by promoting a virtuous cycle between firm and its stakeholders, favoring firm’s market share and competitive advantage (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).\n\nThe argument about the effect of profitability on sustainability is associated with the fact that firms with higher profitability, under the financial slack resources theoretical framework, tend to have more funds available to undertake social and environmental actions (Husted and Salazar, 2006; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Following this argument, it seems appropriate to hypothesize that profitability contributes to higher CSP:\n\n# H3.\n\nProfitability has a positive effect on CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\n\nFirm size has often been suggested as able to moderate firm social and sustainability policies and, indeed, it has been used as an important control variable in this context, although the arguments about the possible effect of firm size on these policies are still controversial (Baumann-Pauly et al., 2013; Orlitzky, 2001; Udayasankar, 2008). It is postulated that larger firms are able to provide more resources to support firm’s social and sustainability policy. Additionally, as the firm becomes larger, it interacts with a wider scope of stakeholders and, this way, experiences greater appeal for ESG concerns. In this vein, such concerns tend to be more relevant to larger firms which are more compelled to follow ethical behavior and integrate better corporate governance practices (Ullman, 1985; Ziegler and Schro¨ der, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013). Following this rationale, we propose that larger firms are more prone to be committed with sustainability issues as summarized in the following hypothesis:\n\n# Larger firms are more likely to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\n\nThere are arguments suggesting that innovation process, which is closely related to growth opportunities, is positive to the firm production system by making it more effective, given that innovation leads to optimizing the consumption of energy and natural resources, and thus reducing its effect on the natural environment. This may lead to better corporate sustainability related to products and processes (Padgett and Galan, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Artiach et al., 2010). Besides, firm’s growth opportunities have been considered to be related to firm’s commitment to sustainability given that the firm needs to signal to the market that it is sustainable to be able to access external funds to seize its growth opportunities. Thus, to better maximize its growth opportunities, which is closely related to innovation process that is beneficial to firm’s sustainability, the firm needs to show that it is committed to sustainability in terms of natural environment concerns, stakeholder management and business ethics, which involves good standards of corporate governance, adequate relations with clients and supply chain and natural environment concerns. This rationale motivates the following hypothesis:\n\n# H5. Growth opportunities have a positive influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\n\nCreditors are usually effective in pressing for the meeting of their demands, as they finance firm’s investment and need guarantees for the return of their funds. This situation sometimes leads to firm monitoring if the firm increases its indebtedness (Artiach et al., 2010). Thus, in low leveraged firms, creditors exert less pressure over their rights. On the other hand, more indebted firms are more committed to creditor rights. The financial obligations with creditors may lead to reduced slack resources and to lower firm’s capacity to undertake social and sustainability actions which require available funds, constraining the firm to direct funds to CSR activities (Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). These arguments lead to the hypothesis proposal that debt may inhibit firm sustainability policy as follows:\n\n# H6. Debt has a negative influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.\n\n# 3. Empirical research\n\n# 3.1 Sample\n\nThe sample is composed of 2,685 firm-year observations from 327 firms, covering the period of 2006-2015. The year 2006 corresponds to the first year of the Brazilian Firm ISE. Firms financial and ownership data were obtained from Economatica database. Every firm’s sector was checked in Law 10.165/2000 to categorize each one according to the industry environmental risk. The status of composing the annual ISE, that is the proxy for higher CSP, was collected at the ISE website at BM&FBOVESPA. The sample period is also relevant given that it allows assessing the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and eventual recovery in the aftermath. The whole sample of firms is distributed among several sectors of the economy (Table I). As can be observed in Table I, membership to the ISE seems to attract firms from all industries.
