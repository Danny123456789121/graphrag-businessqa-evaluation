Generative AI’s natural-language capabilities increase the automation potential of these types of activities somewhat. But its impact on more physical work activities shifted much less, which isn’t surprising because its capabilities are fundamentally engineered to do cognitive tasks.\n\nAs a result, generative AI is likely to have the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation (Exhibit 10). Our estimate of the technical potential to automate the application of expertise jumped 34 percentage points, while the potential to automate management and develop talent increased from 16 percent in 2017 to 49 percent in 2023. Generative AI’s ability to understand and use natural language for a variety of activities and tasks largely explains why automation potential has risen so steeply. Some 40 percent of the activities that workers perform in the economy require at least a median level of human understanding of natural language.\n\n# Exhibit 10\n\nGenerative AI could have the biggest impact on collaboration and the application of expertise, activities that previously had a lower potential for automation.\n\n|Activity groups|With generative AI|Without generative AI| | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Decision making and collaboration| | |58.5|24.5|\n|Managing| |49.0|15.5| |\n|Interfacing with stakeholders| |45.0|24.0| |\n|Data management|Processing data|90.5|73.0| |\n|Collecting data| | |79.0|68.0|\n|Physical work|Performing unpredictable physical work|46.0|45.5| |\n|Performing predictable physical work| | |73.0|72.5|\n\n1Note: Figures may not sum, because of rounding.\n\n2Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\n3Applying expertise to decision making, planning, and creative tasks.\n\n4Managing and developing people.\n\n5Performing physical activities and operating machinery in unpredictable environments.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nAs a result, many of the work activities that involve communication, supervision, documentation, and interacting with people in general have the potential to be automated by generative AI, accelerating the transformation of work in occupations such as education and technology, for which automation potential was previously expected to emerge later (Exhibit 11).\n\n# Exhibit 11\n\nAdvances in technical capabilities could have the most impact on activities performed by educators, professionals, and creatives.\n\n# Impact of generative AI on technical automation potential in midpoint scenario, 2023\n\n|Occupation group|Overall technical automation potential, % in 2023|Share of global employment, %|\n|---|---|---|\n|Educator and workforce training|54|4|\n|Business and legal professionals|62|5|\n|STEM professionals|57|3|\n|Community services|65|3|\n|Creatives and arts management|53|1|\n|Office support|87|9|\n|Managers|44|3|\n|Health professionals|43|2|\n|Customer service and sales|57|10|\n|Property maintenance|38|4|\n|Health aides, technicians, and wellness|43|3|\n|Production work|82|12|\n|Food services|78|5|\n|Transportation services|49|3|\n|Mechanical installation and repair|67|4|\n|Agriculture|59|21|\n|Builders|49|7|\n|Total|63|100|\n\nNote: Figures may not sum, because of rounding.\n\n1 Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\n2 Includes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nLabor economists have often noted that the deployment of automation technologies tends to have the most impact on workers with the lowest skill levels, as measured by educational attainment, or what is called skill biased. We find that generative AI has the opposite pattern—it is likely to have the most incremental impact through automating some of the activities of more-educated workers (Exhibit 12).\n\n# Exhibit 12\n\nGenerative AI increases the potential for technical automation most in occupations requiring higher levels of educational attainment.\n\n|Impact of generative AI on technical automation potential in midpoint scenario, 2023|With generative AI|Without generative AI1|Overall technical automation potential, comparison in midpoint scenarios, % in the United States in 2023|Share of US employment, %|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Education level| | | | |\n|Master’s, PhD, or higher|57|28|13| |\n|Bachelor’s degree|60|36|22| |\n|Associate’s degree|62|45|9| |\n|Some college|64|48|22| |\n|High school diploma or equivalent|64|51|24| |\n|No high school degree|63|54|9| |\n\n1Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nAnother way to interpret this result is that gener\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
