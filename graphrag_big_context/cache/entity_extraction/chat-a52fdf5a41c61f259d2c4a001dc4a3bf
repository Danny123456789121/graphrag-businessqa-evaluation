Through our SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises solution and other product lines, we support our customers in their own impact management journeys. As we look ahead, we see the potential for us to place impact management at the center of everything we do and strive to become an impact positive company.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Why Holistic Steering and Reporting Matters section was not subject to an independent limited assurance of our external auditor.\n\n270/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Social Investments Strategy\n\nSAP recognizes the interdependencies between today's environmental and social issues, approaching them with a sustainable corporate strategy. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is part of that strategy, embodying SAP’s purpose to help the world run better and improve people’s lives. CSR at SAP focuses on driving long-term social and environmental impact and business value with three focus areas that power equitable access to economic opportunity, education and employment, and the green economy. These focus areas are Accelerate Social Business, Build Future Skills, and Collaborate for Sustainability.\n\nThe vast majority of our social investments (2023: €25.2 million71) are aligned with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), primarily focusing on quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), and partnership for sustainable development (SDG 17).\n\n# Governance, Guidelines, and Policies\n\nThe head of CSR globally leads the SAP CSR team, reporting to our Global Government Affairs unit. C-level executives from different Board areas form the Global CSR Governance Committee, tasked with guiding, overseeing, and approving SAP’s CSR strategy. Additionally, regional CSR governance committees vet and approve significant CSR alliances and initiatives in collaboration with regional SAP CSR leaders. Our internal SAP CSR policy outlines our focus areas, ensuring our social investments uphold integrity and responsibility. It also delineates the operational standards, clarifying the distinct roles and accountabilities across global CSR, regional CSR, and line-of-business activities.\n\n# Impact Measurement and Management\n\nWe regularly assess the impact of our social investments, reporting specified output metrics for all initiatives across regions: employee engagement, volunteer hours, beneficiaries reached, youth trained, and social enterprises enabled. Moreover, each signature initiative adheres to a tailored impact measurement framework and logic model.72\n\nWe work with third-party evaluators to assess the impact of our initiatives. Specifically, in 2023, an extensive evaluation was conducted on SAP’s Africa Code Week (ACW). From 2015 to 2022, the ACW initiative engaged 14.6 million participants, introducing students to key digital skills essential for tomorrow’s tech workplace. In partnership with UNESCO, SAP’s gender-sensitive program reached primary and secondary school students, 46% of which were girls, across 48 African countries and promoted the integration of coding and computational thinking into seven national curricula, advancing the SDGs 4, 5, and 17.\n\nBy empowering a new generation of youth with the education, knowledge, and ICT skills needed to participate in the digital future, SAP’s program increases the likelihood that ACW beneficiaries will realize higher earnings during their working lives. Based on future increased income, Common Good Marketplace estimates that ACW catalyzed up to $1 billion73 in social value for program participants.\n\n# Equitable Access to Economic Opportunity – Accelerate Social Business\n\nSocial enterprises aim to generate profit while solving social or environmental problems. Unlike traditional businesses, they reinvest most of their earnings into their mission. SAP supports social enterprises through a three-pronged approach. Firstly, SAP enhances their organizational capacity.\n\n71 The topic of SDGs was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n72 See SAP CSR in Review 2023 (link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor).\n\n73 Assuming 50% of program participants achieved moderate learning outcomes in ICT skill improvement (.125 net standard deviation learning gain in ICT skills).\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nwhile developing SAP employees by means of on-site and virtual pro bono consulting. Secondly, by promoting social procurement, SAP facilitates social enterprises to enter new B2B markets such as SAP Business Network. Thirdly, we advocate supportive policies and dedicate (non-)financial resources towards fostering a sustainable and inclusive economy, investing in essential network-building and stakeholder capacity enhancement.\n\nIn 2023, SAP significantly increased its virtual pro-bono consulting offering through the TRANSFORM Support Hub jointly powered by MovingWorlds, Unilever, and TRANSFORM. The global platform connects SAP employees with social enterprises worldwide. It serves as an international one-stop shop for non-financial support to social entrepreneurs, harmonizing resources and offerings from public, private, and social sectors. Pro-bono consulting offers our employees opportunities for personal and professional growth as it does for social entrepreneurs and their businesses.\n\nAs a result, in 2023, SAP made direct capacity for non-profit organizations and social enterprises through in-kind contributions of US$3.7 million (€3.3 million)74 through 140 consulting projects. The number of employees engaged as pro-bono consultants increased 45% year over year to 518.\n\n# Equitable Access to Education and Employment – Build Future Skills\n\nSAP invests in innovative education models and fosters engagement with multistakeholder partnerships to enable pathways to employment and entrepreneurship in the sustainable and digital economy for youth in need (underrepresented, underserved\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
