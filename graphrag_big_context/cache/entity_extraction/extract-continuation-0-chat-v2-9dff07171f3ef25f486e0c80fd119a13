Judgment is required in identifying an appropriate method to measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of such performance obligations. We typically measure progress of our development agreements based on the direct costs incurred to date in developing the software as a percentage of the total reasonably estimated direct costs to fully complete the development.\n\n164/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThis method of measuring progress faithfully depicts the transfer of the development services to the customer, as substantially all of these costs are cost of the staff or third parties performing the development work. In estimating the total cost to fully complete the development work, we consider our history with similar projects.\n\nFor agreements that combine the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future, unspecific software products, we recognize revenue at a point in time for licenses that are made immediately accessible to the customer. We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the software subscription contract for the unspecified software products, as our performance obligation is to stand ready to deliver such products on a when-and-if-available basis.\n\nSoftware support revenue is typically recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the term of the support arrangement. Under our standardized support services, our performance obligation is to stand ready to provide technical product support and unspecified updates, upgrades, and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. Our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of these support services as we perform.\n\nService revenue is typically recognized over time. Where we stand ready to provide the service (such as access to learning content), we recognize revenue based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the service period. Consumption-based services (such as separately identifiable consulting services and premium support services and classroom training services) are recognized over time as the services are utilized, typically following the percentage-of-completion method or ratably. When using the percentage-of-completion method, we typically measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation in the same way and with the same reasoning and judgment as we do for customer-specific on-premise software development agreements. We apply judgment in determining whether a service qualifies as a stand-ready service or as a consumption-based service.\n\nRevenue for combined performance obligations is recognized over the longest period of all promises in the combined performance obligation. Judgment is also required in determining whether revenue is to be recognized at a point in time or over time. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we need to measure progress using the method that best reflects SAPâ€™s performance. When using cost incurred as a measure of progress for recognizing revenue over time, we apply judgment in estimating the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation. All of the judgments and estimates mentioned above can significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized.\n\n# Contract Balances\n\nWe recognize trade receivables for performance obligations satisfied over time gradually as the performance obligation is satisfied and in full once the invoice is due. Judgment is required in determining whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable. Contract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due or payments received in advance of revenue recognition.\n\nTypically, we invoice fees for on-premise standard software on contract closure and software delivery. Periodic fixed fees for cloud subscription services, software support services, and other multi-period agreements are typically invoiced yearly or quarterly in advance. Such fee prepayments account for the majority of our contract liability balance. Fees based on actual transaction volumes for cloud subscriptions and fees charged for non-periodical services are invoiced as the services are delivered. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type and region, our terms typically require payment within 30 to 60 days.\n\n# Geographic Information\n\nThe amounts for revenue by region in the following tables are based on the location of customers. The regions in the following table are EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Americas (North America and Latin America), and APJ (Asia Pacific Japan).\n\n165/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Total Revenue by Region\n\n|â‚¬ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Germany|4,921|4,469|4,324|\n|Rest of EMEA|9,083|8,440|8,135|\n|EMEA|14,004|12,909|12,458|\n|United States|10,204|9,799|8,235|\n|Rest of Americas|2,558|2,427|2,056|\n|Americas|12,762|12,227|10,292|\n|Japan|1,243|1,218|1,286|\n|Rest of APJ|3,199|3,166|2,917|\n|APJ|4,441|4,384|4,204|\n|SAP Group|31,207|29,520|26,953|\n\n# Major Revenue Classes by Region\n\n| |Cloud Revenue|Cloud and Software Revenue|â‚¬ millions|2023|2022|2021|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|EMEA|5,241|4,137|3,196|12\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, known for its ERP software solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is a country in Europe where SAP generates significant revenue, with reported figures of â‚¬4,921 million in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country in North America where SAP also generates substantial revenue, reporting â‚¬10,204 million in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMEA<|>GEO<|>EMEA stands for Europe, Middle East, and Africa, a region where SAP reported total revenue of â‚¬14,004 million in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAS<|>GEO<|>Americas refers to the region encompassing North America and Latin America, where SAP reported total revenue of â‚¬12,762 million in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APJ<|>GEO<|>APJ stands for Asia Pacific Japan, a region where SAP reported total revenue of â‚¬4,441 million in 2023.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMANY<|>SAP generates significant revenue from its operations in Germany, reporting â‚¬4,921 million in 2023<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>UNITED STATES<|>SAP generates substantial revenue from its operations in the United States, reporting â‚¬10,204 million in 2023<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>EMEA<|>SAP's total revenue from the EMEA region is â‚¬14,004 million in 2023, indicating strong business presence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>AMERICAS<|>SAP's total revenue from the Americas region is â‚¬12,762 million in 2023, indicating strong business presence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>APJ<|>SAP's total revenue from the APJ region is â‚¬4,441 million in 2023, indicating strong business presence<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
