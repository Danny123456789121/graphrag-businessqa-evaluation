Share units with switched classification are considered in the number of granted share units.\n\nThe weighted average share price for awards exercised in 2023 was €130.59 (2022: €92.00).\n\n# Own SAP Plan (Own)\n\nUnder the share purchase plan Own, employees have the opportunity to purchase, on a monthly basis, SAP shares without any required holding period. The investment per each eligible employee is limited to a percentage of the respective employee’s monthly base salary. SAP matches the employee investment by 40% and adds a subsidy of €20 per month for non-executives. As part of SAP’s 50th anniversary celebration, SAP’s contribution was temporarily doubled from 40% to 80% from January to March 2022, contributing to the peak in 2022.

Since 2022, we intend to settle share units granted from then on predominantly in shares. For more information about the terms and conditions of the equity-settled Move, see section a) Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments in this Note (B.3). Obligations from outstanding share units granted before 2022 will continue to be settled in cash.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, we granted share units under the Grow SAP Plan that we intend to settle in cash. This fixed term plan has broadly the same terms and conditions as Move and recognizes all employees’ commitment to SAP’s success, and deepens their participation in our future company performance.\n\nDifferent vesting schedules apply to specific share units. Granted share units under the respective plans will vest in different tranches, mainly as follows:\n\n- Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) with service condition only\n- Over a half-year period,\n- Over a three-year period on annual basis,\n- Over a three-year period on a quarterly basis after a waiting period of six months, or\n- Performance Share Units (PSUs) with service condition and upon achieving certain key performance indicators (KPIs)\n- Over a three-year period, or\n- Over a three-year period on a quarterly basis after a waiting period of 12 months.\n\nThe number of PSUs that will vest under the different tranches is mainly contingent upon achievement of two equally weighted KPIs in the year of grant: operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) and cloud revenue (at constant currencies). Depending on the weighted average performance, the number of PSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number initially granted. Performance against the KPI target was 112.4% in 2023 (2022: 84.3%, 2021: 130.9%).\n\nThe share units classified as cash-settled are paid out in cash upon vesting.\n\n# SAP Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020)\n\nThe LTI 2020 is a long-term, multiyear performance-based element of our Executive Board compensation that is granted in annual tranches.
