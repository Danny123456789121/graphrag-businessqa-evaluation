In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is generally subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. In determining our worldwide income tax provisions, judgment is involved in assessing whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments and whether to reflect the respective effect of uncertainty based on the most likely amount or the expected value. In applying these judgments, we consider the nature and the individual facts and circumstances of each uncertain tax treatment as well as the specifics of the respective jurisdiction, including applicable tax laws and our interpretation thereof.\n\n187/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThe assessment whether a deferred tax asset is impaired requires judgment, as we need to estimate future taxable profits to determine whether the utilization of the deferred tax asset is probable. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable. Our judgment regarding future taxable income is based on assumptions about future market conditions and future profits of SAP. Judgment is also required in evaluating whether interest or penalties related to income taxes meet the definition of income taxes, and, if not, whether it is of financial nature. In this judgment, we particularly consider applicable local tax laws and interpretations on IFRS by national standard setters in the area of group financial reporting.\n\n# Tax Expense by Geographic Location\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Current tax expense| | | |\n|Germany|596|539|603|\n|Foreign|1,356|1,165|1,366|\n|Total current tax expense|1,952|1,704|1,969|\n|Deferred tax expense/income| | | |\n|Germany|74|86|108|\n|Foreign|–285|–344|–395|\n|Total deferred tax income|–211|–258|–287|\n|Total income tax expense|1,741|1,446|1,682|\n\n# Major Components of Tax Expense\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Current tax expense/income| | | |\n|Tax expense for current year|1,935|1,717|1,702|\n|Taxes for prior years|17|–13|267|\n|Total current tax expense|1,952|1,704|1,969|\n|Deferred tax expense/income| | | |\n|Origination and reversal of temporary differences|–222|–216|–311|\n|Unused tax losses, research and development tax credits, and foreign tax credits|11|–42|24|\n|Total deferred tax income|–211|–258|–287|\n|Total income tax expense|1,741|1,446|1,682|\n\n# Profit Before Tax by Geographic Location\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Germany|1,201|1,814|2,057|\n|Foreign|4,140|2,699|6,448|\n|Total|5,341|4,513|8,505|\n\nThe following table reconciles the expected income tax expense, computed by applying our combined German tax rate of 26.5% (2022: 26.4%; 2021: 26.4%), to the actual income tax expense.
