The amortization periods range from five to eight years depending on the type of offering. In addition, the capitalized costs include third-party license fees which are amortized over the term of the third-party license contract. Judgment is required in evaluating whether costs are directly related to customer contracts and in estimating contract lives. Amortization of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts for custom cloud applications and extensions is included in the cost of cloud.\n\n# Capitalized Cost from Contracts with Customers\n\n|€ millions|Current|Non-Current|Total|Current|Non-Current|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Capitalized cost of obtaining customer contracts|1,046|2,918|3,964|871|2,812|3,684|\n|Capitalized cost to fulfill customer contracts|199|236|436|164|206|370|\n|Capitalized contract cost|1,246|3,154|4,400|1,036|3,019|4,054|\n|Other non-financial assets|2,374|3,573|5,947|2,139|3,580|5,719|\n|Capitalized contract cost as % of Other non-financial assets|52|88|74|48|84|71|\n\n# Amortization Expense\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Capitalized cost of obtaining customer contracts|1,000|725|\n|Capitalized cost to fulfill customer contracts|327|243|\n\n# (A.4) Customer-Related Provisions\n\n# Expected Contract Losses\n\nCustomer-related provisions mainly include expected contract losses. We adjust these provisions as further information becomes available and as circumstances change. Non-current provisions are measured at the present value of their expected settlement amounts as at the reporting date. The unit of account for the identification of potential onerous customer contracts is based on the contract definition of IFRS 15 including the contract combination guidance. The economic benefits considered in the assessment comprise the future benefits we are directly entitled to under the contract as well as the anticipated future benefits that are the economic consequence of the contract if these benefits can be reliably determined.\n\n# Customer-Related Litigation and Claims\n\nCustomer-related provisions also include obligations resulting from customer-related litigation and claims. We are currently confronted with various claims and legal proceedings, including claims that relate to customers demanding indemnification for proceedings initiated against them based on their use of SAP software, and occasionally claims that relate to customers being dissatisfied with the\n\n169/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nproducts and services that we have delivered to them. The obligations arising from customer-related litigation and claims comprise cases in which we indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from a claim that our products infringe a third party’s patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary rights.\n\nDue to uncertainties relating to these matters, provisions are based on the best information available. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether and when a provision is to be recorded and what the appropriate amount for such provision should be. Notably, judgment is required in the following areas:\n\n- Determining whether an obligation exists\n- Determining the probability of outflow of economic benefits\n- Determining whether the amount of an obligation is reliably estimable\n- Estimating the amount of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, we reassess the potential obligations related to our pending claims and litigation and adjust our respective provisions to reflect the current best estimate. In addition, we monitor and evaluate new information that we receive after the end of the respective reporting period, but before the Consolidated Financial Statements are authorized for issue, to determine whether this provides additional information regarding conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. Changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our accounting for legal contingencies, and outcomes that differ from these estimates and assumptions, could require material adjustments to the carrying amounts of the respective provisions recorded and additional provisions.\n\nThe expected timing or amounts of any outflows of economic benefits resulting from these lawsuits and claims are uncertain and not estimable, as they generally depend on the duration of the legal proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve the litigation and claims and the unpredictability of the outcomes of legal disputes in several jurisdictions.\n\nContingent liabilities exist in respect of customer-related litigation and claims for which no provision has been recognized. It is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around these lawsuits and claims as outlined above.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Section B – Employees\n\nThis section provides financial insights into our employee benefit arrangements.
