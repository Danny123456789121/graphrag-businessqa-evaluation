We also expect our employees and business partners to respect human rights and avoid complicity in any abuse.\n\n# Due Diligence\n\n# Governance\n\nOur cross-company agenda on human rights is driven by SAP’s Human Rights Office that is part of the chief sustainability officer’s organization. At least once a year, the Human Rights Officer reports to the Executive Board on such matters as the status of compliance with the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, LkSG). The Human Rights Office works together with a Human Rights Steering Committee comprised of executives from various Board areas who embed human rights due diligence in their areas of responsibility, such as enterprise risk management, people management, or procurement.\n\nGrounded in our commitment to respecting human rights, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics Steering Committee guides our internal efforts to implement and enforce AI ethics in our operations, solutions, and policies. It comprises SAP executives from relevant Board areas with supervision of topics relevant to guiding and implementing AI ethics. Made up of experts from academia, industry, and public policy, our external AI Ethics Advisory Panel advises us on how to further develop and operationalize SAP’s Guiding Principles for Artificial Intelligence.\n\n# Policy Commitment\n\nWe support the International Bill of Human Rights; the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Core Labour Rights Conventions. The SAP Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for Employees, and – in a more detailed way – the SAP Global Human Rights Commitment Statement, are our public commitment to respecting and advancing human rights across our value chain. The current version of the Human Rights Commitment Statement is available on our public Web site at www.sap.com/human-rights, has been updated to meet LkSG requirements, and is approved by our Executive Board.\n\nIn addition, our Global AI Ethics Policy helps ensure that our artificial intelligence (AI) software is developed, deployed, and sold in line with the ethical standards laid out in our guiding principles. This policy and guiding principles are available at AI Ethics and Society | SAP.\n\n# How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\n# Identifying Salient Human Rights Issues\n\nIn 2023, we introduced new concepts for identifying human rights impacts across our own operations and our direct supply chain globally to be compliant with increasing legal requirements such as the LkSG. We have complemented this exercise with an analysis of salient issues related to our solutions.\n\n66 Information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n67 Information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nand customers and with a concept to identify human rights impacts among indirect suppliers (that is, tier 2 to n suppliers). Taking into consideration our business activities as described in the Strategy and Business Model section, we assessed potential impacts based on their severity (scale, scope, remediability) and probability of occurrence as well as our ability to trigger change. While our assessment of salient issues is an ongoing process and not yet finalized for all stages of our entire value chain, we have prioritized the following salient issues:\n\n- In our own operations: occupational health and safety and non-discrimination\n- In our direct and indirect supply chain: assessment still ongoing\n- Related to products, services, and customers: non-discrimination and privacy\n\nMoreover, we have started to explore the human rights implications of our net-zero efforts.\n\n# Human Rights of Our Employees\n\nThe salient issues related to health and safety and non-discrimination in our own operations are mitigated through extensive programs for employees as described in the Employees section. In addition, our employees receive voluntary and mandatory training on human rights issues most relevant to SAP. For example, they are trained on our policies on non-discrimination, health and safety, and data protection and privacy. In 2023, we introduced new training modules for all employees, for example to increase the awareness of our grievance mechanism, and for specific roles in procurement and risk management.\n\nWe regularly consulted employee representatives in 2023 to specifically understand their concerns and interests related to the rights protected by the LkSG. The discussions focused on gaining a better understanding of how we identify salient human rights risks and supply chain risks.\n\n# Human Rights in Our Extended Supply Chain\n\nWe expect suppliers and partners to respect human rights, and our codes of conduct require them to uphold international labor rights and provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. We also expect our suppliers to promote these standards across their supply chain. For more information, see the Sustainable Procurement section.\n\n# Human Rights Related to SAP Products, Services, and Customers\n\nWe seek to respect human rights throughout the product lifecycle – from design through to development and use. Protection of personal information and non-discrimination are key areas of focus. For more information about the protection of personal information, see the Security and Privacy section.\n\nPreventing discrimination is currently based on two pillars: First, making our software more accessible is ensured through our own accessibility standards and guidelines that support the possibility for everyone, including people who are differently-abled, to access and use technology and information products. Second, identifying and avoiding bias is a key principle of our Global AI Ethics program. Consequently, we review AI use cases to ensure that bias and discrimination and other ethical risks specified in the Global AI Ethics Policy are mitigated. High-risk AI use cases are approved or rejected by the Global AI Ethics Steering Committee as applicable.\n\n# Assessing Human Rights Measures\n\nSAP reviews the effectiveness of its risk management and due diligence processes annually as well as on an ad hoc basis.
