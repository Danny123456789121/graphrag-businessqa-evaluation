Future payouts under our LTI 2020 will also be dependent on meeting non-market-based performance conditions based on SAPâ€™s long-term strategy. The latter, however, is not incorporated into our fair value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity of awards granted. Changes in these factors could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the valuation model, and the future payout.\n\nUnder the OWN SAP share purchase plan, we grant our employees discounts on share purchases. As those discounts are not dependent on future services to be provided by our employees, the discount is recognized as an expense when the discounts are granted.\n\n# Presentation in the Statements of Cash Flows\n\nWe present the payments of our cash-settled share-based payment plans separately in our Statements of Cash Flows under Cash flows from operating activities. As a result, the changes in other assets and in other liabilities presented in the reconciliation of operating cash flow do not consider share-based payment-related assets or liabilities.\n\n# The operating expense line items in our income statement include the following share-based payment expenses:\n\n|Share-Based Payment Expenses by Functional Area|â‚¬ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cost of cloud| |94|53|51|\n|Cost of software licenses and support| |38|48|49|\n|Cost of services| |375|250|233|\n|Research and development| |703|440|402|\n|Sales and marketing| |834|503|513|\n|General and administration| |175|137|87|\n|Share-based payment expenses| |2,220|1,431|1,334|\n|Thereof cash-settled share-based payments| |806|356|1,136|\n|Thereof equity-settled share-based payments| |1,414|1,075|199|\n\nShare-based payment expenses related to the Qualtrics plan are included in the results from discontinued operations (for more information, see Note (D.1)).\n\n172/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOur major share-based payment plans are described below.\n\n# a) Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments\n\n# Equity-Settled Move SAP Plan (Move)\n\nStarting in 2022, we decided to grant share units under Move that we intend to predominantly settle in shares instead of cash. For more information about the terms and conditions of the cash-settled Move, see section b) Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments in this Note (B.3).\n\nDifferent vesting schedules apply to specific share units. Granted share units will vest in different tranches mainly as follows:\n\n- Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) with service condition only\n- Over a half-year period,\n- Over a three-year period on a quarterly basis after a waiting period of six months, or\n- Performance Share Units (PSUs) with service condition and upon achieving certain key performance indicators (KPIs)\n- Over a one-year period,\n- Over a three-year period on a quarterly basis after a waiting period of 12 months.\n\nThe number of PSUs that will vest under the different tranches is mainly contingent upon achievement of two equally weighted KPIs in the year of grant: Operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) and Cloud revenue (at constant currencies). Depending on the weighted average performance, the number of PSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number initially granted. Performance against the KPI target was 112.4% in 2023 (2022: 84.3%).\n\nWe intend to settle the share units classified as equity-settled by reissuing treasury shares upon vesting (for more information, see Note (E.2)).\n\nThe valuation was based on the following parameters and assumptions:\n\n# Fair Value and Parameters Used at Grant Date in 2023\n\n|â‚¬, unless otherwise stated|Move (2022â€“2023 Tranches)|\n|---|---|\n|Weighted average fair value as at grant date|111.23|\n|Information how fair value was measured at grant date|Valuation model used|\n|Weighted average share price|114.25|\n|Weighted average expected dividend yield (in %)|1.79|\n|Weighted average initial life at grant date (in years)|1.7|\n|Weighted average remaining life of awards outstanding as at 12/31/2023 (in years)|1.1|\n\nFor these awards, the fair value is calculated by subtracting expected future dividends, if any, until maturity of the respective award from the prevailing share price as at the measurement date.\n\n173/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Fair Value and Parameters Used at Grant Date in 2022\n\nâ‚¬, unless otherwise stated\n\n|Weighted average fair value as at grant date|93.80|\n|---|---|\n|Information how fair value was measured at grant date| |\n|Valuation model used|Other1|\n|Weighted average share price|97.61|\n|Weighted average expected dividend yield (in %)|2.43|\n|Weighted average initial life at grant date (in years)|1.6|\n|Weighted average remaining life of awards outstanding as at 12/31/2022 (in years)|1.2|\n\n1 For these awards, the fair value is calculated by subtracting expected future dividends, if any, until maturity of the respective award from the prevailing\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, known for its long-term strategy and share-based payment plans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUALTRICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Qualtrics is a software company that specializes in experience management and is mentioned in relation to SAP's share-based payment plans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVE<|>EVENT<|>The Move plan is an equity-settled share-based payment plan initiated by SAP starting in 2022, which grants share units intended to be settled in shares.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Share-based payment plans are compensation strategies that involve granting employees shares or options as part of their remuneration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASH-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Cash-settled share-based payments are a type of share-based payment where the company pays cash based on the value of shares instead of issuing shares.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Equity-settled share-based payments involve granting shares or share units to employees as part of their compensation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>QUALTRICS<|>SAP includes share-based payment expenses related to the Qualtrics plan in its financial results<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>MOVE<|>SAP initiated the Move plan as part of its equity-settled share-based payment strategy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVE<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS<|>The Move plan is a specific type of share-based payment plan implemented by SAP<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS<|>CASH-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>Cash-settled share-based payments are a category within share-based payment plans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS<|>EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>Equity-settled share-based payments are another category within share-based payment plans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVE<|>EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>The Move plan is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment plan<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
