decrease in deferred tax assets for contract liabilities and the decrease in deferred tax liabilities for intangible assets mainly result from the divestiture of Qualtrics. The increase in deferred tax assets for other in the amount of €236 million (2022: €169 million) and in deferred tax liabilities for trade and other receivables in the amount of €492 million (2022: €288 million), as well as the decrease in deferred tax liabilities for other in the amount of €292 million (2022: €140 million), mainly result from reclassifications, leading to a more consistent presentation of the components of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. The presentation for 2022 remains unchanged in this respect.\n\n# Items Not Resulting in a Deferred Tax Asset\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Unused tax losses| | | |\n|Not expiring|151|315|430|\n|Expiring in the following year|28|14|26|\n|Expiring after the following year|216|344|309|\n|Total unused tax losses|395|673|765|\n|Deductible temporary differences|325|378|602|\n|Unused research and development and foreign tax credits| | | |\n|Not expiring|59|9|28|\n|Expiring after the following year|5|20|20|\n|Total unused tax credits|64|29|48|\n\nOf the unused tax losses, €181 million (2022: €276 million; 2021: €183 million) relate to U.S. state tax loss carryforwards. We have not recognized a deferred tax liability on approximately €22.15 billion (2022: €28.91 billion) for undistributed profits of our subsidiaries, because we are in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n# Income Tax-Related Litigation\n\nWe are subject to ongoing tax audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Currently, we are in dispute mainly with the German and only a few foreign tax authorities. The German dispute is in respect of certain secured capital investments, while the few foreign disputes are mainly in respect of the deductibility of intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. In all cases, we expect that a favorable outcome can only be achieved through litigation. For all of these matters, we have not recorded a provision as we believe that the tax authorities’ claims have no merit and that no adjustment is warranted. If, contrary to our view, the tax authorities were to prevail in their arguments before the court, we would expect to have an additional expense of approximately €1,815 million (2022: €1,607 million) in total (including related interest expenses and penalties of €1,003 million (2022: €881 million)).\n\n# Reform of International Taxation Rules\n\nIn October 2021, over 135 jurisdictions agreed on a new framework for the international tax system covering the re-allocation of taxing rights and the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate. In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released model rules, which shall ensure that multinational enterprises with revenue above €750 million will be subject to a 15% minimum corporate tax rate. In December 2022, the Member States of the European Union (EU) adopted a directive on a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the EU.
