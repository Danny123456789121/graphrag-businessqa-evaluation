In this context, we determine SAP’s greenhouse gas footprint (in the following called carbon emissions) as well as total energy consumed and data center electricity as the three key environmental performance indicators. Furthermore, we realize external compensations through self-generated renewable electricity and by purchasing offsets and Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Plus, we identify water consumption and the end-of-life treatment of SAP’s electrical and electronic equipment as additional environmental topics relevant for our reporting.\n\nOur gross carbon emissions for 2023 were 472 kilotons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) (2022: 441 kilotons CO2e), including all carbon emission categories of Scope 1 and 2, as well as selected categories of Scope 3 relevant for our carbon neutrality target as described in Methodology and Further Details below. Our net carbon emissions (0 kilotons in 2023) are calculated by deducting purchased EACs, self-generated renewable electricity, and carbon offsets from our gross emissions in the reporting period. We disclose various environmental performance indicators, including carbon neutral-relevant Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in the Report Data Hub82.\n\n# Reporting Approach\n\nData for our environmental indicators is collected and reported on a quarterly basis and is subject to external assurance for annual reporting (limited or reasonable assurance). Reporting on total energy consumed and data center electricity is based on the data collected for the calculation of our carbon emissions. All numbers are based on the metric system. Whenever we state “tons,” we mean metric tons.\n\n# Carbon Emissions\n\n# Definition\n\nWe define the gross carbon emissions as the sum of all greenhouse gas emissions, measured and reported as CO2e, while net carbon emissions include the compensation with renewable electricity2 and carbon offsets (for more information, see External Reductions below).\n\n# Reporting Principles\n\nSAP’s preparation of the carbon emissions is based on the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard of the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. This approach conforms to the requirements of GRI Standard indicators 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3.\n\nIn alignment with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, we report our net carbon emissions based on the two different calculation approaches: location-based and market-based.\n\n81 Link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Junior Achievement is a global nonprofit organization that aims to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy through educational programs and initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KLIMABÜNDNIS BADEN-WÜRTTEMBERG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Klimabündnis Baden-Württemberg is an organization focused on climate protection and sustainability initiatives in the Baden-Württemberg region of Germany.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Information Technology Industry Council is a trade association that represents the technology sector in the United States, advocating for policies that foster innovation and economic growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS ASSOCIATION OF TURKEY (YASED)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>YASED is an organization that represents international investors in Turkey, promoting foreign investment and advocating for a favorable business environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATIN CODE WEEK<|>EVENT<|>Latin Code Week is an initiative aimed at promoting coding and digital skills among young people in Latin America through workshops and educational activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEAF COALITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The LEAF Coalition is a global initiative focused on reducing deforestation and promoting sustainable land use practices through financial incentives and partnerships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, known for its ERP solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNICEF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UNICEF is a United Nations agency responsible for providing humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide, focusing on health, education, and protection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (WEF)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Economic Forum is an international organization for public-private cooperation, known for its annual meetings in Davos, Switzerland, where leaders discuss global issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (WBCSD)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WBCSD is a global organization of companies that are committed to sustainable development, working to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT<|>LATIN CODE WEEK<|>Junior Achievement may collaborate with Latin Code Week to promote coding education among youth<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEAF COALITION<|>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (WEF)<|>The LEAF Coalition may partner with the WEF to address climate change and sustainability issues<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS ASSOCIATION OF TURKEY (YASED)<|>SAP<|>YASED may engage with SAP to enhance technological investments in Turkey<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNICEF<|>WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (WBCSD)<|>UNICEF and WBCSD may collaborate on initiatives that promote children's rights and sustainable business practices<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL<|>SAP<|>The Information Technology Industry Council may work with SAP to advocate for technology policies that benefit the industry<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
