The index is measured by three questions in our #Unfiltered program (April 2023 survey).\n\nSimplification of Processes: Shows the impact of our continued efforts to simplify our processes. The index is measured by nine questions in our #Unfiltered program (October 2023 survey).\n\nEmployee Retention: Ratio of the average number of employees minus the employees who left voluntarily, to the average number of employees, taking into account the past 12 months (in full-time equivalents, or FTEs). This ratio puts emphasis on employee-initiated turnover. In other words, we seek to measure how many employees choose to stay with SAP. As opposed to keeping a low turnover rate, we aim to keep our retention rate high. The number of employees who left voluntarily excludes those who left voluntarily as part of restructuring-related departures, for more transparency and precise headcount management purposes.\n\nWomen in Management: We define “women in management” as the share of women in management positions as compared to the total number of managers, expressed by the number of individuals and not FTEs. It includes three categories: 1) Managers managing teams: Refers to managing teams of at least one employee or vacant position; 2) Managers managing managers: Refers to managing managers who manage teams; and 3) Executive Board members. For 2023, we kept our ambition to increase the rate of women in management to 30%. Our aspiration is to reach gender parity in our workforce at all levels and to retain women leaders.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nAs part of our strategic pillar “Build SAP’s Skills for the Future,” we focus on the skills transformation of our workforce. We have established one unified skills library, and are working to unify existing skills management tools to implement one single platform, SAP SuccessFactors, for all employees. This will enable greater skills transparency, data-driven workforce planning, and intentional upskilling, as well as enhance our processes from hire to retire. Our learning strategy is closely aligned with our product and customer strategies to drive cohesive, skill-based development for both our ecosystem and our workforce.\n\n# External hires\n\n# Early Talent hires and pipeline programs\n\n- 7,187 (FTE) (2022: 12,564) employees, of which 41.5% were women (2022: 38.1%)\n- Attracting diverse talent is supported by initiatives such as the SAP Returnship program for professionals who have taken a career break for caregiving, relocation, or military service.\n- Early Talent hires: out of 7,187 hired employees, 37.8% (FTE) (2022: 27.9%) are Early Talents.\n- Vocational Training / SAP Student Training and Rotation (VT/ STAR) program: average of 1,454 students and apprentices (from Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, South-East Asia, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States); conversion rate of 82% (2022: 78%)\n- Cooperation with more than 2,700 academic institutions (events, executive lectures, office visits, competitions)\n- SAP Internship Experience Program: 1,568 (2022: 1,662) global participants in 22 countries\n\n# Global onboarding\n\n- New employees must attend virtual corporate onboarding sessions (a total of 12 hours) that ensure they understand SAP’s strategy, culture, structure, operations, and success metrics.\n- Around 4,500 new hires completed these sessions in 2023, with a customer satisfaction rate of 4.5.\n- For new hires in customer-facing sales roles, corporate onboarding is complemented by role-based onboarding. In 2023, 1,212 new hires in customer-facing sales roles completed our role-based onboarding program. With each new hire completing at least 80 to 90 hours of learning, total trackable learning was more than 97,000 hours.\n\n# Continuous learning, upskilling, and engagement\n\n- Self-paced online and live interactive training, and a peer-to-peer learning portfolio for all employees\n- Role-based solution upskilling program for customer-facing functions (completion rate: 53%)\n- Cloud upskilling program that reached 39,618 employees (2022: 34,233)\n- High employee-learning participation rate: in 2023, the participation rate was 99%, resulting in more than 2.3 million learning hours (2021: more than 3 million hours; 2022: more than 3.1 million hours with a 98% participation rate), and 12,057 individuals spent more than 50 hours learning.\n- More than 1.8 million external learners upskilled on SAP solutions and technologies in 2023 as part of our ambition to upskill 2 million learners annually by 2025, including programs for underrepresented groups to build digital skills.\n\n# Succession management process\n\nSuccession pipeline defined by supporting targeted development and facilitating Executive Board exposure in roundtables for incumbents and identified successors of executive roles.\n\n# SAP Alumni Network\n\n25,559 former employees (2022: 20,054); 5,903 current employees (2022: 5,444).\n\n# Candidate and hiring manager experience\n\nIt is our goal to differentiate SAP by creating a great experience in every interaction.
