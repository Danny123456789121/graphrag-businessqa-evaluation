Looking at the geopolitical landscape, new crises surfaced as old ones had not yet settled, and conflicts in multiple regions kept the world on edge. Looking at the climate, record global temperatures and extreme weather events underlined the urgency to accelerate climate action. At the same time, change continued to be the only constant in the tech industry. The year saw incredible leaps especially in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), and consumer applications rapidly captured the imagination of the global public. It also became clear, though, that the true value of this seminal technology lies in its application to the business world. GenAI will be a powerful tool to transform companies and to make the world economy more sustainable, resilient, and fair overall. At a time when humanity’s challenges become ever more complex, GenAI promises to drastically expand our capacity to find solutions – and to do more with less.\n\nAll these global developments have a direct relevance for SAP. Our solutions touch 87% of global commerce and help keep companies, economies, and global business resilient in volatile times. Our sustainability offering enables customers to systematically track key metrics, including carbon emissions, and to take effective action. Meanwhile, SAP is increasingly embedding business AI in all our solutions. We’re doing our part to make the technology a powerful, readily accessible tool for organizations to become more efficient, more sustainable, and more innovative.\n\nToday, SAP is stronger and more relevant than ever. And this is also visible in our business results: In 2023, we met or exceeded our outlook in all key metrics. Current Cloud Backlog surpassed\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n€13.7 billion, growing 27%1, while Cloud Revenue went up 23%1 to €13.7 billion\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
