The following committees were in place in the year under review: Personnel and Governance Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, Finance and Investment Committee, Technology and Strategy Committee, People and Culture Committee, Nomination Committee, Go-To-Market and Operations Committee.\n\nEach of the aforementioned committees was active in 2023. For more information about the Supervisory Board committees, particularly their respective composition, tasks, and responsibilities, see the Corporate Governance Statement and the Corporate Governance section of SAP’s Web site.\n\nBesides the matters described above, the committees focused primarily on the following topics in 2023:\n\n- The Personnel and Governance Committee held six meetings in the reporting year. In particular, the Committee, in fulfillment of the tasks assigned to it, extensively prepared the Supervisory Board’s deliberations and resolutions described above on Executive Board compensation and on the new Government Security Committee, and approved resolution proposals. The Committee adopted a total of three resolutions by correspondence vote. In two sessions in January 2023, the Committee dealt with the renewal of Scott Russell and Julia White’s Executive Board contracts, and with the introduction of compensation for the Lead Independent Director after it had become apparent that this role involves considerable additional time and effort. In addition, the Committee consented to the secondary employment of an Executive Board member and examined the German Federal Labor Court’s ruling on SAP’s Employee Involvement Agreement.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
