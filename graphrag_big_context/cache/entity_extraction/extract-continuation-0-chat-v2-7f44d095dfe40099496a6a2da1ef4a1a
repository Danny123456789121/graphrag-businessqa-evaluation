Dependent variable is the dummy variable CSP that is assigned 1 if the firm i is listed at the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA (ISE) in the year t and 0 otherwise. HI5 is the Herfindahl index for voting ownership concentration held by the five main shareholders. OWNC (1-5) refers to the sum of voting shares (%) held by the main one up to the five main shareholders. ROA is return on assets. GOPP stands for growth opportunities, proxied by Tobin’s q. SIZE (Ln of total assets) proxies for firm size. DEBT is leverage measured as total debt divided by total assets; , and  refer to 1, 5 and 10% significance levels, respectively ownership concentration is in hands of the four and five main shareholders (OWNC4 to OWNC5) (Table IV, columns vi and vii). That means that higher voting concentrated ownership among the four and five main large shareholders may signal that the presence of more than three large blockholders is able to reduce the detrimental effect of up to three controlling shareholders on sustainability performance. This finding is in the direction of the contest power of blockholders over the excess power of one or two large controlling shareholders (Jara-Bertin et al., 2008). Besides the contest power, this could also be because of advances in blockholders’ sensitivity to CSR issues in more recent periods because of local and global institutional pressures.\n\nAs proposed under the rationale of H2, an important firm attribute – the firm pertinence to an environmental risky industry (RSKIND) – may be an important determinant for the degree of firm CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries seem to be more committed to social and sustainability issues signaling that such firms believe that higher CSP is an important instrument to improve firm reputation and legitimacy of its activities. The activities undertaken by such firms to manage environmental concerns may probably increase their punctuation in ISE’s inquire at the same time that these firms are probably struggling to be a member of the annual ISE list as a way to show that they are actually concerned with sustainability issues. In fact, a detailed analysis of membership to the ISE sustainability index shows that firms seem to make an effort to be at the ISE index as depicted by the presence of firms in consecutive years. Among these persistent firms, many of them are from environmental risky industries, as is the case of AES ELETROPAULO, CEMIG, CPFL ENERGIA and BRASKEM which were present in ten periods at ISE, or GERDAU and SUZANO PAPEL which were at the ISE index in nine periods (Crisostomo et al., 2018).\n\nContrary to our expectation, profitability is not a determinant for the degree of CSP (H3). In fact, the set of results in the literature are not conclusive about this effect. Perhaps, the\n\nFinancial slack resources proposal may not hold for the Brazilian firm given that it faces financial constraints for investment (Crisostomo et al., 2014; Bassetto and Kalatzis, 2011) which may signal the absence of slack resources that could be used to fund social and sustainability activities. Other firm attributes have shown to be able to affect CSP. In fact, firm size has a positive effect over CSP as argued under H4, supporting the suggestion that larger firms are more capable of addressing social and sustainability concerns given that they tend to have more resources available for that (Udayasankar, 2008). Firm growth opportunities also have a positive effect over CSP as proposed under the rationale of H5 that the need to seize growth opportunities will require more firm commitment to social and sustainability concerns, as well as with good corporate governance practices, given that this may be relevant in the search for funds to finance firms’ investment projects.\n\nThe alternate models estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms with the debt variable (DEBT) included as an explanatory variable are shown in Table VI. As can be derived from models coefficients, the aforementioned results were confirmed. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries (RSKIND) present higher probability of being a leading CSP firm. High ownership concentration indeed has a negative effect on firm’s CSP and the absence of such adverse effect for the concentration in hands of the main four and five shareholders (OWNC4 and OWNC5) signal that more large shareholders are able to minimize such negative effect on firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Table VI, columns vi and vii). The same result holds for larger firms and firms with more growth opportunities.\n\nAs hypothesized, growth opportunities have a positive effect on Brazilian firm CSP proxied by the firm pertinence to the ISE index. Indeed, a firm with more growth opportunities needs all available funds to maximize them. For so, the firm must signal that it ratifies good corporate governance practices and has sustainability as a relevant concern. This is crucial in the financial market. This finding of the positive influence of growth opportunities on CSP is in accordance with previous results (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Ziegler and Schro¨der, 2010).\n\nThe positive effect of firm size on CSP of Brazilian firm follows the theoretical proposal that larger firms are more able to undertake social responsibility actions (CSR) and, in parallel, are required to show more high standards of sustainability concerns. This finding is also consistent with previous studies in different markets, including Brazil (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Nunes et al., 2010).\n\nContrary to the expected negative effect, there is no effect of debt over CSP according to the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AES ELETROPAULO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AES Eletropaulo is a company that has been listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA for ten periods, indicating its commitment to sustainability issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEMIG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CEMIG is a company recognized for its sustainability efforts, having been present in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA for ten periods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPFL ENERGIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CPFL Energia is a firm that has shown commitment to sustainability, being listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA for ten periods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRASKEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Braskem is a company that has been part of the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA for ten periods, reflecting its focus on sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERDAU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gerdau is a firm that has been included in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA for nine periods, indicating its commitment to sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUZANO PAPEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Suzano Papel is a company recognized for its sustainability efforts, having been listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA for nine periods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BM&FBOVESPA is the Brazilian stock exchange that includes the Corporate Sustainability Index, which evaluates firms based on their sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSP<|>EVENT<|>CSP refers to Corporate Sustainability Performance, a measure used to evaluate firms' commitment to sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AES ELETROPAULO<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>AES Eletropaulo is listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, indicating its commitment to sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEMIG<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>CEMIG is listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, reflecting its sustainability efforts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPFL ENERGIA<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>CPFL Energia is included in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, showcasing its commitment to sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRASKEM<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>Braskem is part of the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, indicating its focus on sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERDAU<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>Gerdau is recognized in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, showing its commitment to sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUZANO PAPEL<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>Suzano Papel is listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, reflecting its sustainability efforts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>CSP is a measure evaluated by BM&FBOVESPA to assess firms' sustainability performance<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
