The eligibility assessment for 2023 is in accordance with the current EU Taxonomy regulation and reflects the changes published in the Environmental Delegated Act as well as the amendments to the Climate Delegated Act. As a result, SAP has identified two activities as relevant for disclosure, and examined whether they qualify as Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n# Taxonomy-Eligible Economic Activities of SAP\n\n# Activity 8.1 “Data processing, hosting, and related activities” (substantial contribution to climate change mitigation)\n\nIn this area of activity, we looked at our data centers and our relevant cloud solutions. The criteria for the Taxonomy alignment of activity 8.1 were not met in financial year 2023. We expect to make progress on the transition from Taxonomy-eligible to Taxonomy-aligned over the next few years as we work toward meeting the technical screening criteria. For instance, under the EU Taxonomy regulation, refrigerants used in data centers must not exceed a certain level of global warming potential. The refrigerants SAP uses do not meet these thresholds yet. Replacing them right away would create toxic waste and generate additional costs. Therefore, we intend to replace the refrigerants according to our regular maintenance schedule over the course of the next few years. Also, SAP’s data center colocations and hyperscalers do not yet fully meet the criteria set out in the Taxonomy regulation. We are working with our providers to evaluate options to reach Taxonomy alignment over the next few years.\n\n# Activity 3.3 “Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport” (substantial contribution to climate change mitigation)\n\nThis economic activity includes the vehicles purchased for the SAP car fleet. In 2023, SAP capitalized an amount of €210 million. For most of our electric vehicles, we were able to obtain the proof required for Taxonomy alignment from our suppliers, allowing us to report €51 million as Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n# Other activity\n\nIn single locations, SAP operates combined heat/cool and power generation facilities using fossil gaseous fuels. However, the associated Taxonomy-eligible and aligned revenues, capital expenditures, and operational expenditures are negligible. No further activities for nuclear or gas are applicable.\n\n# Minimum safeguards\n\nSAP has conducted a review of all core topics of the minimum safeguards to ensure compliance. Our global due diligence processes ensure that SAP upholds and meets the requirements under the minimum safeguards.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Revenue\n\n# € millions, unless otherwise stated\n\n|Financial Year|2023|Substantial Contribution Criteria|DNSH Criteria (“Does Not Significantly Harm”)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Economic Activities (1)|Code1|Turnover (3)|Turnover 2022|\n| |Propor-|Climate|Climate|\n| |Change|Change|Water|\n| |Pollu-|Econo-|versity|\n| |Climate|Climate|Circular|\n| |Taxonomy-|gory|Transitional|\n|A.
