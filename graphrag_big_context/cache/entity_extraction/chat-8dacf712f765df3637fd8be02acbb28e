As described below, no material changes occurred.\n\nBelow, we have detailed the key stages of the process we followed to assess the significance of each economic, social, and environmental impact.\n\n# Identification\n\nWe compiled a list of relevant topics that builds on the long list of 2020, using the artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data solution from Datamaran Limited. To ensure timeliness and completeness, we enriched the list with an analysis of further external sources covering, among others, corporate peer reports as well as mandatory and voluntary regulations for the software sector. To identify key topics and their boundaries, we looked at areas related to our operations and supply chain and at topics related to our solutions. Additional topics identified were added and mapped to the long list.\n\n# Prioritization\n\nTo assess the significance of each topic on the updated long list, we considered the following two perspectives:\n\n1. Outside-in perspective (impact of the topic on SAP)\n2. Inside-out perspective (SAP’s impact on the topic)\n\nTo assess the outside-in perspective, we evaluated the financial, strategic, and regulatory relevance of each topic to SAP’s business success and resilience. To this end, we ranked the topics and applied thresholds.\n\nNext, we assessed the inside-out perspective. In a first step, we qualitatively described positive and negative impact scenarios for each topic on the list based on the results of the impact assessment, using the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA) methodology, through which we aim to monetarily measure SAP’s impact on society and environment across the value chain, see the Why Holistic Steering and Reporting Matters section.\n\nFollowing this, we assessed each negative impact scenario according to its likelihood and severity (scale, scope, remediability), and each positive impact scenario according to its likelihood, scale, and scope. We considered mitigation measures in place in the course of this process, and hence the net risks. During the assessment, we considered the input of several SAP sustainability experts from various units and regions, taking different stakeholders’ perspectives70 into account.\n\nNext, we prioritized the assessed impacts by translating the result of each evaluation category into numeric values, ranking the topics, and applying thresholds to derive the material topics for SAP from the inside-out perspective.\n\nAccording to section 289c (3) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), the material topics are identified by considering both the inside-out and outside-in perspectives.\n\n70 Represented stakeholder groups are further explained in section Stakeholder Engagement.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nIn contrast, the material topics according to GRI 3 only take into account the inside-out perspective including the impact on human rights, in the context of their activities and business relationships.\n\n# Validation\n\nThe results of the 2022 materiality assessment were reviewed and confirmed by our executive owners for integrated reporting. Our CFO thereafter approved the materiality assessment.\n\n# Review\n\nFeedback on and analysis of our integrated report will be taken into account during future materiality assessments.\n\n# Results\n\nIn our reporting, we seek to meet the materiality requirements of both the GRI Standards and section 289c (3) of the HGB despite diverging definitions. The following topics are material according to the HGB and/or GRI:\n\n|Topic|Definitions|Topic Material According to HGB|Topic Material According to GRI|Related Non-Financial Matters|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection|Protection of private, confidential, or sensitive information and data, as well as the vulnerability of critical information systems| | | |\n|Ethics and compliance|Responsible business conduct, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery, fair competition, respect for intellectual property, and responsible tax principles| | |Anti-corruption and bribery matters|\n|Climate change and air quality|(Non-)greenhouse gas emissions from operations and products, as well as present or potential disruptive impacts of climate change| | |Environmental matters|\n|Customer responsibility|Responsibility to help ensure customer satisfaction and customer rights, including responsible marketing and selling practices| | | |\n|Employee engagement|Corporate culture, employee engagement and motivation, and strategic decisions involving workforce changes| | |Employee matters|\n|Employee rights|Labor rights, including unionization, as well as compensation and benefits offered to employees by their employer| | |Employee matters|\n|Well-being, health, and safety|Social, economic, psychological, and physical conditions of employees in their workplace, as well as employees’ occupational health and safety| | |Employee matters|\n|Human rights|Fundamental rights of all individuals to live in dignity| | |Respect for human rights|\n|Fair and inclusive workplace|Active integration, equal opportunity, and fair treatment\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
