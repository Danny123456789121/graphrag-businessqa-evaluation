The new six-member Government Security Committee was subsequently established, its rules of procedure adopted, and its members elected during the October meeting of the Supervisory Board. The Committee began its work in January 2024.\n\n# Sustainability\n\nDue to the comprehensive strategic importance that sustainability has for SAP and its customers, the Supervisory Board addressed the sustainability aspects that are relevant to SAP numerous times throughout the fiscal year 2023. It is important to note here that SAP promotes sustainability in two different ways: by offering solutions that empower SAP customers to become more sustainable enterprises, and by aligning its own business activities with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) goals and targets. The entire spectrum of SAP’s sustainability efforts and sustainability solutions is a cross topic that is monitored and covered by several committees. That is why the Supervisory Board has not formed a pure ESG or sustainability committee. By continuously addressing sustainability issues both in plenary sessions and in the committees, we have been able to build extensive expertise in this area: specifically, the Audit and Compliance Committee monitored the sustainability reporting and the way the reports are created and managed, and the Personnel and Governance Committee dealt with sustainability targets relevant to Executive Board compensation. The Technology and Strategy Committee, meanwhile, concerned itself with sustainability-related products and software as well as IT security, whereas the People and Culture Committee addressed\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nSustainability as it relates to social issues. On top of this, the full Supervisory Board was updated on SAP’s current sustainability portfolio and the planned expansion of this product range at its meeting in April. As part of the October meeting, the Supervisory Board had the opportunity to examine the topic of sustainability at SAP based on a detailed meeting document that highlighted, in particular, SAP’s goal to emit zero greenhouse gas emissions from 2030 onwards, general human rights topics, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, and best practices for responsible AI.\n\nOther key topics addressed at our meetings in 2023 notably included the following:\n\n# Meeting in February (Meeting to Discuss the Financial Statements)\n\nAt our ordinary Supervisory Board meeting on February 22, 2023, we adopted the resolutions required under the current Executive Board compensation package for fiscal 2022 and 2023. To this end, we first determined performance against the defined target for the short-term incentive (STI) 2022, and then set the performance targets for the STI 2023. In addition, we resolved the individual allocation amount for the 2023 tranche of the long-term incentive (LTI) 2020. Finally, we evaluated the appropriateness of the Executive Board members’ compensation for 2022, and in each case found it to be appropriate in terms of amount, structure, objective criteria, and reasonable and appropriate in relation to the Company's circumstances, also in regard to its profit and outlook. We referred in this regard to a certificate obtained beforehand from an independent compensation consultant. For more information about the STI 2022 and 2023, the LTI 2020, and the other compensation elements for Executive Board members, see the Compensation Report.\n\nWe also discussed the upcoming reappointments of, and thus renewals of the contracts with, Julia White, Sabine Bendiek, and Scott Russell at this meeting. In this connection, the Supervisory Board chairperson reported that Sabine Bendiek would not be standing for a further term of office. We thereafter resolved to offer both Scott Russell and Julia White reappointment and renewal of their Executive Board contracts by a further three years until 2027, and to negotiate new contracts with them. We also concerned ourselves with succession planning for Sabine Bendiek.\n\nNext, we passed the proposed resolutions for the SAP SE Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 11, 2023. In particular, these proposals included the proposed election of Punit Renjen as a new Supervisory Board member with the intention of establishing him as a successor to the Supervisory Board chair, and the re-election of Jennifer Li and Qi Lu. The auditor for the 2023 financial year had already been elected by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 18, 2022, in view of the upcoming change of auditor, which is why there was no proposal for a resolution in this regard. Further, we received an Executive Board report on business in 2022 and adopted the budget for 2023 after discussing same extensively with the Executive Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board turned its attention to the SAP SE financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2022. On recommendation of the Audit and Compliance Committee, we approved the audit and gave our consent to the financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2022. In addition, we endorsed the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings for 2022, and approved the compensation report for fiscal 2022. Beyond this, the Executive Board gave us an overview of SAP’s equity investments and donation activities in 2022.\n\n# Extraordinary Meeting in March\n\nWe held an extraordinary meeting on March 12, 2023, to discuss the sale already underway of SAP’s interest in Qualtrics International Inc. (“Qualtrics”), a U.S.-listed company. The Executive Board and the Finance and Investment Committee explained the economic background of this move to us. In preparation for this meeting, we obtained written answers to questions the Supervisory Board members had submitted in advance regarding the sale of Qualtrics. We ultimately approved the divestiture\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
