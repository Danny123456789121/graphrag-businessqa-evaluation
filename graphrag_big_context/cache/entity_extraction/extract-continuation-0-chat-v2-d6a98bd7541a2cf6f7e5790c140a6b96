The R&D expense was also impacted by several initiatives to capture current and future growth opportunities. R&D expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 20.3% in 2023 (2022: 20.6%). For more information, see the Our Investments in Innovation section.\n\n76/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Sales and Marketing Expense\n\nSales and marketing expense consists mainly of personnel costs, direct sales costs, and the cost of marketing our products and services. Our sales and marketing expense grew 11% from €7,946 million in 2022 to €8,828 million in 2023. This increase is mainly attributable to higher personnel costs due to higher bonus payments prompted by strong revenue growth. In addition, travel costs for sales teams increased as COVID-related global travel restrictions accelerated to ease. Accordingly, the ratio of sales and marketing expense to total revenue, expressed as a percentage, increased 1.4pp in 2023 to 28.3% (2022: 26.9%).\n\n# General and Administration Expense\n\nOur general and administration expense consists mainly of personnel costs to support our finance and administration, human resource, and corporate functions. General and administration expense increased 6% from €1,289 million in 2022 to €1,364 million in 2023. This increase is primarily due to higher personnel expenses in 2023, the majority thereof due to higher bonus payments. The ratio of general and administration expense to total revenue was flat year over year at 4.4% (2022: 4.4%).\n\n# Segment Information\n\nAt the end of 2023, SAP had one reportable segment: Applications, Technology & Services.
