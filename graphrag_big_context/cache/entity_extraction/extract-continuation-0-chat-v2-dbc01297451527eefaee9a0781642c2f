Representing the end points of a continuum, the two ideal-type frames conceptualize this relationship by either aligning environmental and social aspects with the economic dimension (business case frame) or by accepting and accommodating the interrelated yet contradictory nature of all three aspects (paradoxical frame). Since ideal types rarely exist in pure form, the actual frames of decision makers will lie between the end points and resemble the ideal types to different degrees (Doty & Glick, 1994). Actual frames thus consist of different combinations of the underlying constructs—that is, frame content and structure—of the two ideal-type frames.\n\nContent. The content of the two frames is defined by the attributes decision makers use when they make sense of ambiguous cues and differs with regard to the dominance and diversity of these attributes. As developed above, the business case frame follows an alignment logic, which puts economic attributes first.1 Social and\n\n1 Alignment can be based on different rationales, depending on which kinds of attributes dominate the content of a cognitive frame. Conceptually speaking, an ecological case frame or a social case frame, where environmental or social attributes dominate, respectively, would also follow an\n\n# Characteristics of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame\n\n|Frame Characteristics|Business Case Frame|Paradoxical Frame|\n|---|---|---|\n|Content|Exclusive focus on business attributes|Combination of multiple attributes with different rationales|\n|Structure|Simple|Complex|\n|Differentiation|Low number of frame elements|High number of frame elements|\n|Integration|Low degree of connectedness with singular focus on economic means-ends relationships|High degree of connectedness with a plurality of reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting relationships|\n|Implicit goal|Improve economic performance at the organizational level|Address economic, environmental, and social concerns at organizational and societal levels|\n|Underlying logic|Business case thinking: Alignment of environmental and social concerns with economic objectives|Paradoxical thinking: Juxtaposition of economic, environmental, and social concerns, even if contradictory|\n|Treatment of tensions|Elimination|Acceptance|\n\nEnvironmental aspects are only taken into account when they can be aligned with financial contradictions (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 533)—to accommodate competing yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns that reside at different levels and operate in different logics and time frames (Byrch et al., 2007; Gao & Bansal, 2013). However, since the paradoxical frame does not systematically emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, it does not offer unequivocal guidance on which aspect of a sustainability issue to prioritize.\n\nStructure. The differences in content and underlying logic between the two frames also influence the frames’ structure, both with regard to the number of salient frame elements (i.e., the degree of differentiation) and the complexity and multitude of connections between these elements (i.e., the degree of integration). For the business case frame, the strong focus on economic attributes results in comparatively low degrees of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is low because the economic focus limits the number of attributes represented. Integration is also low because, owing to its emphasis on aligning environmental and social concerns with financial performance, this frame only considers connections between frame elements that are based on hierarchical means-ends relationships. Other, more complex relations, where social and environmental aspects do not align with financial performance, are not taken into account. However, the consideration of only a limited set of connections does allow managers with a business case frame to eliminate inconsistencies and tensions (Smith & Tushman, 2005).\n\n# Academy of Management Review\n\n# October\n\nLewis, 2011; Weick, 1995) and to reduce com- complexity and ambiguity of the issue (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996). A paradoxical frame has a more complex structure. The inclusiveness of this frame results in a higher degree of differentiation since it accommodates frame elements covering all three sustainability dimensions. While the high degree of differentiation refers to the inclusion of a wide variety of attributes, this frame also has a higher degree of integration since it takes into account different reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting connections between and among sustainability dimensions.\n\n# Relationship Between the Two Frames\n\nAs noted above, the business case frame and the paradoxical frame represent two ideal-type conceptualizations of how managers relate economic, environmental, and social concerns to each other. They represent the end points of a continuum, with a full alignment with economic objectives at the one end and a combination of interrelated yet conflicting economic, environmental, and social concerns at the other end. Although as ideal types the business case frame and the paradoxical frame are distinct, actual frames represent different combinations of content and structure of the two ideal types (see Figure 1). Starting with the business case frame at the one extreme, once a frame starts to include salient environmental and social attributes, in addition to economic attributes, its content gets more diverse and its structure more differentiated (upward move in Figure 1). With the number of frame elements increasing, the number of possible connections between elements grows disproportionately. The higher the number and the greater the diversity of frame elements, the more complex and diverse the interconnections. Hence, the cognitive frame has a higher degree of integration, which will eventually result in the paradoxical frame at the other extreme (rightward move in Figure 1). The more a frame is rooted in an alignment logic (business case frame), the greater its focus but the lower its complexity. In contrast, the more a frame uses paradoxical thinking (paradoxical frame), the higher its complexity but the lower its focus.\n\nWe propose that these two ideal-type frames are useful heuristic devices to understand managerial decision making in a sustainability context. We now develop the consequences of each frame for the process of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS CASE FRAME<|>EVENT<|>The Business Case Frame is a conceptualization that focuses on aligning environmental and social aspects with economic objectives in decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARADOXICAL FRAME<|>EVENT<|>The Paradoxical Frame is a conceptualization that accommodates the interrelated yet contradictory nature of economic, environmental, and social concerns in decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability refers to the ability to meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, encompassing economic, environmental, and social dimensions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESS CASE FRAME<|>PARADOXICAL FRAME<|>The Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame represent two ideal-type conceptualizations of how managers relate economic, environmental, and social concerns to each other<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>BUSINESS CASE FRAME<|>The Business Case Frame is a decision-making approach that aims to improve economic performance while considering sustainability<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>PARADOXICAL FRAME<|>The Paradoxical Frame addresses sustainability by recognizing the complexity and interconnections among economic, environmental, and social dimensions<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
