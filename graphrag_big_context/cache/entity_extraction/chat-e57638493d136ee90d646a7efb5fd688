At the end of 2023, our total full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount in development was 36,444 (2022: 35,280). Measured in FTEs, our R&D headcount increased 1 pp to 34% of total headcount (2022: 33%).\n\nTotal R&D expense not only includes our own personnel costs but also the external costs of work and services from the providers and cooperation partners we work with to deliver and enhance our products. We also incur external costs for the following:\n\n- Translating, localizing, and testing products\n- Obtaining certification for products in different markets\n- Patent attorney services and fees\n- Consulting related to our product strategy\n- Professional development of our R&D workforce\n\n14 Recalculated score according to 2023 methodology.

As at December 31, 2023, SAP held a total of close to 13,000 (2022: close to 13,000) validated patents worldwide. Of these, more than 650 (2022: more than 800) were granted and validated in 2023. While our intellectual property is important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not dependent on any particular patent or a combination of patents.\n\n# Competitive Intangibles\n\nThe majority of (intangible) resources that are the basis for our current as well as future success does not appear in the book value of equity in our Consolidated Financial Statements. This is apparent from a comparison of the market capitalization of SAP SE (based on all issued shares), which was €171.4 billion at the end of 2023 (2022: €118.4 billion), with the book value of our equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which was €43.4 billion (2022: €42.8 billion). This means that the market capitalization of our equity is more than three times higher than the book value.\n\n# Measuring Our Success\n\nWe use the following financial and non-financial objectives to steer our company:\n\n- Growth\n- Profitability\n- Customer loyalty\n- Employee engagement\n- Carbon impact\n\n# Outlook and Results for 2023\n\n|Strategic Objective|KPI|2023 Outlook*|2023 Results|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Growth|Cloud revenue2|€14.0 billion to €14.2 billion|€14.06 billion|\n|Cloud and software revenue2| |€27.0 billion to €27.4 billion|€27.64 billion|\n|Profitability|Operating profit1,2|€8.65 billion to €8.95 billion|€9.04 billion|\n| |Free cash flow|Approx. €4.9 billion|€5.09 billion|\n|Customer Loyalty|Customer Net Promoter Score|8 to 12|9|\n|Employee Engagement|Employee Engagement Index|76% to 80%|80%|\n|Carbon Impact|Net carbon emissions|0 kt|0 kt|\n\n* The 2023 outlook was communicated in January 2023.
