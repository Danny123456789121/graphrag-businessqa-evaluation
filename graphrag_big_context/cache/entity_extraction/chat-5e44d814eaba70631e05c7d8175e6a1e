The Company Law provides the legal requirement for the transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private or listed enterprises. To conform to the two legislations, the stock exchanges in China have implemented guidelines for their listed corporations to take responsibility for their stakeholders. The SZSE issued the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Guidelines for Listed Companies in 2006 and the SSE issued similar guidelines in 2008, and both stock exchanges begin to mandate CSR reporting in a subset of listed companies. However, the guidelines provide limited assistance to companies preparing for their disclosures. The lack of a prescribed reporting framework is, therefore, ambiguous and has led to large variations in reporting practice, such that users find the reports challenging to compare and use for decision-making (Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, sustainability information can be used for window-addressing and causes heterogeneous expectation among investors. The subsequent noise increases stock price volatility and decreases firm values (Orlitzky, 2013). Given the local community in China is in favour for CSD information, particularly under the sustainability promotional strategy by the state government, CSD reporting companies are likely to be inadequately guided by the existent guidelines and generating information that increases the dispersion of the market expectation. However, limited research has examined what is expected from primary stakeholders and how the reporting companies should address such expectations. As such, in this study, we focus on financial analysts’ perceived importance of CSD in the unique institutional setting of China.\n\n# 2. Literature review and hypotheses development\n\n# 2.1 The context of sustainability reporting in China\n\nSustainability reporting, which is also referred to as CSR reporting, focused solely on social issues at its very beginning stage in the early 1960s (Lin, 2010). Elkington (1994) suggested that there are six stages of CSD development, which include ignorance, awakening, denial, guilt reduction, displacement behaviour and tokenism, conversion and finally, integration. This was further extended and re-summarised by Dunphy et al. (2003). They developed more sophisticated concepts for each of the six stages of CSD development, which include rejection, non-responsiveness, compliance, efficiency, strategic proactivity and the sustaining corporation.\n\nAfter the emergence of triple bottom line reporting, the number of companies that issued CSD increased, with different names to show different areas of focus. Reynolds and Yuthas (2008) explained this early stage of reporting sustainability as companies owing the duty to the society in which they are bonded with a social contract.\n\nAccording to Freeman (1984), sustainability reporting is an approach for a company to identify its socially relevant behaviour, determine those to whom the company is accountable for its environmental and social performance and develop appropriate measures and reporting techniques. However, being sustainable or ecologically responsible is defined differently across cultures (Hofstede, 1980).\n\nIn China, CSD is mostly perceived to be a response to external government and public pressures on corporate management (Gao, 2009). The notion of corporate sustainability reporting was first proposed in 2006 in the amendment of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China, Article 5 of the General Law. Later in 2006, in the Chinese Communist Party Sixth Plenary Session, a national plan proposal was made to create a harmonious Chinese society with a focus on being socially responsible, particularly for business enterprises (Gao, 2010).\n\nAs a response to the national plan, the SSE and SZSE issued social reporting guidelines in 2006 and 2008, respectively, to create an appropriate system for corporate sustainability reporting. According to the SSE guidelines Notice for Better Reporting 2008 Annual Reports, a subset of industries that were listed in the Chinese financial market, including the SSE corporate governance sector, firms with shares listed overseas and financial companies, were mandated to prepare CSR reports alongside the annual reports. However, despite the introductions of a number of policies after the two stock exchange markets announced their guidelines, the meaning and definition of corporate sustainability were never specified. The guidelines also did not provide any indication of how to prepare and what to include in a CSD. While the CSR guidelines in China have initiated systematics rule and approaches to report CSR, the coverage and the specificity of the reports are still less comprehensive than those formulated in the Western context (Nornha et al., 2013).\n\nThe board indications from the CSR guidelines in China are provided below:\n\n“Listed companies are encouraged to disclose non-financial information in CSR reports.\n\nNon-financial information should be based on the triple bottom line namely, economic, social and environmental information.\n\nCSR reports should be endorsed by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.\n\nAreas and circumstances in which listed companies should compulsorily disclose environmental information are indicated.\n\nA new concept of social contribution value per share (SCVPS), a ratio used to measure the listed companies.” (Nornha et al., 2013, p. 32)\n\nAs suggested further by Nornha et al. (2013), the reporting companies could choose their own methods to calculate the related ratio under the guidelines, which was subjective and challenging for companies to follow. While the concept of corporate sustainability has become more commonly accepted in China, there has been no agreed-upon definition of it. Therefore, the standardisation and the regulations of corporate sustainability in China are in a great need of development (Bai et al., 2015).\n\n# 2.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines in China\n\nIn China, the GRI (2013) guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reportings. In recent decades, GRI has attempted to provide comprehensive\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
