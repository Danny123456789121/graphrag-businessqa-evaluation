The 11 material topics in this GRI Content Index were selected based on the comprehensive materiality assessment conducted in 2022 and reflect the requirements of GRI 3: Material Topics. We have clustered these topics according to the relevant non-financial matters set out in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) (exception: the material topic “ethics and compliance” is not clustered under “Anti-corruption and bribery matters” as the corresponding GRI standards are defined more broadly).
