The original estimates were developed by examining the development time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed automation solutions, including hardware and software solutions.\n\n# Economic feasibility\n\nOnce a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost of the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this calculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.\n\n# Solution cost evolution\n\nBased on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware and software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross motor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as a software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. We estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using different mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions have relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that require a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. To be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only from very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality and efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 to 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to 20 percent for software.\n\nIn our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs decline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. We triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in hardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to estimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer price index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software and accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution costs, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual reductions have little impact on final automation results.\n\n# Wage evolution\n\nWe model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply country-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US dollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 base) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for each country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which we have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage distribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We reclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate growth rate is applied.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Adoption and deployment\n\nAdoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors can hinder or enable the timing and the pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different technologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities into current technical platforms and combine them into an organic entity. Barriers also exist on the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks to implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology innovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have varied levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.\n\nTo incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-known and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting and technology forecasting.\n\n1-F(t) = (p + qF(t)) f(t)\n\nF(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and f(t) is the corresponding rate of change.\n\nThe function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (the inherent tendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of consumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary least square regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta analyses can be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.\n\nWe then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The technologies we used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking systems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, electronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers.
