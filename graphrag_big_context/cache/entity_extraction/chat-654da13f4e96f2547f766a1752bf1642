Consequently, this line item primarily includes employee expenses relating to these services, amortization of acquired intangibles, fees for third-party licenses, depreciation of our property, plant, and equipment (for example, of our data centers in which we host our cloud solutions), and costs for third-party hosting services. For more information about the capitalization of costs from contracts with customers, see Note (A.3).\n\n# Updated Cost Allocation Policy\n\nStarting January 1, 2023, all activities related to changes in the code of SAPâ€™s cloud and on-premise solutions are treated as development-related activities. Some of those activities, specifically code corrections, were previously considered as support-related activities. SAP believes that this update aligns SAPâ€™s accounting policy with market standards and increases comparability to its peers. For the full year 2023, the update of our cost allocation policy led to an increase in the cloud gross profit of approximately â‚¬95 million (2022: â‚¬88 million, 2021: â‚¬61 million), an increase in the software license and support gross profit of approximately â‚¬275 million (2022: â‚¬310 million, 2021: â‚¬326 million), and an increase in our research & development (R&D) expenses of approximately â‚¬370 million (2022: â‚¬398 million, 2021: â‚¬388 million). Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the updated cost allocation policy.\n\n# Cost of Services\n\nCost of services includes the costs incurred in providing the services that generate service revenue. Consequently, this line item primarily includes employee expenses and related training, system and system administration costs, and costs for third-party resources.\n\n# Research and Development\n\nResearch and development includes the costs incurred by activities related to the development of cloud and software solutions including resource and hardware costs for the development systems. The same applies for all activities related to changes in the code of SAPâ€™s cloud and software solutions. For more information about the recognition of internally generated intangible assets from development, see Note (D.3). Please also note the Updated Cost Allocation Policy above.\n\n160/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing includes the costs incurred for the selling activities (such as sales commissions and amortization of capitalized sales commissions) and marketing activities related to our software and cloud solutions and our service portfolio. For more information about the capitalization of costs from contracts with customers, see Note (A.3).\n\n# General and Administration\n\nGeneral and administration includes the costs related to finance and administrative functions, human resources, and general management as long as they are not directly attributable to one of the other operating expense line items.\n\n# Management Judgments and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent liabilities.\n\nWe base our judgments, estimates, and assumptions on historical and forecast information, and on regional and industry economic conditions in which we or our customers operate. Changes to these conditions could adversely affect our estimates. Although we believe we have made reasonable estimates about the ultimate resolution of the underlying uncertainties, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be consistent with what is reflected in our recognized assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and disclosed contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from original estimates.\n\nThe accounting policies that most frequently or significantly require us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, include the following:\n\n|Note|Material Accounting Policies|\n|---|---|\n|(A.1)|Revenue recognition|\n|(A.2)|Valuation of trade receivables|\n|(A.4), (G.3)|Accounting for legal contingencies|\n|(B.3)|Accounting for share-based payments|\n|(C.5)|Accounting for income taxes|\n|(D.1)|Accounting for business combinations|\n|(D.2)|Accounting for goodwill|\n|(D.3)|Accounting for intangible assets (including recognition of internally generated intangible assets from development)|\n|(D.6)|Accounting for equity investments|\n\nOur management periodically discusses these material accounting policies with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Supervisory Board.\n\n# New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nThe IASB has issued various amendments to the IFRS standards (such as IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements), IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows), IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments Disclosure), and IFRS 16 (Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback Transaction)) that are relevant for SAP but not yet effective. We are currently assessing the impact on SAP, but do not expect material effects on our financial position or profit after tax.\n\n161/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
