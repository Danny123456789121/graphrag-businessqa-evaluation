In exceptional cases and limited economic environments, operating transactions are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, leading to a foreign currency exchange rate risk for the related monetary instruments. Where material, this foreign currency exchange rate risk is hedged. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates only have an impact on profit with regard to our unhedged non-derivative monetary financial instruments and related income or expenses.\n- Our free-standing derivatives designed for hedging foreign currency exchange rate risks almost completely balance the changes in the fair values of the hedged item attributable to exchange rate movements in the Consolidated Income Statements in the same period. As a consequence, the hedged items and the hedging instruments are not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, and thereby have no effect on profit.\n\nConsequently, we are only exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with regard to the following:\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– The spot component of derivatives held within a designated cash flow hedge relationship affecting other comprehensive income\n\n– Foreign currency embedded derivatives affecting other non-operating expense, net\n\n– Unhedged foreign-currency monetary assets and liabilities affecting other non-operating expense, net\n\nThus, our foreign currency exposure (and our average/high/low exposure) as at December 31 was as follows:\n\n# Foreign Currency Exposure\n\n|€ billions|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Year-end exposure toward all our major currencies|4.2|1.7|\n|Average exposure|3.3|1.6|\n|Highest exposure|4.2|1.7|\n|Lowest exposure|2.5|1.3|\n\n# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Sensitivity\n\nIf, on December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the foreign currency exchange rates had been higher/lower as described below, this would have had the following effects on other non-operating expense, net and other comprehensive income:\n\n# Foreign Currency Sensitivity\n\n|€ millions|Effects on Other Non-Operating Expense, Net|Effects on Other Comprehensive Income|\n|---|---|---|\n|Derivatives held within a designated cash flow hedge relationship| | |\n|All major currencies –10% (2022: all major currencies –10%; 2021: all major currencies –10%) against the euro|238| |\n|All major currencies +10% (2022: all major currencies +10%; 2021: all major currencies +10%) against the euro|–238| |\n|Thereof: USD –10% (2022: –10%; 2021: –10%) against the euro|131| |\n|Thereof: USD +10% (2022: +10%; 2021: +10%) against the euro|–131| |\n|Embedded derivatives| | |\n|All currencies –10% against the respective functional currency|–63| |\n|All currencies +10% against the respective functional currency|64| |\n|Thereof: EUR –10% (2022: –10%; 2021: –10%) against the respective functional currency|–48| |\n|Thereof: EUR +10% (2022: +10%; 2021: +10%) against the respective functional currency|48| |\n|Unhedged monetary assets and liabilities| | |\n|All currencies –10% against the respective functional currency|–112| |\n|All currencies +10% against the respective functional\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The SAP Group is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EURO<|>GEO<|>The Euro is the official currency of the Eurozone, used by 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USD<|>GEO<|>The United States Dollar is the official currency of the United States and is widely used as a global reserve currency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE<|>EVENT<|>Foreign currency exchange rate refers to the value of one currency for the purpose of conversion to another, which can impact financial statements and operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Consolidated Income Statements are financial statements that present the revenues, expenses, and profits of a company and its subsidiaries.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>EURO<|>SAP Group operates in the Eurozone and is exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>USD<|>SAP Group operates in the United States and is exposed to fluctuations in the USD exchange rate<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE<|>CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS<|>Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact the figures reported in the Consolidated Income Statements<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
