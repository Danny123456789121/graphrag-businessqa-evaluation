SAP acknowledges that every organization’s experience with the cloud can be unique and can therefore be challenging, yet many customers who have made the shift to a cloud strategy can use the benefits that today’s business environments require, such as the ability to redistribute resources previously required for managing internal IT teams, and remote global accessibility from any location through an Internet connection regardless of where teams are located around the world. This strategy-shift to the cloud allows SAP to address these new market opportunities and requirements.\n\n# The strategic pillars of SAP’s product strategy and our development and innovations are presented below.\n\n# Cloud ERP\n\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud provides software capabilities mainly for finance, risk management, project management, procurement, manufacturing, supply chain management, asset management, and research and development.
