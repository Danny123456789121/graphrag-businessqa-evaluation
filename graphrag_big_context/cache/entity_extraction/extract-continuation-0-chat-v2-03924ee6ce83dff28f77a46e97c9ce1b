In some cases, workers will stay in the same occupations, but their mix of activities will shift; in others, workers will need to shift occupations.\n\n# Exhibit 15\n\nGenerative AI could contribute to productivity growth if labor hours can be redeployed effectively.\n\n|Productivity impact from automation by scenario, 2022–40, CAGR, %|Without generative AI|Additional with generative AI|\n|---|---|---|\n|Global|3.4|0.6|\n|Developed economies| | |\n|Japan|3.7|0.7|\n|Germany|3.8|0.7|\n|France|3.7|0.6|\n|United States|3.8|0.7|\n|Emerging economies| | |\n|China|3.6|0.6|\n|Mexico|3.4| |\n|India|3.1|0.5|\n|South Africa|2.9|0.4|\n\nNote: Figures may not sum, because of rounding.\n\nBased on the assumption that automated work hours are reintegrated in work at productivity level of today.\n\nPrevious assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\nBased on 47 countries, representing about 80% of world employment.\n\nSource: Conference Board Total Economy Database; Oxford Economics; McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nThe capabilities of generative AI vastly expand the pool of work activities with the potential for technical automation. That in turn has sped up the pace at which automation may be deployed and expanded the types of workers who will experience its impact. Like other technologies, its ability to take on routine tasks and work can increase human productivity, which has grown at a below-average rate for almost 20 years. It can also offset the impact of aging, which is beginning to put a dent in workforce growth for many of the world’s major economies. But to achieve these benefits, a significant number of workers will need to substantially change the work they do, either in their existing occupations or in new ones. They will also need support in making transitions to new activities.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n47\n\n# Considerations for businesses and society\n\nHistory has shown that new technologies have the potential to reshape societies. Artificial intelligence has already changed the way we live and work—for example, it can help our phones (mostly) understand what we say, or draft emails. Mostly, however, AI has remained behind the scenes, optimizing business processes or making recommendations about the next product to buy. The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment the impact of AI overall, generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and transforming the nature of work.\n\nBut the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must act—and quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to address both the opportunities and the risks. Risks have already surfaced, including concerns about the content that generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual property due to “plagiarism” in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the answers that LLMs produce when questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will the content generative AI creates be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, producing content that reflects harmful stereotypes?\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nThere are economic challenges too: the scale and the scope of the workforce transitions described in this report are considerable. In the midpoint adoption scenario, about a quarter to a third of work activities could change in the coming decade. The task before us is to manage the potential positives and negatives of the technology simultaneously (for more about the potential risks of generative AI, see Box 5). Here are some of the critical questions we will need to address while balancing our enthusiasm for the potential benefits of the technology with the new challenges it can introduce.\n\n# Box 5\n\n# Using generative AI responsibly\n\nGenerative AI poses a variety of risks. Stakeholders will want to address these risks from the start.\n\n- Fairness: Models may generate algorithmic bias due to imperfect training data or decisions made by the engineers developing the models.\n- Intellectual property (IP): Training data and model outputs can generate significant IP risks, including infringing on copyrighted, trademarked, patented, or otherwise legally protected materials. Even when using a provider’s generative AI tool, organizations will need to understand what data went into training and how it’s used in tool outputs.\n- Privacy: Privacy concerns could arise if users input information that later ends up in model outputs in a form that makes individuals identifiable. Generative AI could also be used to create and disseminate malicious content such as disinformation, deepfakes, and hate speech.\n- Security: Generative AI may be used by bad actors to accelerate the sophistication and speed of cyberattacks. It also can be manipulated to provide malicious outputs. For example, through a technique called prompt injection, a third party gives a model new instructions that trick the model into delivering an output unintended by the model producer and end user.\n- Reliability: Models can produce different answers to the same prompts, impeding the user’s ability to assess the accuracy and reliability of outputs.\n- Organizational impact: Generative AI may significantly affect the workforce, and the impact on specific groups and local communities could be disproportionately negative.\n- Social and environmental impact: The\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that analyzes economic trends and provides insights on the impact of technologies like generative AI on productivity and workforce transitions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can create content and automate tasks, significantly impacting productivity and the nature of work.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is a developed economy that is experiencing productivity growth influenced by automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is a developed economy noted for its productivity growth, which is also affected by automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is a developed economy that is part of the analysis regarding productivity growth and the impact of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a developed economy that is experiencing productivity growth influenced by automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is an emerging economy that is analyzed for its productivity growth in relation to automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEXICO<|>GEO<|>Mexico is an emerging economy that is part of the productivity growth analysis concerning automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is an emerging economy that is experiencing productivity growth influenced by automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>GEO<|>South Africa is an emerging economy that is analyzed for its productivity growth in relation to automation and generative AI.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>McKinsey & Company analyzes the economic potential and productivity impact of generative AI technologies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPAN<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Japan's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMANY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Germany's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>France's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The United States' productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>China's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEXICO<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Mexico's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>India's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>South Africa's productivity growth is influenced by the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
