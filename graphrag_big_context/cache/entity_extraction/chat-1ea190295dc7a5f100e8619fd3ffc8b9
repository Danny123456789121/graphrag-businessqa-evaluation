It is the reaction that powers the stars of the universe. But huge breakthroughs will be required for it to become cost effective and scalable. A critical aspect of fusion research involves learning how to control and sustain a hydrogen “plasma” that is hotter than the core of the sun. One tool researchers use is a tokamak, a doughnut-shaped vacuum that aims to contain the plasma by making thousands of adjustments per second to a set of powerful magnetic coils. The magnets seek to keep the plasma from touching the vessel walls, which would, at a minimum, dissipate heat, or worse, damage the tokamak. Since the world’s tokamaks are in high demand, one way to advance and accelerate fusion research is through simulation.\n\nA collaboration of Google DeepMind and the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL, a Swiss research university, has leveraged AI to create the first deep reinforcement learning system for fusion research. It simulates EPFL’s Variable Configuration Tokamak (TCV) and has successfully modeled ways to stabilize and sculpt plasma that have subsequently been validated in the actual TCV—opening new avenues to advance nuclear fusion research.\n\n# Application area: Innovation and Breakthroughs\n\n# Navigating AI’s Potential Risks\n\nAs governments and businesses increasingly rely on AI to help mitigate emissions, build resilience, and adapt to a changing climate, a critical question arises: what risks are associated with the rise of AI? Understanding and navigating these risks is essential if we are to scale AI responsibly and manage its environmental footprint. GHG emissions, water, and waste management are three key areas that will be addressed in this chapter.\n\n# Issue 1: AI’s Energy-Related GHG Emissions\n\nIn 2022, global data center electricity consumption accounted for 1.0% to 1.3% of global final electricity demand. Further, a 2022 paper in Nature Climate Change estimates that cloud and hyperscale data centers are responsible for 0.1% to 0.2% of global GHG emissions and that roughly 25% of their workloads are related to machine learning. A critical question is how—with AI at the start of a new innovation and adoption curve—data center electricity use and related GHG emissions will evolve going forward. There is a critical need for more deep research on this topic, but at this stage, we can make some important observations.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP\n\nGOOGLE\n\nHistorically, data center energy consumption has grown much more slowly than demand for computing power. Between 2015 and 2018, for example, the IEA reports that data center electricity use was flat despite a doubling of compute demand and tripling of internet traffic. Furthermore, a paper in Science reports that between 2010 and 2018—a period during which data center compute demand increased sixfold and internet traffic tenfold—data center electricity use grew just 6% as a result of a shift from inefficient on-premises data centers to the highly energy-optimized cloud. And we still have optimization potential in the future. In 2022, the average annual power usage effectiveness for Google’s global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55.\n\nLooking forward, Exhibit 4 illustrates the key drivers of AI’s electricity use and GHG emissions throughout its life cycle. At the level of the grid, emissions will be determined by the power sources selected to power a data center and the efficiency of the distribution system. Compute machines and data center design choices also can have a powerful influence. The choice of more energy-efficient servers optimized for AI models can make a significant difference. AI model developers can be more mindful of the energy intensity of their programming choices. And a critical unknown is how quickly and how much end-user demand for AI-enabled products and services increases compute demand.\n\nSo how might these factors evolve? A 2022 paper by researchers from UC Berkeley and Google, which studied the energy requirements for machine learning training, identifies four best practices with the potential to reduce energy use and emissions. Let’s take each in turn:\n\n- Energy Source Carbon Intensity. In data center emissions profiles, such as in real estate, location matters. In 2022, Norway’s electric grid had an average carbon intensity of 29 g CO2e/kWh, compared with an average of 102 in Brazil, 367 in the US, 489 in Singapore, and 709 in South Africa. And even within a country, the share of carbon-free energy can vary significantly from region to region—meaning that many organizations operate in jurisdictions without easy access to clean energy. And while trade associations such as the Clean Energy Buyers Association, RE-Source, and the Asia Clean Energy Coalition are working to increase access, changes are still needed.\n- Other choices matter too. Information and communications technology (ICT) companies have led the world in adopting renewable energy power\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
