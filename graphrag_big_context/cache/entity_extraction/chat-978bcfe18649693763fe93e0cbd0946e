Although we continue to be mindful of the negative aspects of this global situation, we take opportunities to further invest into our strategic growth areas. For more information about future trends in the global economy and the IT market outlook, as well as their potential influence on SAP, see the beginning of this Expected Developments and Opportunities section.\n\n# Opportunities Through Innovation\n\nOur continued growth through innovation is based on our ability to leverage research and development (R&D) resources effectively. We are accelerating innovation cycles, especially in our cloud solutions, and engaging even more closely with our customers to enable success. Specifically, we focus on ease of adoption and consumption so customers can receive the benefits from our software solutions, technologies, and platforms at reduced time to value.\n\nOur aim is to bring our customers into a clean core in the cloud based on SAP S/4HANA Cloud and enabled by our SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), which provides the required extensibilities and thereby creates connectivity between our solutions. This clean core is intended to enable multicloud adoption from our customers and partners.\n\nTo address new and critical environmental, economic, and social challenges, SAP embeds SAP Business AI capabilities across our entire portfolio, a step we believe will increase customer demand. In addition, SAP Business AI has the potential to simplify how people interact with SAP solutions, and to increase the addressable user base.\n\nBased on our innovation capabilities, we see opportunities to drive customer value by shaping the future of business processes with next-generation, modular, industry-specific solutions that enhance companies’ existing systems. Designed to drive unprecedented business agility, forge the future of business collaboration, and enable companies to manage operations seamlessly within and beyond organizational boundaries, said solutions are pioneering the future of data-driven decision-making, empowering businesses to act boldly and with greater confidence. These enhancements could also lead to increased demand across our cloud portfolio. For example, the accelerated adoption of technology that helps companies take more sustainable decisions and that we natively build in our SAP S/4HANA Cloud could result in additional upsell opportunities for customers migrating to cloud ERP.\n\nWe also see high growth potential in four adjacent innovation areas: sustainability management, working capital management (accelerated through the Taulia portfolio), business networks, business transformation solutions (accelerated through the SAP Signavio portfolio and LeanIX solutions) that help us deliver on our vision and commitments to help customers reach agility at scale, achieve more across the value chain, and become sustainable at their core.\n\nIn addition, we continue to expand startup engagement in strategic opportunity areas, focusing on startups as customers and partners. For more information about future opportunities in research and development for SAP, see the Strategy and Business Model section.\n\n# Opportunities from Our Strategy for Profitable Growth\n\nSAP strives to generate profitable growth across our portfolio of products, solutions, and services to keep and improve our market position. Our aim is to continue to expand our addressable market by enhancing our portfolio and our new technologies and innovations. As an industry, we are benefiting from a secular trend toward digitalization, cloud, and the rise of AI, and are strengthening the market’s readiness to consume software in the cloud, including core business process platforms.\n\nTo positively affect the profitability of our cloud business, we set clear priorities to optimize efficiency in our cloud operations. Our operational excellence priorities include a focus on adoption and consumption of our product portfolio, leading to more efficient sales and marketing invest; a focused product portfolio leading to more effective R&D investment; more centralized business operations.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nleading to end-to-end-optimization; and an accelerated workforce transformation leading to a future-ready workforce.\n\nSAP seeks to establish new business models and leverage its expanding ecosystem of partners to achieve scale and maximize opportunities. Building on our success with RISE with SAP, we are moving toward expansion and have launched Grow with SAP, a dedicated offering for midmarket companies that is helping us win net-new customers.\n\nNew commercial models such as RISE Premium Plus increase the focus on packaged suite sales and flexible consumption, making sure we capture the significant cross-sell potential of our suite while decreasing cost of sales for the acquisition of net-new customers and increasing customer lifetime value with existing customers.\n\nOur strong focus on technical integration between our line-of-business (LoB) solutions and SAP S/4HANA, to provide a seamless and delightful experience for our customers, may uplift the cross-sell potential of our suite portfolio and create operational synergies.\n\nTo further drive the aforementioned opportunities, SAP announced a transformation program for 2024 to focus on key strategic growth areas, in particular business AI. Through this program, SAP intends to transform its operational setup to capture organizational synergies and AI-driven efficiencies, and to prepare the Company for highly scalable future revenue growth.\n\n# Opportunities from Our Ecosystem\n\nSAP’s ecosystem is defined by the interdependent relationships of our customers, our employees, our suppliers, our partners, and our complementary technology partners. Our ecosystem, which includes more than 25,000 partners with different areas of expertise, carries the SAP brand into global markets and expands our portfolio with their expertise, services, and solutions.\n\nOur ecosystem includes partners in four different tracks: partners in the “Build” track develop solutions on top of, or integrate with, SAP technology and platforms; extending the scope and functionality of SAP solutions to address customer requirements; partners in the “Sell” track advise, resell, implement, and support customers of all types and sizes; partners in the “Service” track (systems integrators) provide strategic business consulting, system design, solution integration, and project implementation of SAP solutions; partners in the “Run” track are outsourcing or hosting companies that offer\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
