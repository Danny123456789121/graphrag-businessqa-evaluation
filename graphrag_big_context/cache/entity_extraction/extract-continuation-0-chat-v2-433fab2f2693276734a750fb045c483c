The Code contains statutory requirements and a number of recommendations and suggestions. Only the legal requirements are binding for German companies. With regard to the recommendations, the German Stock Corporation Act, section 161, requires that every year, listed companies publicly state the extent to which they have implemented them. Companies can deviate from the suggestions without having to make any public statements.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of SAP SE issued the required declarations of compliance. The declaration for 2023 was issued at the end of October 2023.

For 2023, that report is as follows:\n\nThe management of SAP is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SAP’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of SAP’s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nSAP’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).\n\nBased on the assessment under these criteria, SAP management has concluded that, as at December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n\n258/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# About This Further Information on Economic, Environmental, and Social Performance\n\n260\n\n# Sustainability Management\n\n261\n\n# Stakeholder Engagement\n\n263\n\n# Materiality\n\n265\n\n# Why Holistic Steering and Reporting Matters\n\n268\n\n# Social Investments\n\n271\n\n# Sustainable Procurement\n\n273\n\n# Waste and Water\n\n276\n\n# Public Policy\n\n279\n\n# Memberships, Partnerships, and Commitments\n\n280\n\n# Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance\n\n282\n\n# Our Contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\n292\n\n# GRI Content Index\n\n296\n\n# Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics\n\n311\n\n# SASB Index\n\n313\n\n# Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)\n\n314\n\n259/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# About This Further Information on Economic, Environmental, and Social Performance\n\nThe social and environmental data and information included in the SAP Integrated Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards and were subject to an independent assurance engagement of our external auditor with different levels of assurance.
