Since the beginning of 2020, these annual targets have been integrated in the Executive Boardâ€™s short-term performance-based compensation. â€¢ Status: Achieved.|\n|2023: 6.9 million tons gross carbon emissions (market-based)|2030: reduction by 90% (near-term and long-term target)|â€¢ Acceleration of SAPâ€™s science-based target (to reach net zero across our value chain in line with a 1.5Â°C future by 2030, 20 years earlier than originally planned) required a reassessment of the baseline, underlying scopes, calculation methodologies, and the target pathway. â€¢ Status and next steps: &nbsp;&nbsp;o In 2023, our original SBT was replaced by our commitment to reach net zero by 2030 in line with the SBTi Corporate Net-Zero Standard. &nbsp;&nbsp;o In line with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, we revised the baseline, which includes scope 1, scope 2 market-based, and all business-relevant scope 3 value chain emissions. For more information, see the Non-Financial Notes section. &nbsp;&nbsp;o Next steps: submission to the SBTi in 2024 and publication of target pathway 2024â€“2030 in the SAP Integrated Report 2024.| |\n\n# Performance and Measures to Progress\n\nWith our net carbon emissions dropping to 0 kilotons (kt) in 2023 (2022: 85 kt), we have achieved our carbon neutrality commitment within the targeted timeframe. To achieve our target, we continued and expanded existing initiatives and programs to drive efficiency and innovation, following our strategic approach to first avoid, secondly reduce, and thirdly â€“ if no other option is feasible â€“ compensate for residual emissions by investing in high-quality offset projects certified by international standards. Starting in 2024, we will shift toward reporting on our new leading environmental target of â€˜net zero across our entire value chain by 2030.â€™\n\nWe account and report all our carbon emissions in CO2 equivalents (CO2e).\n\nTo see which emission categories are considered in our carbon neutral target, see section Non-Financial Information: Environmental Performance.\n\nLink leads to information that was part of the compensation report audit of our external auditor (reasonable assurance level).\n\nIn the Report Data Hub, we provide a carbon emissions breakdown and more details on progress.\n\nAcceleration decision made in 2022 to prevent and mitigate the intensifying adverse effects of climate change.\n\nConfirmed by the SBTi in a 2019 reassessment, our original 1.5Â°C-aligned SBT aimed for a reduction of 85% by 2050 compared to the base-year level 2016 (near-term target: reduction by 40% by 2025).\n\nLink leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor included in the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\nIn the Report Data Hub, we provide more details about our environmental data.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Total Net Carbon Emissions Kilotons CO2e\n\n| |2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Emissions|300|135|110|85|0|\n|Change| |-3%|-19%|-23%|-55%|\n\nAfter post-COVID-19 catch-up effects and a corresponding increase in 2022, total energy consumption in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a global cloud services organization that designs and operates facilities based on environmental standards and aims for carbon neutrality in its operations by 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 14001:2015<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ISO 14001:2015 is an international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a certification program for the design and operation of high-performance green buildings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEO<|>PERSON<|>The CEO is responsible for guiding SAP's efforts to improve ecological footprint and ensure compliance with sustainability standards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Stakeholder Engagement refers to SAP's regular engagement with various groups such as NGOs, investors, customers, and academia to innovate and evolve sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global Environmental Policy provides the framework for managing SAP's environmental impact and was updated in August 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBTi<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is an organization that helps companies set science-based emissions reduction targets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON NEUTRALITY<|>EVENT<|>Carbon neutrality is SAP's commitment to achieve zero net carbon emissions in its operations by 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|>EVENT<|>Net zero refers to SAP's new leading environmental target to achieve net zero across its entire value chain by 2030.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEO<|>SAP<|>The CEO guides SAP's sustainability efforts and oversees the implementation of the Global Environmental Policy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>ISO 14001:2015<|>SAP's facilities management team designs operations based on ISO 14001:2015 environmental standards<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>LEED<|>SAP operates many facilities that are certified under the LEED program for energy and environmental design<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY<|>The Global Environmental Policy guides SAP's efforts to manage its environmental impact<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>SBTi<|>SAP's carbon reduction targets are confirmed by the SBTi, which helps set science-based targets<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON NEUTRALITY<|>SAP<|>SAP achieved carbon neutrality in its operations by 2023 as part of its sustainability commitment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NET ZERO<|>SAP<|>SAP aims to achieve net zero across its entire value chain by 2030, following its carbon neutrality commitment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT<|>SAP<|>SAP regularly engages with stakeholders to innovate and evolve its sustainability practices<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
