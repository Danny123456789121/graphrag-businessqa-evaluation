For more information about leases, see Note (D.5).\n\n# (D.5) Leases\n\nAccounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\n\nUnder IFRS 16, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, SAP recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis and interest expense is recognized on the lease liabilities. The vast majority of our leases consist of facility and data center leases. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain.\n\n# Leases in the Balance Sheet\n\n|€ millions|12/31/2023|12/31/2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Right-of-use assets| | |\n|Right-of-use assets – land and buildings|1,320|1,758|\n|Right-of-use assets – other property, plant, and equipment|55|43|\n|Total right-of-use assets|1,375|1,801|\n|Property, plant, and equipment|4,276|4,934|\n|Right-of-use assets as % of Property, plant, and equipment|32|37|\n\n# Lease liabilities\n\n|€ millions|12/31/2023|12/31/2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Current lease liabilities|294|349|\n|Current financial liabilities|1,735|4,808|\n|Current lease liabilities as % of Current financial liabilities|17|7|\n|Non-current lease liabilities|1,327|1,791|\n|Non-current financial liabilities|7,941|9,547|\n|Non-current lease liabilities as % of Non-current financial liabilities|17|19|\n\nSAP is committed to future minimum lease payments in the amount of €37 million (2022: €49 million) for facility leases that had not yet commenced as at December 31, 2023.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Leases in the Income Statement\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Lease expenses within operating profit| | |\n|Depreciation of right-of-use assets|325|397|\n\nFor more information about right-of-use asset additions, see Note (D.4), and for a maturity analysis of lease liabilities, see Note (F.1). For more information about the cash flow related to lease liabilities, see the “Reconciliation of Liabilities Arising from Financing Activities” table within Note (E.3).\n\n# (D.6) Equity Investments\n\n# Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\n\nAs we do not designate financial assets as “at fair value through profit or loss,” we generally classify financial assets into the following categories: at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the contractual cash flows of and our business model for holding the respective asset.\n\nFor equity securities, as the cash flow characteristics are other than solely principal and interest, we take an investment-by-investment decision whether to classify as FVTPL or FVOCI.\n\nThe valuation of equity securities of private companies requires judgment because it is typically based on significant unobservable inputs, as no market prices are available and there is inherent lack of liquidity.\n\nWe take the most recent qualitative and quantitative information aspects into consideration to determine the fair value estimates of these equity securities.\n\nConsiderable judgment and assumptions are involved with\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
