(“Qualtrics”), a U.S.-listed company. The Executive Board and the Finance and Investment Committee explained the economic background of this move to us. In preparation for this meeting, we obtained written answers to questions the Supervisory Board members had submitted in advance regarding the sale of Qualtrics. We ultimately approved the divestiture on recommendation of the Finance and Investment Committee.\n\n# Meeting in April\n\nOn April 13, 2023, we discussed the aforementioned key topics as well as business in the first quarter, the Executive Board reporting particularly on SAP’s competitive position and on the current tasks in the individual Executive Board portfolios.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Extraordinary Meeting in May\n\nThe Supervisory Board held an extraordinary meeting following the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 11, 2023. After welcoming the newly-elected member Punit Renjen, we appointed him as second deputy chairperson of the Supervisory Board and, due to the new election or re-election of the Supervisory Board members concerned, approved the proposed changes to the composition of the committees. The Executive Board then explained to us the planned adjustments to the Company’s 2025 financial ambition, which was announced at the SAP Sapphire customer event in Orlando, and the expectations of investors in this regard. Next, the Executive Board presented its proposal to establish a €5 billion share buyback program that would run until the end of 2025. According to the proposal, the program would be carried out on the basis of the appropriate authorization by the Annual General Meeting, and various intra-group financing measures would be undertaken to implement it. After joint deliberation, we approved the Executive Board’s proposal. As the last item on the agenda, we discussed how to deal with potential fines against SAP in connection with ongoing compliance investigations, when it came to the compensation of the Executive Board members currently in office. We particularly took into account that the compliance incidents in question had occurred before the current members of the Executive Board were appointed. The Supervisory Board’s investigations into these compliance incidents therefore do not pertain to current Executive Board members.\n\n# Meeting in July\n\nAs previously mentioned above, AI was a key topic in our July meeting. The Executive Board also reported on business in the second quarter, and we discussed with management potential markets to focus on in future and various marketing-related matters. Next, an analyst from a U.S. investment management company explained the difference between SAP and other major software companies from his perspective as an analyst and the main criteria he used to arrive at this opinion. Based on this information, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board then discussed the strategic direction of the Company with the goal of better meeting the capital markets’ expectations. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the law firm tasked by the Supervisory Board updated us on the ongoing compliance matters, particularly the negotiations with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and informed us on how to proceed. We also approved an amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board to include rules on dealing with conflicts of interests, and passed two resolutions on Executive Board compensation serving to neutralize the impact of the Qualtrics sale on the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the STI 2023 and for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 tranches of the LTI 2020.\n\n# Meeting in October\n\nAt our meeting on October 26, 2023, the individual Executive Board members first reported on business performance in the third quarter for their respective Board area. Next, we took an in-depth look at SAP’s transformation, focusing on the goals, the measures planned by the Executive Board to improve the process, and the new structure of responsibilities at Executive Board level. The Supervisory Board thereafter discussed various HR and compensation matters without the Executive Board being present. Topics notably included the adjustment of Executive Board service contracts to the new compensation system, and the adoption of a clawback policy, which standardizes the cases in which the Company can reclaim variable compensation already paid out to certain top executives, including members of the Executive Board. SAP was required to adopt and implement this directive by December 31, 2023, due to new regulations of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Going forward, the new clawback policy will complement the clawback provisions that already exist in the Executive Board contracts. We then dealt with the regular review of the independence of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Based on the findings from our own examination, we determined that all shareholder representatives were independent in the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and were therefore to be named as such in the Corporate Governance Statement. We also ascertained – in accordance with the recommendations in the GCGC – that more than half of the shareholder representatives are independent from the Company and the Executive Board. Thereafter, we resolved on what we believe to be the appropriate number of independent shareholder representative members, and determined that the Supervisory\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nBoard has an appropriate number of independent members in the meaning of the GCGC, also when the shareholder structure is taken into account. Lastly, the Supervisory Board adopted the regular declaration of compliance and approved an amendment to the non-IFRS definition for the financial year 2024.\n\n# Extraordinary Meeting in December\n\nAn extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting was held on\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
