Some dissipate quickly, while others form into persistent contrail-cirrus clouds that can last for hours, trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space.\n\nTo mitigate this, Google Research teamed up with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to combine AI and huge amounts of data to predict where contrails will form and how planes can avoid making them.\n\nThe trial reduced contrails by 54% across 70 live American Airlines flights. As part of the initiative, American Airlines integrated contrail-likely zones into the tablets their pilots used, enabling them to make in-flight altitude adjustments to avoid creating contrails, just as they do to avoid turbulence.\n\nIn October 2023, a new partnership was announced with EUROCONTROL’s air traffic control center that manages the airspace over Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and northwest Germany—one of the busiest airspaces in the world. With this partnership, EUROCONTROL will be able to provide aircraft flying through its airspace with information about how to avoid making contrails.\n\n# Application area: Enabling Emissions Reduction\n\n|Contrails detected over the United States|2023-03-31|Dd|13:00|14:00|15:00|16:00|17:00|18:00|19:00|20:00|21:00|22:00|23:00|00:00|01:00|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | | | | | | | | | | |AN| | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | |GOLs 16| | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | |A0 L0JS| | |\n\nSource: How AI is helping airlines mitigate the climate impact of contrails, Google Blog, August 2023.

The captured CO2 can then be stored underground in, for example, saline aquifers—or prepared for industrial applications. This technology currently faces questions about its energy efficiency, which may hinder scalability, but ongoing research and development efforts may resolve these challenges. Another approach is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, which generates energy from biomass such as wood and agricultural waste and captures the resulting CO2 for underground storage or industrial use. AI can play a role in assessing optimal capture and storage locations, monitoring for potential leaks, and optimizing the industrial processes and materials used in carbon capture.\n\n# AI as an Enabler of Adaptation and Resilience\n\nEven if mitigation efforts enable us to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C, communities will need to adapt and build resilience to the consequences of a warming planet. AI-driven solutions can play a critical role in two specific areas: predicting hazards and managing vulnerability.\n\n# Hazard Prediction\n\nSome climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, are slow moving. Others, such as flooding, are fast. The incidence of extreme weather events—for example, heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and severe storms—is increasing. A CDP analysis estimates that S&P 500 companies face a potential $40 billion to $50 billion impact from physical climate risks by 2026. In light of that, government and business leaders need to double down on preparation—and AI can make a significant difference in two areas: enabling early warning and projecting long-term trends.\n\n# Projecting Long-Term Trends\n\nThe impacts of climate change vary across regions and cities due to the complex interplay of local geography, weather patterns, ocean currents, and other variables. AI can play a pivotal role in developing powerful climate models that can anticipate adverse impacts such as rising sea levels and drought—and assessing their implications for local communities on factors such as economic development, infrastructure, and agricultural and fishing output. These insights enable the development of thoughtful resilience strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\n# Vulnerability Management\n\nPrediction is undeniably a crucial aspect of preparedness; however, it should be complemented by proactive efforts at the local level to fortify communities against both sudden and protracted crises. AI is showing significant promise in helping manage crises and build forward resilience for physical infrastructure and living creatures.\n\n# Responding to Crises\n\nWhen a crisis strikes, it is incredibly valuable to have tools that help to ensure the right resources are allocated to the right tasks and in the right locations. AI can help crisis managers by combining data from scattered sources and offering a consolidated, real-time view of facts on the ground. One example is Google’s Wildfire Boundaries tracker that uses satellite imagery and AI models to detect the location of wildfire boundaries in real time and then display them in Search and Maps to support both responders and residents in making informed decisions.\n\nAnother example is in helping governments and NGOs to prepare and provide support and shelter to people displaced by extreme weather events. (See the sidebar Helping UNHCR Get Ahead of Forced Displacement in Somalia.)\n\n# Building Early-Warning Systems\n\nAI can save lives and minimize property damage by predicting devastating weather events and giving governments and people time to prepare. Riverine floods offer an example. Extreme rains take time to flow down river and that time can be put to good use taking action to mitigate their impact on communities along the banks. Flood Hub, an initiative of Google Research, enables governments, aid organizations, and individuals to take timely action and prepare for riverine floods via locally relevant\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
