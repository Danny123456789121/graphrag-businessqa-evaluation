Our investment strategies for foreign benefit plans vary according to the conditions in the country in which the respective benefit plans are situated. We have adopted a long-term investment horizon for all major foreign benefit plans. Although our policy is to invest in a risk-diversified portfolio consisting of a mix of assets, both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets can fluctuate over time, which exposes the Group to actuarial and market (investment) risks. Depending on the statutory requirements in each country, it might be necessary to reduce any underfunding by addition of liquid assets.\n\n# Plan Asset Allocation\n\n|€ millions|2023|2023|2022|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n| |Quoted in an Active Market|Not Quoted in an Active Market|Quoted in an Active Market|Not Quoted in an Active Market|\n|Total plan assets|714|1,120|611|1,012|\n|Thereof: Asset category| | | | |\n|Equity investments|190|0|170|0|\n|Corporate bonds|233|0|190|0|\n|Insurance policies|59|1,120|41|1,012|\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOur expected contribution in 2024 to our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans is immaterial. The weighted duration of our defined benefit plans amounted to 10 years as at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nTotal future benefit payments from our defined benefit plans as at December 31, 2023, are expected to be €2,707 million (2022: €2,404 million). Of this amount, 76% (2022: 76%) have maturities of over five years, and 55% (2022: 61%) relate to domestic plans.\n\n# (B.5) Other Employee-Related Obligations\n\n# Accounting Policy\n\nAs far as the obligation for long-term employee benefits is secured by pledged reinsurance coverage, it is offset with the relating plan asset.\n\n# Other Employee-Related Liabilities\n\n| |2023|2023|2022|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|€ millions|Current|Non-Current|Current|Non-Current|\n|Other employee-related liabilities|4,205|546|3,632|426|\n|Other non-financial liabilities|5,648|698|4,818|705|\n|Other employee-related liabilities as % of Other non-financial liabilities|74|78|75|60|\n\nOther employee-related liabilities mainly relate to obligations from bonuses and sales commissions, outstanding vacation, time credits accumulated in the working time account, employee-related social security expenses, severance payments outside restructuring programs, and jubilee expenses.\n\n# (B.6) Restructuring\n\n# Recognition of Restructuring Provisions\n\nWe only recognize provisions for restructuring if and when the following occurs:\n\n- SAP has designed a program that materially changes the scope of one of our businesses or the manner in which the business is conducted, and\n- A detailed and documented restructuring plan has been approved by our Executive Board, a member thereof, or a direct report of an Executive Board member, and\n- The program established is planned to start shortly after the program plan is approved and is expected to be completed in a timeframe that makes significant changes to the plan unlikely, and\n- The program has been announced to the parties affected or has commenced.\n\nWe consider whether a change in business is material based on the business affected rather than for SAP as a whole. In judging whether a unit qualifies as a business for restructuring purposes, we consider if the unit has its own management team, has access to all inputs and processes necessary to provide outputs, and generates or could generate revenues. The materiality of a change to a business is assessed based on both the size and the nature of the change and therefore does not necessarily involve a material quantitative impact on our financial statements.\n\n# Restructuring Expenses\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXECUTIVE BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Executive Board of SAP is responsible for the strategic direction and management of the company.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMESTIC PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Domestic plans refer to the defined benefit pension plans that SAP manages within its home country.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOREIGN PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Foreign plans refer to the defined benefit pension plans that SAP manages outside its home country.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Defined benefit plans are retirement plans where an employer promises a specified pension payment upon retirement, based on the employee's earnings history and tenure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTRUCTURING<|>EVENT<|>Restructuring refers to the process SAP undertakes to change the scope of its business operations or the manner in which it conducts business.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Sensitivity analysis is a financial modeling technique used to predict the outcome of a decision given a certain range of variables.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXECUTIVE BOARD<|>SAP<|>The Executive Board is responsible for the strategic decisions and management of SAP, guiding its operations and policies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOMESTIC PLANS<|>DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS<|>Domestic plans are a type of defined benefit plan that SAP manages for its employees in its home country<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOREIGN PLANS<|>DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS<|>Foreign plans are a type of defined benefit plan that SAP manages for its employees outside its home country<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESTRUCTURING<|>SAP<|>SAP recognizes restructuring provisions when it plans significant changes to its business operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS<|>DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS<|>Sensitivity analysis is used to assess how changes in assumptions affect the present value of defined benefit obligations<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
