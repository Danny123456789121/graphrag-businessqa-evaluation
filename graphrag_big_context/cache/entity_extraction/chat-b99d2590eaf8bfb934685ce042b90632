The portfolio includes the following offerings: SAP Sustainability Control Tower for holistic steering and reporting across ESG metrics and SAP Sustainability Data Exchange for sharing standardized sustainability data across supply chains.\n\n# Partners and Ecosystem\n\nOur worldwide ecosystem of more than 25,000 partners delivers not only services and support for our customers but also partner innovations that extend our solutions and ideally are built on SAP BTP.\n\n# Services and Support\n\nWe have reimagined our cloud services and support portfolio to focus on customer adoption and consumption. The Services and Support portfolio includes SAP Enterprise Support, which provides foundational tools and services, curated content, and mission-critical support. It can be enhanced with incremental success plans such as SAP Preferred Success and SAP Cloud Application Services as well as success services and consulting services to address specific objectives, timelines, and plans. When customers pursue enterprise-wide transformational change, SAP offers SAP MaxAttention and SAP ActiveAttention plans for tailored, long-term strategic engagement.\n\n# Our Customers\n\n# Vision and Strategy\n\n# Focusing on Customer Success\n\nWe aim to maximize the value our customers derive from their investment in, and relationship with, SAP at every touchpoint in their experience with us over the engagement lifecycle. Our customer-facing teams – across solutions, sales, services, customer engagement, ecosystem, and others – work together along an operating model that aims to harmonize internal processes with the goal of delivering improved outcomes for our customers.\n\n# Company-Wide Global Experience Program\n\nTo further address and improve customer feedback, we have a Company-Wide Global Experience (XM) Program in place. This program aims to achieve a consistent end-to-end experience for our customers by standardizing experience initiatives and methodologies to help identify and close experience gaps across SAP.\n\n# Due Diligence\n\n# Governance\n\nThe head of Customer Success leads all customer-facing functions across sales, services, partner, and cloud engagements for SAP’s businesses globally. The Chief Marketing and Solutions Officer leads the development of our solution value propositions to provide clarity on SAP’s core differentiators. The People & Operations Board area is responsible for the Company-Wide XM Program, including conducting the Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey. Customer NPS is a KPI in the short-term incentive component of Executive Board remuneration. For more information about the Customer NPS, see the Performance Management System section.\n\n# Guidelines and Policies\n\nPolicies such as the Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for Employees and applicable General Terms and Conditions for our product govern our relationships with our customers.\n\n53/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\nWe use the Customer NPS as a feedback mechanism to measure customer loyalty. This and other results from the customer survey allow us to directly understand the customer experience and identify key pain points for action. Because of the importance of our customers to SAP, Customer NPS is one of our main non-financial KPIs.\n\nIn 2023, our Customer NPS increased 2 points year over year to 9 (2022: 714), which is within our target range of 8 to 12. The increase was driven by feedback regarding our comprehensive and robust SAP solutions, established value to customers’ business, and relationships with account teams. The Company-Wide XM Program ensures that the feedback received is heard by the responsible organizations within SAP so they can act to continually improve the customer experience.\n\nFor 2024, we expect a Customer NPS of 9 to 13. Further, we aim to see continuous improvements and to increase the score steadily in the medium term.\n\n# Related Risks for SAP\n\nFor related financial risks, see Sales and Services in the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\n# Our Investments in Innovation\n\nSAP’s strong commitment to research and development (R&D) is reflected in our expenditures:\n\n|Research & Development (IFRS)1,2|€ millions|change since previous year|\n|---|---|---|\n|2019|4,292|18%|\n|2020|4,454|18%|\n|2021|5,270|15%|\n|2022|6,080|4%|\n|2023|6,324|4%|\n\n1 The numbers for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect continuing operations as a result of the divestiture of Qualtrics.\n\n2 In 2023, SAP updated its cost allocation policy. R&D numbers for 2020 and 2019 have not been retrospectively adjusted. For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (IN.1).\n\nIn 2023, our IFRS R&D ratio, reflecting R&D expenses as a portion of total revenue, decreased 0.3 percentage points (pp) to 20.3% (2022: 20.6%). Our non-IFRS R&D ratio decreased 1.1 pp to 18.0% year over year (2022: 19.1%). At the end of 2023, our total full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount in development was 36,444 (2022: 35,280). Measured in FTEs, our R&D headcount increased 1 pp to 34% of total headcount (2022: 33%).\n\nTotal R&D expense not only includes our own personnel costs but also the external costs of work and services from the providers and cooperation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
