Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects. For example, we: consolidated and harmonized our data centers and our data protection measures, which included implementing security information and event management solutions as well as enforcing network access control; invest significantly in infrastructure and processes to ensure consistently secure operations of our cloud solutions while continuously improving resistance, resilience, reusability, and scalability towards a standardized and harmonized portfolio; continuously enhance our infrastructure landscape capabilities and deployment options, including harmonized, efficient, and highly repetitive migration services; adhere to stringent SLAs with hyperscalers to ensure a high-quality customer experience; increase transparency through our continuously enhanced and expanded SAP Trust Center, in an effort to provide an appropriate level of information, for example, regarding planned patching activities and associated downtimes; monitor and invest in the continuous enhancement of our disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities; continuously aim for a homogeneous landscape that supports the complex infrastructure, application, and security requirements so that we can deliver the required service level for cloud services in a cost-effective manner; set up physical access control systems at facilities, multilevel access controls, closed-circuit television surveillance, security personnel in all critical areas, and recurring social engineering tests for SAP premises and data centers; control the access to information and information systems using authorization concepts that include managers and employees being regularly sensitized to the issues and given mandatory security and compliance trainings; adapt our cloud service delivery to local or specific market requirements (such as local or regional data centers) and comply with all local legal regulations regarding data protection and privacy as well as data security; establish contracts and SLAs with our public cloud partners to ensure that data security and privacy measures meet local regulatory and compliance standards and SAP’s own standards for data security and privacy; maintain strict internal policies and controls concerning utilization of our partner’s cloud infrastructure, including people, process, and technology standards required to enhance compliance and cyber resilience; closely monitor data center utilization, capacity, and pipeline for subsequent investment planning; regularly conduct risks reviews, disclosure requests, and audits to ensure public cloud providers meet SAP’s data privacy and security standards; ensure PCI-validated compliance through successful PCI DSS audits; invest in training and certifications concerning hyperscaler and related next-generation technologies; and implement best-of-breed tools for IT operations management and automation.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be unlikely, and classify this risk factor as medium.\n\n# Cybersecurity and Security\n\nCybersecurity attacks or breaches, and security vulnerabilities in our infrastructure or services or those of our third-party partners could materially impact our business operations, products, and service delivery.\n\nSAP delivers a full portfolio of solutions, hosts or manages elements of our customers’ businesses in the cloud, processes large amounts of data, and provides mobile solutions to users. While SAP executes each of these areas either directly or through partners and other third parties, our industry continues to experience a complex and threatening cybersecurity landscape. The severity of these cybersecurity threats is amplified due to the increasingly sophisticated and malicious global landscape in which we operate. This includes third-party data, products, and services that we incorporate into SAP products and services, and the increasingly advanced obfuscation, control-circumvention, and related techniques and tools – such as artificial intelligence – employed by threat actors targeting IT products, businesses, and the supply chain.\n\nWhen we become aware of unauthorized access to our systems or those of our third-party partners, we have action plans in place intended to identify and remediate the source and impact of such events. Like many companies, we and certain of our third-party partners have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks and other security incidents that affect our business. While we experience cybersecurity incidents of various kinds in the ordinary course of our business, we are not aware of any such incidents that have had a material impact on our business.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in many areas including, but not limited to, an increasing number of global threat actor attacks using ransomware as their preferred method of attack as well as exploiting known and unknown bugs, errors and vulnerabilities in our software and systems or those of business partners, customers or other third parties. Given the nature of complex systems, software and services like ours, and the scanning tools that we deploy across our networks and products, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities are prioritized based on known and anticipated risks, and remediation activities aim to patch within the designated timeframes.\n\nAlthough we have standard routine patch management processes, we are unable to comprehensively apply patches or to confirm that mitigating measures are in place to mitigate all such vulnerabilities, or that any patches will be applied before exploitation by a threat actor. In other situations, vulnerabilities persist even after we have issued security patches, because our customers may fail to either apply the patches, update their systems, or authorize service downtime sufficient to allow for patching by SAP. If attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities before patches are installed or mitigating measures are implemented, significant compromises could impact our and our customers’ systems and data.\n\nWe could also experience material exposure to our business operations and service delivery due to disruptions to backups, disaster recovery or business-continuity management processes, or as the result of malicious or inadvertent actions by threat actors, employees, contractors, or a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
