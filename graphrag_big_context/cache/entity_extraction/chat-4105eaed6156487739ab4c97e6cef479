The technologies we used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking systems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, electronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The fitted values of parameters p and q are consistent with other academic research. It takes about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 years in the latest scenario.\n\n# 2. Work hours that could be automated\n\nThe impact of automation on work hours across different capability levels is estimated below for the technical automation potential and automation adoption:\n\n- Impact by occupation by scenario: Number of FTEs X % automation estimate by scenario\n- Impact by activity: Number of FTEs X time spent on activity per year X percent automation estimate by scenario\n- Impact by occupation group: Σ occupation (Number of FTEs X percent automation estimate by scenario)\n\n# 3. Impact of automation on productivity\n\nWe used GDP per FTE as the measure of productivity. We calculated automation output under different scenarios by multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We considered only job activities that are available and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, we assumed that automation has a labor.\n\n6 FTEs whose job titles include these detailed work activities.\n\n7 For occupations included within the occupation group.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nsubstitution effect but no other performance gains. Finally, we assumed that labor replaced by automation will rejoin the workforce at the same level of productivity as today. We also assumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, even if the total number of FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes.\n\nUnder the assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption by country as follows:\n\nAdditional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity\n\nThe additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the productivity impact of automation.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n61\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThe research underpinning this report was led by Michael Chui, an MGI partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office; Eric Hazan, a senior partner in the Paris office; Roger Roberts, a partner in the Bay Area office; Alex Singla, a senior partner in the Chicago office; Kate Smaje and Alex Sukharevsky, senior partners in the London office; Lareina Yee, a senior partner in the Bay Area office; and Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner in the New York office.\n\nThe project team included Dmitry Gafarov, Shivani Gupta, Dan Hababou, Leila Harouchi, Sonja Lindberg, Kerin Lo, Alexandre Pons, Alok Singh, Gurneet Singh Dandona, and Wilbur Wang.\n\nThis research benefited immensely from the expertise and perspectives of many McKinsey colleagues.
