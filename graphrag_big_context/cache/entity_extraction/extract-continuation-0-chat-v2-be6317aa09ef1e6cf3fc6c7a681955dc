Our latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases we analyzed—by comparison, the United Kingdom’s entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. This would increase the impact of all artificial intelligence by 15 to 40 percent. This estimate would roughly double if we include the impact of embedding generative AI into software that is currently used for other tasks beyond those use cases.\n\n# 2.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the value that generative AI use cases could deliver falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D. Across 16 business functions, we examined 63 use cases in which the technology can address specific business challenges in ways that produce one or more measurable outcomes. Examples include generative AI’s ability to support interactions with customers, generate creative content for marketing and sales, and draft computer code based on natural-language prompts, among many other tasks.\n\n# 3.\n\nGenerative AI will have a significant impact across all industry sectors. Banking, high tech, and life sciences are among the industries that could see the biggest impact as a percentage of their revenues from generative AI. Across the banking industry, for example, the technology could deliver value to $340 billion annually if the use cases were fully implemented. In retail and consumer packaged goods, the potential impact is also significant at $400 billion to $660 billion a year.\n\n# 4.\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities. Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today. In contrast, we previously estimated that technology has the potential to automate half of the time employees spend working. The acceleration in the potential for technical automation is largely due to generative AI’s increased ability to understand natural language, which is required for work activities that account for 25 percent of total work time.\n\n# 5.\n\nThe pace of workforce transformation is likely to accelerate, given increases in the potential for technical automation. Our updated adoption scenarios, including technology development, economic feasibility, and diffusion timelines, lead to estimates that half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or roughly a decade earlier than in our previous estimates.\n\n# 6.\n\nGenerative AI can substantially increase labor productivity across the economy, but that will require investments to support workers as they shift work activities or change jobs. Generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and redeployment of worker time into other activities. Combining generative AI with all other technologies, work automation could add 0.5 to 3.4 percentage points annually to productivity growth. However, workers will need support in learning new skills, and some will change occupations. If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.\n\n# 7.\n\nThe era of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL CHUI<|>PERSON<|>Michael Chui is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERIC HAZAN<|>PERSON<|>Eric Hazan is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROGER ROBERTS<|>PERSON<|>Roger Roberts is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALEX SINGLA<|>PERSON<|>Alex Singla is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE SMAJE<|>PERSON<|>Kate Smaje is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALEX SUKHAREVSKY<|>PERSON<|>Alex Sukharevsky is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAREINA YEE<|>PERSON<|>Lareina Yee is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RODNEY ZEMMEL<|>PERSON<|>Rodney Zemmel is one of the authors contributing to the research on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can generate content and automate tasks, significantly impacting productivity and economic growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL ECONOMY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The global economy is the interconnected economic activities of countries worldwide, which could be significantly impacted by generative AI.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL CHUI<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Michael Chui is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERIC HAZAN<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Eric Hazan is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROGER ROBERTS<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Roger Roberts is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEX SINGLA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Alex Singla is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE SMAJE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Kate Smaje is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEX SUKHAREVSKY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Alex Sukharevsky is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAREINA YEE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Lareina Yee is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RODNEY ZEMMEL<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Rodney Zemmel is an author who has researched the economic potential of generative AI, contributing to its understanding and implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>GLOBAL ECONOMY<|>Generative AI has the potential to add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy, significantly impacting productivity and economic growth<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
