Most respondents now report that their organizations—and they as individuals—are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development—two functions in which previous research determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3—as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\n\n3 “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\n\n# Exhibit 3\n\nRespondents most often report generative AI adoption in their marketing and sales, product and service development, and IT functions.\n\n# Respondents’ organizations regularly using generative AI (gen AI), by function, % of respondents\n\n|34|23|17|16|16|13|12|8|7|6|4|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Marketing and sales|IT|Service operations|Human resources|Strategy and corporate finance|Manufacturing|Product and/or service development|Other corporate functions|Software engineering|Risk|Supply chain/inventory management|\n\n# Most commonly reported gen AI use cases within function, % of respondents\n\n|Marketing and sales|Product and/or service development|IT|\n|---|---|---|\n|16|10|7|\n|Content support for marketing strategy|Design development|IT help desk chatbot|\n|15|6|7|\n|Personalized marketing|Scientific literature and research review|Data management|\n|8|6|6|\n|Sales lead identification and prioritization|Accelerated early simulation/testing|IT help desk AI assistant1|\n\n1 Eg, providing real-time assistance and script suggestions to help desk employees during human-to-human conversations.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 1,363 participants at all levels of the organization, Feb 22–Mar 5, 2024\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents’ personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia–Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen AI tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\n\n# Exhibit 4\n\nRespondents are much more likely now than in 2023 to say they are using generative AI.\n\nPersonal experience with generative AI tools, by job title, and age, 2023–24, % of respondents\n\n|Regularly use for work|Regularly use and outside of work|Regularly use outside of work|Have tried at least once|No exposure|Don’t know| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |2023|2|2|3|3|3|\n|4|4|5|9|4| | |\n|8|8|10|7|11| | |\n|18|18|15|12|17| | |\n| |19|18| |32| | |\n|35|33|31|39|31| | |\n| |40|42|42|35|30| |\n| |37| |17| |16| |\n|16| |15|23|20| | |\n| |24| |13|26|16| |\n| |20| |21|18|16|28|\n| |22|34|31| | | |\n|Overall average|C-level executives|Senior managers|Midlevel managers|Born in 1964 or earlier|Born 1965–80|Born 1981–96|\n\nNote: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.\n\n1 In 2023, n = 1,684; in 2024, n = 1,363.\n\n2 In 2023, C-suite respondents, n = 541; senior managers, n = 437; and middle managers, n = 339.
