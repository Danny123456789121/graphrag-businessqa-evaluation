Our overarching approach is one of corporate transparency, open communication with financial markets, regulators, and authorities, and adherence to recognized standards of business integrity. This commitment to recognized standards of business integrity is formalized in SAP’s CoEBC and supporting guidelines.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: non-compliance with our policies and violation of compliance related rules, regulations, and legal requirements including, but not limited to, antitrust, anticorruption, and antibribery legislation in Germany, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt conduct; unethical and fraudulent behavior leading to criminal charges, fines, and claims by affected parties; collusion with external third parties; fraud and corruption; public sector transactions in\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nterritories exposed to a high risk of corruption; or increased exposure and impact on business activities in highly regulated industries. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows. In recent years, the investigation team within SAP’s Office of Ethics & Compliance (OEC), together with the assistance of an external law firm, investigated whistleblower complaints alleging that the business conduct of some former SAP employees within subsidiary SAP companies did not comply with SAP’s policies and procedures or applicable laws. These investigations culminated in January 2024 in a settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), as well as with local authorities in South Africa. SAP fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities, and took immediate steps to discipline the employees involved, including terminating all those implicated in potential law violations. Since these allegations were made, SAP has also significantly strengthened its compliance program and related internal controls in accordance with DOJ and regulatory expectations and requirements.\n\nSAP has encountered situations in the past that required clear messaging and strong action on non-compliance in the context of corrupt behavior that has the potential to harm our business and reputation. SAP is continuing to investigate its dealings with the public sector.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects. For example, we: continuously evolve our comprehensive compliance program based on the three pillars of prevention, detection, and response; improve associated business processes, to prevent further and future violations; review partner business models, to mitigate risks of corruption while meeting agility requirements; conduct internal audits of our compliance programs related to bribery, corruption, and substantial fraud; annually reconfirm commitment to the CoEBC by SAP’s workforce (except where disallowed by local legal regulations); implement compliance policies and processes aimed at managing third parties and preventing misuse of third-party payments for illegal purposes, including the performance of compliance due diligence activities prior to the engagement of third parties; and launched a Partner Integrity Initiative aimed at examining the compliance programs of partners in SAP’s ecosystem and reviewing the SAP-related deals closed by them. We also introduced a platform called \"Speak Out at SAP\" for anyone within and outside of SAP to raise confidentially and, if desired, anonymously their concerns on ethics and compliance related to our CoEBC and any law or regulation.\n\nDespite our comprehensive and continuously evolving compliance programs and internal controls, intentional efforts of individuals to circumvent controls or engage in corruption, especially by way of collusion with other involved parties, cannot always be prevented. We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and classify this risk factor as medium.\n\n# Operational Business Risks\n\nSales and Services: Sales and implementation of SAP software and services, including cloud, are subject to several significant risks sometimes beyond our direct control. A core element of our business is the successful implementation of software and service solutions. The implementation of SAP software and cloud-based service deliveries is led by SAP, by partners, by customers, or by a combination thereof.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: implementation risks caused by insufficient or incorrect information provided by customers, insufficient customer expectation management, including scope, integration capabilities and aspects, and a lack of purposeful selection, implementation, or utilization of SAP solutions; a lack of customer commitments and respective engagements; challenges to achieve a seamlessly integrated, sufficiently automated and aligned service delivery; unrenderable services committed during the sales stage; inadequate contracting and consumption models based on subscription models for services, support, and application management; deviations from standard terms and conditions; or statements concerning\n\n134/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nsolution developments that might be misperceived by customers as commitments on future software functionalities. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects. For example, we: integrate risk management processes into SAP’s project management methods that are intended to safeguard implementations through coordinated risk and quality management programs; conduct ethical scope reviews and monitoring that are adapted as required as part of a clearly defined change request process together with respective project governance, steering, monitoring and controlling activities; and put in place a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
