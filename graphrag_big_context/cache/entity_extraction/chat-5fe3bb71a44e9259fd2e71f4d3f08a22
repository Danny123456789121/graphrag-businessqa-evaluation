We found a statistically significant difference between domestic and international banks with regard to their SS performance (df = 278, t = 3.274, p = 0.001). Domestic banks performed better with regard to the sustainability score than international banks (𝑥domestic = 0.435, 𝑥international = 0.338). The t-test for government-owned banks and other banks did not result in a statistically significant difference between these two groups (df = 278, t = −1.097, p = 0.274).\n\nSecondly, we tested the difference between the three categories: social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The results of the Hotelling Test [82] indicate a significant difference between the three categories (T2 = 1871, F = 619.2, p < 0.0001). Environmental sustainability achieves the highest average, with social sustainability as the second-highest category, followed by green products and services (𝑥environment = 0.61, 𝑥social = 0.41, 𝑥green products = 0.24).\n\nAs the next step, we analyzed the change in the sustainability performance SS as well as of the three sustainability sub-groups over time, as we assumed that the introduction of the ERM created a change with regard to the banks’ sustainability performance. The change over time is presented in Figure 1, suggesting a slight increase in all three sustainability fields over time.\n\n# Figure 1.

The results of the ANOVA show that the change of the sustainability score over time is significant (F = 24.86, df = 4,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
