By comparison, the bulk of potential value in high tech comes from generative AI’s ability to increase the speed and efficiency of software development (Exhibit 5).\n\n# Exhibit 5\n\nGenerative AI could deliver significant value when deployed in some use cases across a selection of top industries.\n\n|Selected examples of key use cases for main functional value drivers (nonexhaustive)|Value potential|Value potential|\n|---|---|\n| |High|Low|\n|Total value potential|per industry, $ billion (% of industry revenue)|Value potential, as % of operating profits1|\n|Banking|200–340 (3–5%)|9–15|\n|Retail and consumer packaged goods2|400–660 (1–2%)|27–44|\n|Pharma and medical products|60–110 (3–5%)|15–25|\n|Product R&D, software engineering|Customer operations|Marketing and sales|\n|Legacy code conversion|Customer emergency interactive voice response (IVR)|Custom retail banking offers|\n|Optimize migration of legacy frameworks with natural-language translation capabilities|Partially automate, accelerate, and enhance resolution rate of customer emergencies through generative AI–enhanced IVR interactions (eg, for credit card losses)|Push personalized marketing and sales content tailored for each client of the bank based on profile and history (eg, personalized nudges), and generate alternatives for A/B testing|\n|Accelerate consumer research by testing scenarios, and enhance customer targeting by creating “synthetic customers” to practice with|Augmented reality–assisted customer support|Assist copy writing for marketing content creation|\n|Rapidly inform the workforce in real time about the status of products and consumer preferences|Accelerate writing of copy for marketing content and advertising scripts|Procurement suppliers process enhancement|\n|Research and drug discovery|Customer documentation generation|Generate content for commercial representatives|\n|Accelerate the selection of proteins and molecules best suited as candidates for new drug formulation|Draft medication instructions and risk notices for drug resale|Prepare scripts for interactions with physicians|\n\n1 Operating profit based on average profitability of selected industries in the 2020–22 period.\n\n2 Includes auto retail.\n\nIn the banking industry, generative AI has the potential to improve on efficiencies already delivered by artificial intelligence by taking on lower-value tasks in risk management, such as required reporting, monitoring regulatory developments, and collecting data. In the life sciences industry, generative AI is poised to make significant contributions to drug discovery and development.\n\nWe share our detailed analysis of these industries in the following industry spotlights.\n\n26 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Spotlight: Retail and CPG\n\n# Generative AI could change the game for retail and consumer packaged goods companies\n\nThe technology could generate value for the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry by increasing productivity by 1.2 to 2.0 percent of annual revenues, or an additional $400 billion to $660 billion.1 To streamline processes, generative AI could automate key functions such as customer service, marketing and sales, and inventory and supply chain management.\n\nTechnology has played an essential role in the retail and CPG industries for decades. Traditional AI and advanced-analytics solutions have helped companies manage vast pools of data across large numbers of SKUs, expansive supply chain and warehousing networks, and complex product categories such as consumables.\n\nIn addition, the industries are heavily customer facing, which offers opportunities for generative AI to complement previously existing artificial intelligence. For example, generative AI’s ability to personalize offerings could optimize marketing and sales activities already handled by existing AI solutions.\n\nSimilarly, generative AI tools excel at data management and could support existing AI-driven pricing tools. Applying generative AI to such activities could be a step toward integrating applications across a full enterprise.\n\n# Accelerating the creation of value in key areas\n\nGenerative AI tools can facilitate copy writing for marketing and sales, help brainstorm creative marketing ideas, expedite consumer research, and accelerate content analysis and creation.
