According to the results of the research, Sustainable HRM is organized into four (interconnected) main dimensions: Justice and equality, transparent HR practices, profitability, and employee well-being. The analysis also reveals how these dimensions are linked to different stakeholder groups. Thus, Sustainable HRM seems to bring the people and respect for humanity back to the human resource management and widen the future HR perspective to include both internal and external stakeholders. It also embraces more employee-oriented thinking in organizations, turning the leadership in a more responsible direction [34].\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\n# Results of the literature review\n\nResults of the literature review indicate that Sustainable Human Resource Management plays a significant and positive role in achieving organizational outcomes. Moreover, via the strength of the HRM system, it exerts an additional impact upon employees and external stakeholders [35].\n\nSustainable HRM practices enhance profit maximization for the organization and at the same time reduce the negative harmful influence on employees, their families, and communities [36]. The beneficial role of Sustainable HRM varies therefore with regards to the organization, the employees, and the society.\n\nThe positive influence Sustainable HRM has on the organization can be observed in the growth of the overall value of the organization’s worth [37–40], as well as in the increase of national and international competitiveness [41]. Those improved results can be attributed to the impact Sustainable HRM has on the employees. It can be observed that Sustainable HRM leads to improved employee engagement [42], increased employee satisfaction, and therefore higher organizational loyalty [43], HR quality boost [44], motivation growth [40, 44], employee development, and enhanced work efficiency [40].\n\nSustainable HRM is beneficial for the organization and for the employees, but it also positively affects other stakeholder groups. The general effect Sustainable HRM has on the society as a whole can be characterized as a contribution to the activities of the societies. Sustainable HRM incorporates activities directed towards improving communities and neighbourhoods. Additionally, it allows creating sustainable career pathways for the younger generations to become transitional on the job market and secure a better future [45].\n\nSustainable HRM is at times considered a new humanistic paradigm in management, which, although sometimes recognized as an alternative to the economic one, does not separate itself from the necessity of generating profit by an enterprise [5,21,32].\n\nThe direct effect of implementing the concept of Sustainable HRM is shaping sustainable human resources, i.e., highly qualified employees who understand and apply the principles of sustainable development in their work. This concept includes both: Managers setting directions at all levels of the company, as well as employees employed in non-managerial positions [20,46].\n\n# Functions of Sustainable Human Resource Management\n\nSustainable Human Resource Management is assigned numerous functions in an organization. E. Cohen, S. Taylor, and M. Muller-Camen [47] claim that it:\n\n- Supports the organization’s sustainable development strategy;\n- Emphasizes fair treatment, development, and the well-being of employees;\n- Contributes to building the skills, value, and trust of employees and increases their engagement in sustainable development;\n- Focuses on the well-being of the internal (employees) and external (all entities interested in the functioning of the organization) stakeholders;\n- Supports environmentally-friendly organizational practices.\n\n# 1.3. Sustainable Management Research Model\n\nOne of the first attempts to capture the complexity of the concept of Sustainable Human Resource Management is the holistic model by Peggy De Prins. According to De Prins [19], Sustainable HRM focuses on the optimal use and respect of human capital in the organization in which the clear relationship between the organization’s strategic policies and the environment in which it operates is built. The model assumes four aspects of Sustainable HRM [48] (pp. 15–17): Sociological, psychological, ecological, and strategic. On the basis of the De Prins model and the Sustainable HRM aspects included in it, a research model was built that indicates the double role of HR departments, consisting in carrying out activities in the area of the three mentioned aspects and introducing them into the company’s strategy. This model is the basis in the study.\n\nThe Sustainable HRM framework, including all of those aspects, is depicted in the figure below and developed next.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\nThe psychological perspective focuses on the employee and, in particular, on what one deems important. If assumed that people play a key role in creating a lasting competitive advantage, then the knowledge about and promoting of what motivates them to work should be of significant importance for the organization [18]. An important role in this aspect of Sustainable HRM is played by: Work–life balance, autonomy, self-development, and a balanced career. An example of the latter will be used to study the psychological aspect of Sustainable HRM. A balanced career is different from the traditional career path, as 20th century enterprises mostly applied the economic paradigm in management.\n\nThe new career model, based on the idea of careers as actions, as means of learning, and as boundary-less entities, has replaced the prior model of careers as structures, as means of earning, and as constrained entities. This new concept of career has gained the name of a balanced career. Its source lies in the more commonly used concept of human sustainability.\n\nAn exemplary definition was provided by Carl Holling, who defined human sustainability as: “the capacity to create, test and maintain adaptive\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
