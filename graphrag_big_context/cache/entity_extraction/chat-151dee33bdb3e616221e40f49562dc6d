For those arrangements cloud revenue is recognized based on consumption as it best reflects the measure towards satisfaction of the performance obligation(s).\n\nThe evaluation of cloud revenue contracts bears an inherent risk of errors due to the complex nature of certain contracts. SAP defined detailed accounting policy guidelines in line with the applicable accounting standards and has established uniform processes throughout the group to manage the accounting for its cloud contracts. Applying them often requires significant management judgement, in particular with respect to whether certain agreements with the same customer are economically linked and need to be combined, whether the various services that are owed by the Group according to the contract qualify as separate performance obligations, the allocation of the transaction price of a customer contract to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone-selling prices and the point in time at which the provision of services by the Group for the specific performance obligation commences.\n\nCloud revenue recognition is a key audit matter due to the significance of the cloud revenue and the high degree of complex judgement required. The respective cloud revenue disclosures of the Group are contained in section “A.1 Revenue” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Auditor’s Response and Observations\n\nWe evaluated the design and we tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the revenue process, including controls related to the identification of certain economically linked agreements and separate performance obligations, the allocation of the transaction price to the\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nperformance obligations in certain contracts, and the point in time at which the provisioning of service commenced. We tested a sample of underlying contractual agreements and other related documents to evaluate the Group’s assessment of whether certain agreements were economically linked, the identified performance obligations, the allocation of the transaction price and the point in time at which the provision of service for the performance obligations identified commenced. We tested key contractual terms and conditions from the respective contracts to evaluate the identified performance obligations and the point in time at which the provision of service for the identified performance obligations commenced.\n\nBased on the audit procedures we performed, we have found management’s judgements used for revenue recognition of cloud contracts, particularly in the area of assessing whether certain contracts are economically linked and need to be combined, identifying separate performance obligations, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligation, and assessing the point in time at which the provision of services commenced, acceptable.\n\n# ASSESSMENT OF THE GROUP’S UNCERTAIN TAX TREATMENTS\n\n# Matter\n\nThe Group disclosed contingent liabilities relating to tax uncertainties of EUR 1,815 million. The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions which continually revise, change, and implement tax laws with complexities and uncertainties due to different interpretations of these tax laws, especially relating to transfer pricing and intercompany transactions for the use of intellectual property. The identification, recognition, measurement and disclosure of certain income tax risks specifically from transfer pricing and intercompany transactions for the use of intellectual property requires significant management judgement in determining key assumptions to be applied to the interpretation of tax laws, related regulations, case laws and mutual agreement procedures across multiple jurisdictions. Significant management judgement is also required to determine whether a transfer pricing tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained and to assess whether intercompany transactions are based on the arm’s length principle. These management judgements demand a high degree of expertise, for which the Group regularly engages external experts to provide tax opinions to support their own risk assessment.\n\nThe respective disclosures regarding uncertain tax positions of the Group are contained in section “C.5 Income Taxes” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Auditor’s Response and Observations\n\nWe involved internal experts with specialized skills and knowledge in taxation to evaluate the appropriateness of management’s methods and key assumptions used to estimate certain uncertain tax positions. We verified our understanding of the relevant facts by evaluating certain of the Group’s transfer pricing documentation and we assessed whether the Group’s processes and guidelines in connection with certain intercompany transactions support an arm’s length position. For certain group business activities, we evaluated the reasonableness and consistency of management’s judgments (including application of tax regulations and interpretations), key assumptions and processes. We assessed the overall reasonableness of conclusions reached regarding the identification, recognition, measurement and disclosure of certain uncertain tax positions from transfer pricing and intercompany transactions for the use of intellectual property.\n\nBased on the audit procedures we performed, we have found management’s judgements related to the estimation of uncertain tax positions, specifically from transfer pricing and intercompany transactions for the use of intellectual property, acceptable.\n\n# MEASUREMENT OF UNLISTED EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n# Matter\n\nThe Group holds unlisted equity securities held at fair value of EUR 4,811 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily relating to Sapphire Ventures investments. These investments in unlisted equity securities are classified as financial instruments at fair\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nvalue through profit and loss requiring a recurring fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs. The measurement of the fair value of certain investments is complex and, with regard to the assumptions made, highly dependent on management's estimates and judgments. This applies particularly to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the fair value of such investments relating to significant unobservable inputs used, such as the selection of appropriate comparable company data, in deriving revenue multiples as well as forecasted performance of the investees.\n\nThe respective disclosures regarding the fair value measurement of unlisted equity securities of the Group are contained in sections “D.6 Equity Investments” and “F.2 Fair Value Disclosures on Financial Instruments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Auditor’s Response and Observations\n\nWe involved internal experts with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation to assist in assessing and evaluating\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
