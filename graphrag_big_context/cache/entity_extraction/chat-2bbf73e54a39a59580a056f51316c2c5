They break servers down into components that can be reused by others, and return other items to suppliers for recycling and reclamation. The first of these centers opened in 2020 in Amsterdam and has been able to channel 83% of e-waste into reuse—and 17% into recycling. Based on that initial success, five other Circular Centers were established in 2022.\n\n# Other Potential Risks\n\nThe rise of AI also brings a set of societal and ethical risks that must be managed vigilantly. It is important to have a set of clear principles that guide the development and use of AI. For example, Google has outlined the following seven key principles for its development of AI applications:\n\n1. Be socially beneficial\n2. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias\n3. Be built and tested for safety\n4. Be accountable to people\n5. Incorporate privacy design principles\n6. Uphold high standards of scientific excellence\n7. Be made available for uses that accord with these principles\n\n# Application Selection and Optimization Metrics\n\nThere are any number of climate-unfriendly applications to which AI could be applied, for example, oil and gas exploration. Google, for instance, has pledged not to develop customized AI/machine learning solutions to facilitate upstream extraction for oil and gas. In addition, algorithms could be designed to optimize for financial or other outcomes over environmental ones. For example, travel website algorithms could steer customers to the cheapest flights regardless of carbon emissions instead of guiding them toward an informed compromise between price and emissions.\n\nIn 2016, Google announced a “Zero Waste to Landfill” goal for its data center operations, which it defines as more than 90% of waste diverted from landfill. In 2022, 38% of Google owned and operated data centers had achieved Zero Waste to Landfill.\n\nOther firms—for example, Iron Mountain through its 2021 acquisition of ITRenew, which specialized in refurbishing and repurposing used data center equipment from hyper-scale operators—are pursuing circularity as a business opportunity.\n\nIt is also important to guard against unintended consequences. While AI can help optimize resource use and curtail emissions, there are scenarios in which it could influence consumer behaviors that lead to unintended increases in emissions. For instance, AI-powered autonomous vehicles and smart transportation systems can optimize routes and reduce fuel consumption, but their convenience could lead to increased vehicle use, which could potentially increase overall emissions if the vehicles are not predominantly electric or powered by renewable energy sources.\n\nLooking beyond the risk of negative environmental impact, we must guard against unethical applications, for example, the spreading of misinformation and disinformation.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Equity and Bias\n\nClearly, AI models need to be trained on diverse data sets that reflect the world’s range of people to ensure both fairness and the accuracy of model output. And beyond that, it is essential that we take positive steps to ensure that the growth of AI does not exacerbate regional disparities. Today, the majority of advanced climate modeling and AI development occurs in the Global North. This divide arises from several factors, including the Global North’s more extensive technological infrastructure that allows for richer data collection—for instance, through satellites and drones—and its greater computing power. Additionally, AI expertise and resources tend to be more readily available in these affluent regions when compared with the Global South.\n\n# Privacy and Security\n\nThe large data sets that train AI algorithms will at times include personal data. It is essential to ensure that AI applications are aligned with established privacy standards and regulations to protect individuals.\n\nGiven the promise of AI to address the climate crisis, policymakers will want to encourage its use—but also mitigate its potential risks. The next chapter offers a summary of critical policy outcomes.\n\nHowever, the concentration of AI development and application in certain regions has significant repercussions. Climate AI models primarily trained on data from the Global North may inadvertently neglect vital information about the Global South, with its distinct climate patterns, vulnerabilities, and emissions sources. A Google Research team in Ghana, for example, is focused on leading many sustainability initiatives of particular interest to Africa in collaboration with local universities and research centers. Additionally, historical data often mirrors emissions and climate impacts in more industrialized regions, further skewing data representation. When such biased AI models inform climate assessments or policymaking for the Global South, they risk yielding flawed and inaccurate outcomes. Excluding specific regions or historical periods can result in inaccurate predictions and evaluations of carbon emissions, environmental consequences, and climate trends in these underserved areas. This undermines climate science accuracy and obstructs effective decision-making and planning for climate adaptation and mitigation in the Global South.\n\n27 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# AI for Climate\n\n# A Summary of Critical Policy Outcomes\n\nPolicymakers play a central role both in harnessing the potential of AI for climate action and in ensuring its sustainable and equitable use.\n\nIn this chapter, we share a set of suggestions for policymakers that synthesizes the convergences and complementarities across more than 30 expert interviews and a comprehensive review of the literature (See the References section for more detail). We also draw on best-practice approaches from related policy domains such as energy, transport, and buildings.\n\n# Policy can make a difference in ensuring and accelerating the following three critical outcomes:\n\n- Enabling the use of AI for climate action by building awareness and ensuring equal access to data, technology infrastructure, and talent around the globe\n- Deploying public-sector solutions on priority use cases while catalyzing private sector action through the right incentives\n- Promoting the responsible use of AI in climate action, taking into account its potential environmental as well as social impacts\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\nExhibit 6 offers a menu of possible policy moves in support of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
