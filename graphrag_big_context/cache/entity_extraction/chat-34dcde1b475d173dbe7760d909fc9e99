This result signals that controlling shareholders may not see the whole set of social and sustainability issues as a priority. It is important to highlight the new finding that more large stockholders appear to be able to contest the excess power of controlling blockholders and reduce the negative impact of high ownership concentration over CSP, signaling an emerging contest power in this context. Besides, larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities seem to be more committed to undertaking social and sustainability actions.\n\nThe contribution of the work is twofold and may be of interest to distinct constituencies. The research analyzes the composition of the ISE index (Brazilian ISE) which indeed integrates ESG concerns. For researchers, the index analysis is important given its relevance nowadays when social concerns in general have gained importance in financial markets. Starting from the ISE index analysis, the work provides additional evidence on the firm’s attributes that influence CSP, as proxied by membership to the ISE index. Similar research may be undertaken in other markets using similar methodology, given that indices such as ISE do not publicize firm punctuation.\n\nNew relevant evidence is provided about the fact that firms from environmental risky industries are linked to higher probability of composing the sustainability index and thus to higher standards of social and sustainability activities. This finding builds on stakeholder theory by highlighting positive results from the Brazilian environmental legislation, being an important discovery to both environmentalists and academics. The analysis of how voting ownership concentration affects firm’s CSP builds on both agency and stakeholder theories by exposing agency conflicts and stakeholders’ interests. This examination provides evidence that CSP is negatively affected by high ownership concentration in Brazil, in accordance with prior results but also pointing out the new finding that the presence of other large shareholders, who are associated to more ownership dispersion, seem to be able to contest the power of large controlling blockholders.\n\nThe paper concludes highlighting the importance of enforcing corporate social and sustainability institutionalization in Brazil. The positive effects obtained from the advances in environmental legislation must be taken into account to foster strengthening in other dimensions of CSP such as the relations with employees and civil society. Policymakers ought to observe society demands and the need to preserve the natural environment. In this regard, the encouragement of civil society to pressure government and firms for better CSP is very relevant.\n\nThe present findings are relevant to the ongoing debate on the importance of CSP and firms’ attributes that influence on it. Thus, this work meets the request from international audience for this kind of research in emerging economies which present distinct institutional environments and incipient capital markets. The results refer to the 9a economy in the world that is a BRIC member.\n\nSome research lines are identified. Analyzing the seven ISE axes separately may be considered a limitation of this work while it is a challenge for future research. Studying the effect of other aspects of Brazilian firms’ ownership structure also emerges as another insightful research as is the case of controlling blockholders’ nature. Specific works may also try to capture the capacity of civil society organizations to pressure for CSP advances.\n\n# Note\n\n1.
