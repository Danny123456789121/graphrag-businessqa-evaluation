Worth noting is that 59.81 per cent of firms from environmental risky industries.\n\ncent of firm-year observations (1,606) are from environmental risky industries which means that Brazilian legislation has expanded more effective environmental control to a broad spectrum of industries. Among the firms that are members of the ISE sustainability index, the highest proportion is relative to environmental risky industries (73.15 per cent), while only 26.85 per cent are from other industries. That is a strong indication in the direction of H2 which predicts that firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have greater CSP.\n\nResults for model estimates of equation (1) for the whole sample are exhibited in Table V. Alternate models that include debt as explanatory variable were estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms (Table VI).\n\nAs hypothesized, voting ownership concentration of the Brazilian firm negatively affects its CSP, proxied by the probability of the firm being in the ISE index (Table V) (H1). This result is consistent to models estimated with different measures of ownership concentration, i.e. the presence of a major controlling shareholder (MAJOR) (Table V, column i), the sum of voting stocks in hands of the first up to the three main shareholders (OWNC1 to OWNC3) (Table V, columns iii, iv and v) and also by the Herfindahl index among the five main stockholders (HI5) (column ii). Taking into account that CSP includes ESG concerns such result is consistent with the argument that large controlling shareholders of the Brazilian firm may not see sustainability concerns as so relevant. Together, corporate governance and the economic pillar of sustainability are very important in the ISE index (approximately 30 per cent of the questionnaire). The high importance of corporate governance concerns embedded in the ISE sustainability index may be relevant for this inverse relation given that prior literature has pointed out ownership concentration is associated to weaker corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Hu and Izumida, 2008; BrandaËœ o and Crisostomo, 2015). Under the agency theoretical framework, this situation may contribute to a rise in agency conflicts among controlling, minority and external stakeholders. It is also noticed that the negative effect of ownership concentration over CSP is absent when considering.\n\n# Table V\n\n# Panel data logistic models of CSP on firm attributes for the whole sample\n\n|Variable|(i)|(ii)|(iii)|(iv)|(v)|(vi)|(vii)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|MAJOR|0.955|â€“|â€“|â€“|â€“|â€“|â€“|\n|HI5|â€“|1.975|â€“|â€“|â€“|â€“|â€“|\n|OWNC1|â€“|â€“|1.719|â€“|â€“|â€“|â€“|\n|OWNC2|â€“|â€“|â€“|2.013|â€“|â€“|â€“|\n|OWNC3|â€“|â€“\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
