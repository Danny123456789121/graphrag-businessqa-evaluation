We thereafter expected cloud revenue to range between €14.0 billion and €14.4 billion, cloud and software revenue to range between €26.9 billion and €27.4 billion, and operating profit (non-IFRS) to range between €8.6 billion and €8.9 billion. Furthermore, we adjusted the anticipated share of more predictable revenue to 82% and thereafter expected a free cash flow of approximately €4.9 billion.\n\nIn July 2023, to reflect then-current market development, we updated and tightened our ranges slightly. We lowered our expectations for cloud revenue to a range between €14.0 billion and €14.2 billion, and for cloud and software revenue to a range between €27.0 billion and €27.4 billion, but increased the range slightly for our expected operating profit (non-IFRS) to between €8.65 billion and €8.95 billion.\n\nIn October 2023, SAP reaffirmed its July 2023 outlook.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# 2023 Actual Revenue and Profit Performance Compared to Outlook (Non-IFRS)\n\nCloud revenue is within the range of our revised 2023 outlook, with the combined cloud and software and operating profit exceeding the upper end of our outlook range.\n\n# Comparison of Outlook and Results for 2023\n\n|Results1|Outlook for 2023|Revised Outlook for 2023|Results for 2022|Q1 Quarterly Statement|Half-Year Report|Q3 Quarterly Statement|Results for 2023|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cloud revenue|€15.3 billion|€14.0 billion to €15.7 billion|€10.67 billion|€14.0 billion|€14.0 billion|€14.2 billion|€14.06 billion|\n|Cloud and software revenue|€28.2 billion|€26.9 billion to €28.7 billion|€24.01 billion|€27.0 billion|€27.0 billion|€27.4 billion|€27.64 billion|\n|Operating profit|€8.8 billion|€8.6 billion to €9.1 billion|€7.67 billion|€8.65 billion|€8.65 billion|€8.95 billion|€9.04 billion|\n|Share of predictable revenue|79%|83%| |82%|82%|82%|81%|\n|Free cash flow|€4.39 billion|approx. €5.0 billion| |approx. €4.9 billion|approx. €4.9 billion|approx. €4.9 billion|€5.08 billion|\n|Effective tax rate (IFRS)|28.0%|28.0%|32.0%|to 32.0%|to 32.0%|to 32.0%| |\n|Effective tax rate (non-IFRS)|26.0%|26.0%|29.6%|to 28.0%|to 28.0%|to 28.0%|29.3%|\n\n1 Results for 2022 have been adjusted for continuing operations to reflect the divestiture of Qualtrics.\n\nIn the current global economic climate shaped by continuously high asset prices and disrupted by international conflicts, coupled with an increasing demand for artificial intelligence and data warehousing, the demand for our cloud solutions and services confirms our revised expectations, reflecting the strong business performance which is expected to continue to accelerate cloud revenue growth.\n\nOur current cloud backlog (contractually committed cloud revenue that we expect to recognize over the upcoming 12 months) reached €13.75 billion at actual currencies (€14.04 billion at constant currencies; 2022: €11.73 billion at constant currencies). This was an increase of 25% (27% on a constant currency basis; 2022: 24%). The growth rate of our current cloud backlog is in line with our guidance from the year before to achieve a growth rate similar to 2022, while at a larger scale.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, total cloud backlog was up 37% to €44.25 billion (up 39% to €45.09 billion at constant currencies).\n\nAt constant currencies, the resulting cloud revenue grew from €10.67 billion in 2022 to €14.06 billion in 2023, in line with our guidance range of €14.0 billion to €14.2 billion. That represented an increase of 23% at constant currencies.\n\nCloud and software revenue grew 9% at constant currencies to €27.64 billion (2022: €24.01 billion), and thus ended higher than our revised outlook range forecasted for 2023 of €27.0 billion to €27.4 billion.\n\nThanks to the strong increase in cloud business, we were able to increase the share of more predictable revenue 2pp to 81% (2022: 79%), which is 1pp below our revised outlook.\n\nTotal revenue on a constant currency basis grew 9% in 2023 to €32.03 billion (2022: €27.90 billion).\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOperating expenses (non-IFRS) on\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a global software company known for its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and cloud solutions, aiming to enhance business performance and revenue growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUALTRICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Qualtrics is a software company specializing in experience management, which SAP planned to divest from in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EURO<|>GEO<|>The Euro is the currency used in the financial figures mentioned, representing the economic context of SAP's operations in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APRIL 2023<|>EVENT<|>In April 2023, SAP adjusted its outlook for continuing operations, reflecting changes in expected revenue and profit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULY 2023<|>EVENT<|>In July 2023, SAP updated its revenue expectations based on market developments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCTOBER 2023<|>EVENT<|>In October 2023, SAP reaffirmed its July 2023 outlook regarding revenue and profit expectations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>QUALTRICS<|>SAP planned to divest Qualtrics, indicating a significant change in its business strategy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APRIL 2023<|>SAP<|>In April 2023, SAP adjusted its financial outlook, which is a key event in its operational timeline<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULY 2023<|>SAP<|>In July 2023, SAP updated its revenue expectations, reflecting ongoing adjustments in its business strategy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCTOBER 2023<|>SAP<|>In October 2023, SAP reaffirmed its outlook, indicating stability in its financial projections<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EURO<|>SAP<|>SAP's financial results are reported in Euros, linking the organization to the economic context of the Eurozone<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
