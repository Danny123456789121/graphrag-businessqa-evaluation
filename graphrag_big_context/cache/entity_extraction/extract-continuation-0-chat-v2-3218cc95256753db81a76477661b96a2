Our dividend policy is to pay a dividend totaling 40% or more of profit after tax. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of SAP SE will recommend to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2024 a total dividend for 2023 of €2.20 per share (2022: €2.05). Based on this recommendation, the overall dividend payout ratio (which means the total distributed dividend as a percentage of profit after tax based on continued and discontinued operations) would be 43% (2022: 140%). Compared to the total dividend in 2023, the proposed dividend increased by 7%. The payment in 2022 included a special dividend of €0.50 to celebrate SAP’s 50th anniversary.\n\nIf the shareholders approve this recommendation, and based on the number of treasury shares as at December 31, 2023, the total amount distributed in dividends will be €2,568 million. The actual amount distributed could be different from this total amount, because the number of shares held as treasury.\n\n79/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nstock might change before the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

The primary aim of our financial management is to maintain liquidity in the Group at a level that is adequate to meet our financial obligations at all times. Most SAP entities have their liquidity managed centrally by the Group, so that liquid assets across the Group can be consolidated, monitored, and invested in accordance with Group policy. High levels of liquid assets help keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent. In addition, various credit facilities are currently available for additional liquidity, if required. For more information about these facilities, see the Credit Facilities section.\n\nWe manage credit, liquidity, interest rate, equity price, and foreign exchange rate risks on a Group-wide basis. We use selected derivatives exclusively for this purpose and not for speculation, which is defined as entering into a derivative instrument for which we do not have corresponding underlying transactions. The rules for the use of derivatives and other rules and processes concerning the management of financial risks are documented in our Treasury Guideline, which applies globally to all companies in the Group. For more information about the management of each financial risk and about our risk exposure, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes (F.1) and (F.2).\n\n# Capital Structure Management\n\nThe primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and customer confidence, and to support the growth of our business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will enable us to cover our funding requirements through the capital markets at reasonable conditions, and in so doing, ensure a high level of independence, and financial flexibility. For more information about the capital structure and its analysis, see the Analysis of Consolidated Statement of Financial Position section and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.1).\n\nThe long-term credit rating for SAP SE is “A2” by Moody’s (positive outlook) and “A+” by Standard & Poor’s (stable outlook).\n\nOn May 16, 2023, SAP announced a new share repurchase program with an aggregate volume of up to €5 billion and a term until December 31, 2025.
