Rudolph and Popp (2007) found that individuals with strong directional goals tend to interpret issues univalently—that is, as either clearly positive or clearly negative. Because of the strong direction decision makers with a paradoxical frame will no-\n\n# Academy of Management Review\n\n# October\n\n# FIGURE 3\n\n# Effects of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame on Issue Interpretation\n\n| |Paradoxical frame| |Business case frame| | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |P4b|PSb|P6|PSa|P4a| |\n|Low|Moderate|High| | | | |\n\nDecision makers notice a wide range of aspects of a sustainability issue. This broad and inclusive approach will increase their sense of control over sustainability issues, since they believe they will not have missed any important dimension of the problem (Das & Teng, 1999). On the other hand, because of the more complex structure of their frame, decision makers will accept that there are tensions and conflicts between different economic, environmental, and social aspects that can never be fully resolved (Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, in press; Smith & Lewis, 2011). This heightened awareness of conflict will lower their sense of control over the issue (Das & Teng, 1999). Overall, then, we expect decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a moderate sense of control over sustainability issues.\n\nThe greater diversity of the paradoxical frame also affects the valence of the evaluation of sustainability issues. “Ambivalent evaluations are likely to arise when executives examine more diverse aspects of an issue, which itself is in part driven by the [cognitive] frameworks employed in the process” (Plambeck & Weber, 2010: 692). Research in environmental psychology (Castro, Garrido, Reis, & Menezes, 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004) shows that the multidimensionality of sustainability issues spurs ambivalent issue interpretations. For instance, domestic waste recycling has been found to simultaneously induce both positive evaluations and negative evaluations—for example, doubts about the overall effect of personal efforts when others do not recycle as well (Castro et al., 2009). With a very low sense of control, decision makers will perceive issues to be beyond their own influence, which will lead them to disengage from the issue and fall back on simpler univalent assessments. With a very high sense of control, decision makers will also evaluate issues univalently because they are overly confident that they can master an issue with existing resources.\n\nroutines and fail to consider alternatives (Miller, 1993). Overall, we expect managers with a paradoxical frame, and the resulting moderate sense of control, to experience enough control to handle diverse and competing aspects of an issue, but not enough control to rely excessively on routine evaluations. As a result, such managers will more likely apply distinct and competing positive and negative evaluations simultaneously (see Figure 3).\n\n# Proposition 4b:\n\nThe more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to perceive a moderate sense of control over a wide range of sustainability issues and to interpret these issues ambivalently.\n\nSince managerial sensemaking of strategic issues is embedded in an organizational context, organizational identity has been suggested as a critical factor affecting interpretation (Bundy, Shropshire, & Buchholtz, 2013). Organizational identity represents the shared beliefs about the central, distinctive, and enduring features of an organization (Albert & Whetten, 1985). It guides and filters individuals’ interpretation of strategic issues, shaping the meanings given to an issue (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Walsh, 1995). Organizational identity defines what aspects decision makers see as positive or negative and what are seen as legitimate interpretations (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). We therefore expect that the effects of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame on issue valence will be moderated by organizational identity.\n\nA homogeneous identity leads to a single uncontested conceptualization of what is central, distinctive, and enduring about the organization. With its strong self-reinforcing dynamic (Fiol, 2002), a homogeneous identity keeps organizational members focused on organizational goals (Pratt & Foreman, 2000). In the case of a unitary “business” identity (Albert & Whetten, 1985), the “competitive business model in which success is measured in terms of above-market returns and ever-increasing growth rates is more deeply ingrained in . . . beliefs and practices” (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009: 448). Decision makers are primed by such existing routines and are therefore less likely to integrate a diverse set of aspects in their interpretation of strategic issues (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that include nonbusiness aspects tend to be delegitimized. In contrast, a heterogeneous identity (Gioia, Schultz, & Corley, 2000; Pratt & Foreman, 2000) admits more diverse aspects and, thus, makes ambivalent evaluations more likely (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Organizations with heterogeneous conceptualizations of their central, distinctive, and enduring features accommodate multiple interpretations (Gioia et al., 2000) and tend to have more complex relationships with a wide spectrum of external stakeholders (Brickson\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
