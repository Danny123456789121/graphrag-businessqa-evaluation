On this basis, it was determined whether and what activities related to diversity management, building a sustainable professional career for employees, and shaping pro-ecological attitudes are practised in enterprises represented by MBA course students, and what activities related to sustainable human resource management are introduced by the HR department to the company’s strategy. The relationship between taking actions related to the social, psychological, and environmental aspects in the area of HRM and the strategic aspect was calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient. The obtained absolute values of the correlation coefficient were interpreted as follows [67]: r < 0.3, weak correlation; r < 0.5, moderate correlation; up to r < 0.7, high correlation; to r < 0.9, very high correlation; r < 1, the correlation is almost complete. In order to find out which variables (dimensions) significantly explain the shaping of the variables that make up the strategic aspect, regression models (multiple regression) were constructed. The calculations were made using the Statistica TIBCO 13.3 statistical package.\n\n# 3. Results\n\n# 3.1. Actions Taken for the Sustainable Management of Human Resources\n\n# 3.1.1. The Social Aspect\n\nDetailed data on the respondents’ opinions on diversity management in their enterprises are presented in Table 2 and Figure 2.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\n# Table 2. The social aspect—descriptive statistics.\n\n|Variable|N|Median|Mode|Mode Population|Skewness|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Social 1|73|5|5|21|−0.27|\n|Social 2|73|5|6|23|−0.35|\n|Social 3|73|5|6|19|−0.27|\n|Social 4|73|4|3|21|0.27|\n|Social 5|73|3|3|22|0.49|\n|Social 6|73|5|6|27|−0.57|\n\n# Social aspect\n\n|Number of observation|22|29%|24|32%|20|26%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|20|18|22%|22%|18|23%|19%|\n|14|14|12|16%|10|14%|12%|\n|11%|8|10%|8|6|8%|6|\n|4|4%|4|5%|2|1%|0|\n\n# Figure 2. The social aspect—undertaking activities for the benefit of various groups of employees.\n\nActivities that make up the diversity management in an organization are practiced in at least some enterprises. When assessing individual statements on a seven-point scale, the respondents rarely chose the extreme answers (1 and 7) and the middle answer (4). In the case of statements 1, 2, 3, and 6, more than half of the respondents indicated that actions for specific groups of employees are undertaken in their enterprises (median 5). They concern activities for older workers, various age groups, people with disabilities, and women. In three groups, the mode was 6 (answer “yes”). On the other hand, when assessing activities for various cultural (statement 4) and religious (statement 5) groups, less than half (slightly more than 1/3) of respondents indicated that they were undertaken in their enterprises. The median was 4 and 3, respectively, and the mode was 3.\n\n# 3.1.2. The Psychological Aspect\n\nDetailed results concerning the possibility of pursuing a sustainable professional career by employees (psychological aspect) are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3. According to the respondents, their enterprises undertake activities enabling them to pursue a sustainable professional career. This applies in particular to creating opportunities for professional development (statement 4), incurring related costs by the company (statement 5), and treating employees.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\nas a key resource of the organization (statement 1). In each of these statements, the distributions are strongly asymmetric (left-sided asymmetry—the percentage of affirmative answers is over 85%) and the median and mode were 6. The number of people choosing the affirmative answer definitely prevailed (78%) in the assessment of statement 2, concerning providing employees with work in line with their interests and talents, as well. However, the mode and median in the assessment of this statement were equal to 5, which means that at least half of the respondents answered “rather yes”. It was also the most frequently given answer. In the assessment of statements 3 (providing employees with coaching) and 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in behaviours for sustainable development), yes also prevailed (59% each), however, the asymmetry in the distribution of responses is smaller, and the most frequently chosen answer was “rather yes”—mode 5. When assessing practices used in the field of sustainable career development, the respondents rarely chose the extremely negative answer (only statements 5 and 6—4 and 3%, respectively) or the middle answer (from 0 to 13%).\n\n# Table 3.
