Companies need to find ways to maximize the value created by the generative AI they deploy while also taking care to monitor and manage its impact on their workforces and society at large.\n\n# The generative AI future of work: Impacts on work activities, economic growth, and productivity\n\nTechnology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines have given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines enabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. More recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that would have taken years to do manually.\n\nThese examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of individual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual level, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, although as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could affect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as a result of this technology than for older technologies.\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation of work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated that workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by\n\nadapting technology that existed at that time, or what we call technical automation potential.\n\nWe also modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies could be adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy.\n\nTechnology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological capabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a solution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even when such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, which consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a sense of the pace and scale at which workers’ activities could shift over time.\n\nLarge-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented. Consider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years ago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and where to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a more macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of all workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people leave their jobs every month in the United States. But this does not minimize the challenges faced by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or societal challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in demand and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living.\n\nAlso, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic perspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the world’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are aging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.\n\nThe analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work activities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and integrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for technical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment the capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers whose activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the future (see Box 3, “About the research”).\n\nLabor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Box 3\n\n# About the research\n\nThis analysis builds on the methodology we established in 2017. We began by examining the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net breakdown of about 850 occupations into roughly 2,100 detailed work activities. For each of these activities, we scored the level of capability necessary to successfully perform the activity against a set of 18 capabilities that have the potential for automation (exhibit).\n\nBased on these assessments of the technical automation potential of each detailed work activity, we modeled potential scenarios for the adoption of work automation around the world. First, we estimated a range of time to implement a solution that could automate each specific detailed work activity, once all the capability requirements were met by the state of technology development. Second, we estimated a range of potential costs for this technology when it is first introduced, and then declining over time, based on historical precedents.\n\nWe modeled the beginning of adoption for a specific detailed work activity in a particular occupation in a country (for 47 countries, accounting for more than 80 percent of the global workforce) when the cost of the automation technology reaches parity with the cost of human labor in that occupation.\n\nThe modeled scenarios create a time range for the potential pace of automating current work activities. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.\n\n# Exhibit\n\nOur analysis assesses the potential for technical automation across some 2,100 activities and 18 capabilities.\n\n|~850 occupations|~2,100 activities assessed|Capability requirements|\n|---|---|---|\n|Examples|across all occupations| |\n|Retail salespeople|Example: Retail activities| |\n| |• Answer questions about products\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that analyzes the impact of technological automation on work activities and models scenarios of adoption.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can create content and automate tasks, impacting work activities and productivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country that has experienced significant shifts in agricultural employment from 1962 to 2013, reflecting broader economic changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where millions of people leave their jobs every month, indicating a dynamic labor market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT<|>EVENT<|>The event of agricultural employment in China decreasing from 82% in 1962 to 13% in 2013 illustrates significant economic and labor market changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LABOR PRODUCTIVITY<|>EVENT<|>Labor productivity refers to the efficiency of labor in producing goods and services, which is crucial for economic growth and prosperity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The McKinsey Global Institute analyzes the impact of generative AI on work activities and productivity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT<|>The decrease in agricultural employment in China is a significant event reflecting economic changes in the country<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>LABOR PRODUCTIVITY<|>The dynamic labor market in the United States affects labor productivity and economic growth<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>LABOR PRODUCTIVITY<|>Generative AI has the potential to enhance labor productivity by automating tasks and augmenting workforce capabilities<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
