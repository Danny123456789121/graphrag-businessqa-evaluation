In a 3° to 4°C world, that number increases to 74%. If we stay on our current trajectory, the World Bank estimates an additional 143 million people—more than the combined populations of the United Kingdom, Morocco, and Malaysia—could be displaced. And, absent significant investments in resilience, major global cities—for example, Tokyo, Osaka, Mumbai, Bangkok, New York, London, and Lagos—will find themselves partly under water.\n\nWe urgently need new tools to accelerate the reduction and removal of GHG emissions—and to help citizens, cities, regions, countries, and businesses make plans to adapt to the inevitable impacts of warming. AI offers much promise.\n\n# Climate Action Has an Analytical Challenge— and AI Can Help\n\nLeaders increasingly understand the urgency. So far, 194 parties to the Paris Agreement have developed Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—each representing detailed commitments for how their country will help the world meet the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal—up from 75 parties in February 2021.\n\nBut avoiding the most catastrophic impacts of warming requires more than political will. To achieve real progress, we need to develop a much richer analytical understanding of a complex system comprising many variables and feedback loops. (See Exhibit 1.)\n\n# Exhibit 1 - Climate is an interlinked, multi-parameter system\n\n| | |Core climate characteristics| |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Human activities, such as fossil fuel burning and land use changes, create significant volumes of greenhouse gas.| | | |\n|Increase in impermeable surfaces|Urbanization| | |\n| |Water|Emissions have varying impacts on core climate characteristics, and changes in these processes can worsen the greenhouse gas effect.| |\n|Changes in precipitation|Temperature| | |\n|Salinity|Ice cap melting| | |\n|Ocean circulation upheaval|Clouds| | |\n|Carbon cycle disturbance|Average temperature rise| | |\n|Global warming|Gulf Stream modification| | |\n|Abrupt climate change|Europe cooling| | |\n|Land use changes|Sea level rise| | |\n|CO2|NO2| | |\n|CH4|Fluctuations in climate characteristics drive major impacts—natural, physical, and socioeconomic—at both local and global scales.| | |\n| | |Cyclones|Food|\n|Heat waves| |Droughts| |\n|Disease spread|Disasters| | |\n|Biodiversity losses|Casualties| | |\n|Economic losses|Famines| | |\n| | |Major impacts| |\n\nSource: Philippe Rekacewicz, Emmanuelle Bournay, UNEP/GRID-Arendal; BCG analysis.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\nDeveloping models is essential to understanding the relationships among variables—and to anticipating the likely impact of different strategies and choices. But modeling these complex interconnections on a local and global scale is a huge challenge. It requires assembling massive, longitudinal, and real-time global data sets. Information is needed on climate (for example, temperatures, ocean processes, and meteorological phenomena) and on human activities (for example, emissions, and land use changes). And not all the necessary data is even available.\n\nBut understanding the complex systems that drive climate-relevant outcomes is exactly the kind of challenge at which AI excels. By amalgamating and processing massive data sets, AI can reveal elusive patterns and valuable insights, facilitate scenario development and prediction, accelerate the evaluation of multiple courses of action, enable operational optimizations, and help monitor progress toward predefined goals.\n\n# Estimating AI’s Potential Contribution\n\nBased on our research and experience, the three broad areas in which AI can accelerate climate progress are the following:\n\n- Mitigation. Helping with both the reduction and removal of emissions—and with the underlying measurement needed to size the challenge and track progress\n- Adaptation and Resilience. Aiding citizens, countries, regions, cities, and businesses to prepare for and respond to the inevitable impacts of a warming planet\n- Foundational Capabilities. Enabling climate action via improvements in climate modeling, climate economics, and climate education, as well as accelerating breakthrough innovations that will open new horizons for climate action\n\nBusiness leaders agree. In a 2022 BCG survey of senior executives with leadership roles related to climate or AI (see AI is Essential for Solving the Climate Crisis), 87% viewed AI as a helpful unlock for climate issues. They saw supporting emissions reduction as the top climate use case for AI in their organizations, but expressed interest in other applications as well. (See Exhibit 2.)\n\n# Exhibit 2 - Leaders believe AI can play a role in climate action, especially in helping to reduce emissions\n\n|In which areas of climate-related advanced analytics and AI do you see the greatest business value for your organization?
