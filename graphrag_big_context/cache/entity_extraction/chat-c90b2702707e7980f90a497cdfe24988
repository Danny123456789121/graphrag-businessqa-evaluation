The number of employees engaged as pro-bono consultants increased 45% year over year to 518.\n\n# Equitable Access to Education and Employment – Build Future Skills\n\nSAP invests in innovative education models and fosters engagement with multistakeholder partnerships to enable pathways to employment and entrepreneurship in the sustainable and digital economy for youth in need (underrepresented, underserved, and underprivileged youth between the ages of 16 and 24).\n\nIn 2023, SAP continued collaborating with UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited and the digital marketplace Yoma to advance SAP Educate to Employ, a pilot program educating youth in need on soft skills, foundational knowledge, and SAP skills to enable a pathway to a successful career in the SAP ecosystem. The program started in Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines, and South Africa with the goal of transitioning 25 youth per country to SAP-related roles. It has since engaged over 224,000 youth in digital skills training.\n\nIn 2023, in total, digital skill-building and coding programs trained 41,806 teachers and engaged 2.8 million youth, of which 46% were girls.\n\n# Equitable Access to a Green Economy – Collaborate for Sustainability\n\nSAP fosters employee engagement, aligning employee contributions with its holistic sustainability framework. In 2023, SAP employees dedicated over 137,000 volunteer hours, of which 74% were skills-based. Our internal SAP Together volunteering and donation platform counts 47,300 registered employees and 459 volunteering opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, through a long-standing partnership with We Are Family Foundation, SAP champions youth inclusion in global dialogues through the Youth to the Table and Youth to the Front Fund programs. This collaboration increases youth representation in critical forums such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), UN General Assembly (UNGA), and Conference of the Parties (COP), showcasing SAP’s dedication to intertwining social responsibility with tangible sustainability efforts and inclusivity. In 2023, SAP’s sponsorship enabled over 35 youth social entrepreneurs and climate leaders to engage in a diverse array of forums, resulting in hundreds of meaningful exchanges.\n\nThis strategy also covers SAP’s humanitarian aid efforts extending to natural disasters and beyond. Where applicable, we mobilize a swift and effective response, providing immediate aid while focusing on long-term, sustainable rebuilding efforts.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Social Investments section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor.\n\n74 Exchange rate date: December 31, 2023.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Sustainable Procurement\n\nMaking Our Supply Chain More Sustainable\n\nA significant part of our social and environmental impact is delivered through our supply chain. Eliminating single-use plastics, decreasing carbon emissions, respecting human rights, and closely collaborating with a diverse supplier network are factors that contribute to a sustainable supply chain. Our Global Procurement Organization (GPO), led by our chief procurement officer (CPO), aims to transform into a purpose-driven program. That is why we established the overarching Procurement with Purpose (PwP) initiative, which promotes purpose-driven initiatives such as diversity and social inclusion and environmental improvement from vendors.\n\n# Upholding High Standards Across Our Supply Chain\n\nThe SAP Supplier Code of Conduct75 (SCoC) is required in our standard supplier contracts and is an essential part of our supplier registration. This supplier registration ensures that potential suppliers of SAP are aware of SAP’s SCoC. We review and update our SCoC regularly to maintain high standards within our supplier network – the latest update being a new and improved version that was published at the end of 2023. This strengthens the SCoC’s enforceability and sends a clear message to our suppliers about its importance for SAP.\n\nOur SCoC contains provisions on labor standards, human rights, environmental standards, and diversity and inclusion. Furthermore, we recommend to SAP suppliers that they deliver goods and services that are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.\n\n# What We Buy and Where We Buy It From\n\nIn 2023, we spent approximately €6.4 billion in purchases from around 13,000 suppliers worldwide (2022: approximately €7.2 billion from more than 13,000 suppliers worldwide). Within our seven procurement categories,76 we approach sustainable procurement from different angles:\n\n- IT Solutions (example: reduce single-use plastics packaging and packaging material)\n- Professional Services (example: CO2-reduced mobility concepts, electronic contracts)\n- Marketing (example: sustainable merchandise and events)\n- Cloud Infrastructure (example: sustainable cooling of data centers)\n- Technical Services (example: managed services with remote delivery)\n- Real Estate & Facilities (example: increase of self-produced solar energy and avoidance of single use tableware)\n- Car Fleet (example: sustainable mobility concepts with a commitment to emissions-free vehicle-only car fleet from the year 2025)\n\n75 Link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n76 (1) Car Fleet: Includes procurement relating to the global company car fleet and additional mobility options. (2) Cloud Infrastructure: Procures products and services for SAP’s cloud operations such as network services, data center, co-location, hyperscaler, middleware, and related goods and services. (3) Marketing: Supports topics related to SAP’s marketing, events, and merchandise. (4) Professional Services: Includes financial and legal services, temporary staff, and business travel areas. (5) Technical Services: Includes application and development services. (6) IT Solutions: Includes procurement for areas such as client services, equipment, communication, and software.
