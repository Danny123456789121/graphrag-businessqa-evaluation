This is particularly important since, while 87% of organizations acknowledge the role of AI in climate action, only 40% can envision practical applications within their own operations.\n\n# Leaders could:\n\n- Integrate AI solutions and expertise into government strategic planning on climate priorities (for example, Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and sector-specific transition plans).\n\nExample: AI4PublicPolicy—an initiative of the EU’s R&D program Horizon 2020—is creating an open cloud platform for automated, scalable, transparent, and citizen-centric policy management. Lisbon, for example, is using it to map its current inventory of, and expansion potential for, solar panels—with the goal of developing renewables supply forecasts to inform building codes and incentive budgets.\n\n- Define priority sectors or use cases for AI to support climate action at local and regional levels (for example, as part of Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, or National AI strategies).\n\n# Examples:\n\n- Denmark’s AI strategy (2019) identifies three climate-related priority areas: energy efficiency, precision agriculture, and traffic optimization.\n- The Netherlands’ Strategic Plan for AI (2019) includes commitments to leverage AI in agriculture and in accelerating the energy transition.\n- The UK’s AI Roadmap advocates for AI use to address climate change, particularly in the energy sector.\n- The government of the Republic of the Philippines is advocating using AI to tackle climate change adaptation challenges and disaster risk reduction—in particular, through programs led by the Department of Science and Technology, such as AI for a Better Normal.\n\n- Implement priority public sector AI solutions for climate.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- The US National AI Initiative Act of 2020 formalizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) role in coordinating AI applications for climate, ocean, Earth, and space sciences. NOAA has created the NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI), which collaborates across scientific fields to promote responsible and equitable AI use for environmental research.\n- Singapore is using AI to predict floods and test flood-resilient infrastructure. For example, a partnership between the island nation’s National Research Foundation and the Hydroinformatics Institute (H2i) has developed Virtual Water, a surface water simulation toolbox that can predict and simulate floods resulting from heavy rainfall events.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Encourage Private Sector Adoption\n\nPolicymakers could also play a catalytic role in accelerating private sector AI adoption by addressing major challenges hindering the at-scale implementation of AI for climate. Globally, we see the following five key hurdles:\n\nTo address these challenges, policymakers could activate the following five corresponding key levers:\n\n- Create public/private partnerships to drive AI adoption in key sectors and applications\n- Unclear Goals. In the absence of clear regional, national, or sector-specific objectives for climate action, AI-driven innovation may become fragmented, and resource allocation inefficient. The establishment of priority innovation domains for climate action can be a significant unlock.\n- Regulatory Limitations. In some cases, particularly in heavily regulated sectors such as energy and transport, policymakers could adopt a thoughtful, risk-based governance framework for AI that ensures sufficient protections and safeguards while taking care not to stifle innovation. And, conversely, the lack of clear regulatory frameworks in other areas might also impede investment.\n- Infrastructure Challenges. Many high-emission sectors rely on legacy infrastructure that cannot readily support AI technologies. For example, outdated road networks may struggle to accommodate smart traffic management systems powered by AI—or limited penetration of smart meters could hinder the at-scale deployment of AI-based energy efficiency solutions.\n- Innovation Costs. Developing and implementing AI solutions often demands significant financial resources and time. Giving access to specific innovation platforms, such as high-performing computing infrastructure—or to targeted innovation funding—can remove significant barriers to innovation for the innovation ecosystem broadly, and particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.\n- Deployment Costs. In many areas, there may be significant entry or adoption costs, including capacity and capability needs, that pose challenges for companies, their stakeholders, and customers. For example, the adoption and implementation at scale of precision agriculture could be held back because of farmer concerns regarding the expense of installing the Internet of Things hardware needed to support it.\n\n- Remove regulatory barriers to and provide regulatory support and clarity for AI adoption\n- Accelerate infrastructure modernization and digitalization to enable AI use\n- Support AI research and innovation in climate-relevant domains by involving both academia and the private sector\n- Optimize incentives to drive AI adoption at scale for climate action priorities when existing mechanisms are insufficient (for example, public funding, tax credits, etc.)\n\nNonetheless, these levers need to be tailored to the distinct challenges of each jurisdiction and sector. These challenges are shaped by both global and context-dependent factors such as market intricacies, complexity, regulatory frameworks, and innovation dynamics. Therefore, policymakers could adopt a strategic approach by identifying the most effective measures to address these challenges and determining the appropriate level of intervention, whether through advocacy, incentives, or binding measures. They could also draw insights from best practices within each sector and jurisdiction, as well as across sectors and jurisdictions, in order to learn from one another.\n\nFor example, consider the implementation of AI in grid planning and management. AI solution developers may encounter a constraint that necessitates holding specific licenses to test or develop their solutions. In such circumstances, policymakers might consider issuing regulatory waivers or establishing controlled testing environments. Similarly, in regions with limited smart meter adoption, policymakers could take action by allocating funding for infrastructure modernization or offering incentives to encourage electricity providers to replace aging meters. These measures would facilitate the integration of AI applications designed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\nTo underscore sectoral distinctions, in the following, we provide examples to illustrate how policymakers have begun implementing policies in sector-specific contexts.\n\n35 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
