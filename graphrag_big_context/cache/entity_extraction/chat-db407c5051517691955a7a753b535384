In 2023, we distributed €2,395 million (€2.05 per share) in dividends for 2022, compared to €2,865 million (€2.45 per share, including a special dividend of €0.50 to celebrate SAP’s 50th anniversary) paid in 2022 for 2021 and €2,182 million (€1.85 per share) paid in 2021 for 2020. The total dividend available for distribution to SAP SE shareholders is based on the profits of SAP SE as reported in its statutory financial statements prepared under the accounting rules in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Executive Board intends to propose that a dividend of €2.20 per share (that is, an estimated total dividend of €2,568 million), be paid from the profits of SAP SE.\n\n# Non-Controlling Interests\n\nUntil divestiture in June 2023, Qualtrics issued new shares to serve share-based payment awards under the Qualtrics Omnibus plan, which further reduced SAP’s ownership in Qualtrics to 69% (2022: 71%). In the first half of 2023, a loss of €141 million (2022: €366 million) was attributed to non-controlling interests of Qualtrics. For more information about the divestiture of Qualtrics, see Note (D.1). In 2023, a loss of €33 million (2022: €210 million) was attributed to non-controlling interests of other SAP entities.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# (E.3) Liquidity\n\n# Accounting for Non-Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nClassification and Measurement of Non-Derivative Financial Debt Investments\n\nOur non-derivative financial debt investments comprise cash at banks and cash equivalents (highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, such as time deposits and money-market funds), loans and other financial receivables, and acquired debt securities.\n\nWe generally classify financial assets as: at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the contractual cash flows of, and our business model for, holding the respective asset. Financial assets having cash flow characteristics other than solely principal and interest such as money market and similar funds are classified as FVTPL. Generally, other financial assets with cash flows consisting solely of principal and interest are held within a business model whose objective is “hold to collect” and are thus classified as AC. Occasionally, such other financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is “hold to collect and sell” in which case they are classified as FVOCI.\n\nGains/losses on non-derivative financial debt investments at FVTPL are reported in Financial income, net and show interest income/expenses separately from other gains/losses which include gains/losses from fair value fluctuations and disposals. Gains/losses on non-derivative financial debt investments at AC are reported in Financial income, net and show interest income/expenses separately from other gains/losses which include gains/losses on disposals and changes in expected and incurred credit losses. Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net. Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at the trade date.\n\n# Impairment of Non-Derivative Financial Debt Investments\n\nFor these financial assets, we apply considerable judgment by employing the general impairment approach as follows:\n\n- For cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities such as acquired bonds and acquired commercial papers, we apply the low credit risk exception, as it is our policy to invest only in high-quality assets of issuers with a minimum rating of at least investment grade to minimize the risk of credit losses. Thus, these assets are always allocated to stage 1 of the three-stage credit loss model, and we record a loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. This loss allowance is calculated based on our exposure at the respective reporting date, the loss given default for this exposure, and the credit default swap spread as a measure for the probability of default. Even though we invest only in assets of at least investment-grade, we also closely observe the development of credit default swap spreads as a measure of market participants’ assessments of the creditworthiness of a debtor to evaluate probable significant increases in credit risk to timely react to changes should these manifest. Among others, we consider cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations in full, when there is information about a counterparty’s financial difficulties or if there is a drastic increase in a counterparty’s credit default swap spread for a prolonged time period while the overall market environment remains generally stable. Such financial assets are written off either partially or in full if the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, which might be evidenced, for example, by the bankruptcy of a counterparty of such financial assets.\n- Loans and other financial receivables are monitored based on borrower-specific internal and external information to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. We consider such assets to be in default if they are significantly beyond their due date or if the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligation. A write-off occurs when the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, for example when bankruptcy proceedings have been finalized or when all enforcement efforts have been exhausted.\n\n# Non-D\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
