Respondents who said “don’t know/not applicable” are not shown.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 1,363 participants at all levels of the organization, Feb 22–Mar 5, 2024\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nThe state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\n# McKinsey Commentary\n\n# Michael Chui\n\n# Partner, McKinsey Global Institute\n\nThe rapid pace of adoption of generative AI (gen AI) is reflected in the investments that companies are making in these technologies, with similar percentages of respondents to our survey stating that they are spending at least 5 percent of their digital budgets on gen AI and analytical AI. That said, given the longer track record in analytical AI, larger shares of respondents are spending more than 20 percent of their budgets on analytical AI than on gen AI.\n\nOrganizations are also finding themselves able to deploy gen AI quickly, with the most common project length being less than four months, reflecting the ease of using natural language as an interface. Organizations that are doing more customization or building their own models take longer to bring these systems online.\n\n# Gen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\n\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it’s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations’ EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations’ EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions—though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\n\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions—an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they’re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They’re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\nGen AI high performers are much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management.\n\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\n\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions—that is, to “shift left.” They’re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\n# Exhibit 11\n\nOrganizations seeing the largest returns from\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
