The latest results from 2023 showed that 81% of our employees stated, “I actively contribute to SAP’s sustainability goals.” This is down from 82% in 2022 and up from 47% in 2009 when we introduced the question.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Sustainability Management section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Stakeholder Engagement\n\nFor SAP, stakeholder engagement and collaboration are deeply embedded into our process of innovation and the development of our products and services. Before we can design a new solution, we must first understand the issue we are addressing. This is why we regularly liaise with the stakeholder groups described below, including our sustainability and AI ethics advisory panels.\n\n# Customers\n\nFor more information about our customer engagement programs, see the Customers section.\n\n# Employees\n\nWe survey our employees regularly throughout the year. For the results of our latest employee survey, see the Employees section.\n\nWe strive for constructive labor relations across the world, working within each country’s requirements. We currently have social partners in 37 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. These employee representative bodies consist of elected union members and/or non-union members and are consulted by SAP management mainly on topics that define the work environment and work processes. Collective bargaining agreements with unions are only made in countries where legally required. Overall, about 52% of our employees are represented by works councils or an independent trade union, or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The working conditions and terms of employment of the remaining employees are not influenced or determined based on other collective bargaining agreements. To foster the goal that every SAP employee worldwide can be heard and speak out without fear of retaliation, we have established a Global Ombuds Office which operates as an informal, independent, and confidential channel on top of the formal complaint mechanisms in place, including our Speak Out whistleblower reporting tool. For more information, see the Business Conduct section.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Board answers employees’ questions in quarterly employee meetings. In regular coffee corner sessions, senior executives explain our strategy to employees and answer their questions directly.\n\n# Financial Analysts and Investors\n\nFor more information about our dialog with the financial community (that is, financial analysts, institutional investors, and retail shareholders), see the Investor Relations section.\n\n# Governments\n\nFor more information about our dialog with governments, see the Public Policy section.\n\n# Industry Analysts\n\nOur Analyst Relations team, the Executive Board, and executives have strong relations with industry analysts and engage with them frequently on strategic SAP solutions and services.\n\n# Partners\n\nWith more than 25,500 partners around the world, the SAP ecosystem is vital to our success. We take a multifaceted approach to engagement that begins with the dedicated, interactive SAP Partner Portal. Partners receive regular communications including customized newsletters, training offers, and Web seminars, with the latest announcements and thought leadership relevant to their specific partnership type. Additionally, virtual events are held throughout the year, around the globe, to further gauge partners’ feedback on how SAP can continuously improve.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and Academia\n\nOur ongoing dialog with non-profit organizations (NPOs) and academic institutions plays a crucial role in our understanding of the current challenges we face as a society and how our solutions can address them. Through the SAP University Alliances program, we actively engage with students and faculty members, introducing them to SAP software through various networking and educational activities. By partnering with over 2,800 educational institutions worldwide, we aim to integrate SAP's cutting-edge technology into curricula, enabling students to gain hands-on experience in using software that powers some of the world's largest organizations. This collaboration between SAP and our academic partners puts us in a unique position to equip the next generation with the skills they need to tackle the questions of the future. By providing students with practical experience and exposure to our software, we are nurturing a pool of talent for SAP and our ecosystem that can contribute to solving the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nTo learn more about our engagement with NPOs, see the Social Investments and Our Contribution to the UN SDGs sections of this report. Alternatively, you can visit the SAP University Alliances Web page for more information.\n\n# Sustainability Advisory Panel\n\nIn 2023, the panel discussed key initiatives related to our sustainability management solutions, environmental performance, and human rights. For more information about our Sustainability Advisory Panel, see the Sustainability Management section of this report.\n\n# AI Ethics Advisory Panel\n\nOur AI ethics advisory panel consists of academic, policy, and industry experts who advise us on the development and operationalization of the guiding principles for artificial intelligence. In 2023, we held an in-person, 1.5-day workshop with the panel where topics such as ethical implications of generative AI, human rights and AI, and high-risk use cases, were discussed.
