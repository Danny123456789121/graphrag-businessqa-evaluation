This work draws on interviews with a range of climate change and AI experts, builds on previous research from organizations including Climate Change AI and the AI for the Planet Alliance, and leverages BCG’s analysis and client experience as well as Google’s technical and operational expertise—and its experience in developing solutions.\n\n# 1 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nAccelerating climate action is imperative, as we are on a path to fall short of the Paris Agreement’s goal to keep warming under 1.5° Celsius.\n\n- The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that, based on action to date, the world will likely see warming of 2.8°C with catastrophic consequences.\n\nWhile AI is only just starting to be applied to climate challenges, leading-edge organizations and use cases are already delivering results—and demonstrating the promise of AI for climate—along three dimensions.\n\n- Information. AI-curated information sources are aiding nations in shaping their climate strategy—and in responding to emergencies such as wildfires.\n- The IPCC forecasts that in order to meet the 1.5°C goal, the world will need to reduce emissions—from the baseline of 2010 levels—by 43% by 2030.\n\nBy scaling currently proven applications and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to unlock insights that could help mitigate 5% to 10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030—and significantly bolster climate-related adaptation and resilience initiatives.\n\n- Prediction. AI’s predictive power is helping save lives by offering advance warning of floods.\n- Optimization. AI applications are enabling organizations to understand and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon footprints.1\n\nAI also poses risks that must be considered and managed thoughtfully to ensure its use has a net positive impact on climate.\n\n- 87% of executives view AI as having the potential to address climate issues.\n- AI’s positive impact will be multiplied should it contribute to scientific breakthroughs that open new pathways for climate action.\n\nAI can contribute to climate action by reducing emissions, guiding adaptations to unavoidable climate change impacts, and providing foundational capabilities that enable climate action.\n\n- Mitigation. Helping with both the reduction and removal of emissions—and with the underlying measurement needed to size the challenge and track progress.\n- Adaptation and Resilience. Aiding countries, regions, cities, citizens, and businesses in forecasting climate-related hazards, developing plans to address them, and responding in real time to crises.\n- Foundational Capabilities. Enabling climate-related modeling, research into climate economics, and new approaches to climate education and supporting breakthroughs in fundamental research.\n\nEnergy-Related GHG Emissions. A 2022 paper in Nature Climate Change estimates that cloud and hyperscale data centers are responsible for 0.1%–0.2% of global GHG emissions and that roughly 25% of data center workloads are related to machine learning (ML). Yet, newer and more complex AI models may require more energy. At present, robust forecasts for AI’s future energy requirements remain elusive given uncertain adoption rates and the broad spectrum of potential technical advancements with the potential to decrease AI’s energy intensity. Nonetheless, AI providers are already striving to enhance energy efficiency and integrate clean energy sources.\n\nWater Use. Water-based cooling remains the most energy-efficient option for data centers, and its overall impact on water consumption is low. In 2016 in the US, data centers were estimated to have used less than 0.02% of the country’s water consumption for cooling.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
