We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. We used databases published by institutions including the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to break down about 850 occupations into approximately 2,100 activities, and we determined the performance capabilities needed for each activity based on how humans currently perform them.\n\nUse cases are targeted applications to a specific business challenge that produces one or more measurable outcomes. For example, in marketing, generative AI could be used to generate creative content such as personalized emails.\n\nUnstructured data lack a consistent format or structure (for example, text, images, and audio files) and typically require more advanced techniques to extract insights.\n\n# Generative AI use cases across functions and industries\n\nGenerative AI is a step change in the evolution of artificial intelligence. As companies rush to adapt and implement it, understanding the technology’s potential to deliver value to the economy and society at large will help shape critical decisions. We have used two complementary lenses to determine where generative AI with its current capabilities could deliver the biggest value and how big that value could be (Exhibit 1).\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Exhibit 1\n\nThe potential impact of generative AI can be evaluated through two lenses.\n\n|Lens 1|Lens 2|\n|---|---|\n|Total economic potential of 60-plus organizational use cases1|Labor productivity potential across ~2,100 detailed work activities performed by global workforce|\n|Cost impacts of use cases|Cost impacts of use cases|\n|Revenue impacts of use cases1|Revenue impacts of use cases1|\n\n1 For quantitative analysis, revenue impacts were recast as productivity increases on the corresponding spend in order to maintain comparability with cost impacts and not to assume additional growth in any particular market.\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nThe first lens scans use cases for generative AI that organizations could adopt. We define a “use case” as a targeted application of generative AI to a specific business challenge, resulting in one or more measurable outcomes. For example, a use case in marketing is the application of generative AI to generate creative content such as personalized emails, the measurable outcomes of which potentially include reductions in the cost of generating such content and increases in revenue from the enhanced effectiveness of higher-quality content at scale. We identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could deliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually when applied across industries. That would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we now estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock. (Our previous estimate from 2017 was that AI could deliver $9.5 trillion to $15.4 trillion in economic value.)\n\nOur second lens complements the first by analyzing generative AI’s potential impact on the work activities required in some 850 occupations. We modeled scenarios to estimate when generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 “detailed work activities”—such as “communicating with others about operational plans or activities”—that make up those occupations across the world economy. This enables us to estimate how the current capabilities of generative AI could affect labor productivity across all work currently done by the global workforce.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nSome of this impact will overlap with cost reductions in the use case analysis described above, which we assume are the result of improved labor productivity. Netting out this overlap, the total economic benefits of generative AI—including the major use cases we explored and the myriad increases in productivity that are likely to materialize when the technology is applied across knowledge workers’ activities—amounts to $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion annually (Exhibit 2).\n\n# Exhibit 2\n\nGenerative AI could create additional value potential above what could be unlocked by other AI and analytics.\n\nAI’s potential impact on the global economy, $ trillion\n\n| |17.1–25.6|\n|---|---|\n| |13.6–22.1|\n|6.1–7.9| |\n|11.0–17.7|2.6–4.4|\n|~15–40% incremental economic impact|~15–40% incremental economic impact|\n|~35–70% incremental economic impact|~35–70% incremental economic impact|\n|Advanced analytics, traditional machine learning, and deep learning|New generative AI use cases|\n|Total use case-driven potential|All worker productivity enabled by generative AI, including in use cases|\n|Total AI economic potential|Total AI economic potential|\n\n1Updated use case estimates from \"Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nWhile generative AI is an exciting and rapidly advancing technology, the other applications of AI discussed in our previous report continue to account for the majority of the overall potential value of AI. Traditional advanced-analytics and machine learning algorithms are highly effective at performing numerical and optimization tasks such as predictive modeling, and they continue to find new applications in a wide range of industries. However, as generative AI continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please see Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).\n\n# Box 1\n\n# How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases\n\nTo assess the potential value of generative AI, we\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
