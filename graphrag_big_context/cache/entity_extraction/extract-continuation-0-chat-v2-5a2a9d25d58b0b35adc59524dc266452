Most of our employees are of academic background and have sedentary, intellectually demanding jobs in a constantly changing business environment with specifically high demands on self-organization, international collaboration, flexibility, agility, and adaptability. Key health and safety management focus areas at SAP are stress management, self-management, work-life balance support, personal resilience, a psychologically safe work environment, an ergonomically safe office setup, travel medicine, pandemic management, vaccinations, road safety, and general medical prevention for all.\n\n# Employees\n\nSAP provides manifold feedback opportunities and encourages its people to get involved and shape SAP’s caring culture and working conditions by “telling it like it is,” and in doing so, help us improve where needed. Our success is tracked through the Business Health Culture Index (BHCI) and the Stress-Satisfaction Score (measured by regular employee surveys), which revealed that job satisfaction was equal or higher than the perceived stress for about 74% of SAP participants in 2023.\n\n# SAP Health & Safety Commitment Statement\n\nConditions in which people live up to their full potential – now and in the future of work – are mainly defined by the organization’s leadership style and working culture. We believe that there can be no organizational health without individual health. SAP and its leaders take ownership for workplaces and a caring culture that foster physical health, safety, and mental well-being, while every employee is enabled and encouraged to take care of their individual health.\n\nThe Global Health, Safety & Well-Being team (led by SAP’s Chief Medical Officer), together with their partners in Human Resources, Real Estate and Facilities, Occupational Safety and Physical Security, provide the information, education, and support to foster a healthy working culture and a supporting environment for all people. In doing so, we enable the organization to be a role model in safe, healthy, and sustainable people management.\n\n305/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n|GRI Standards|Disclosure Title|Links, Content, and Omissions|In Scope of External Audit|UN SDGs|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|GRI 403:|403-1 Occupational health and safety|SAP has developed an internal health and safety management system called “Run Healthy” which is built on International Labour Organization Occupational Health and Safety (ILO-OSH) standards and SAP's internal Health & Safety Policy. Run Healthy enables SAP organizations to assess their maturity state on health, safety, and well-being to develop and drive targeted initiatives across their organizations and to boost their local Business Health Culture Index, employee engagement, and employer attractivity. The implementation is voluntary and driven by the managing director according to country/line-of-business needs. We give all workers access to global offerings which are complemented according to local business needs. Local Run Healthy councils are key in the process to self-assess maturity levels in the light of covering local requirements and global standards. Run Healthy is expanded on a continuous basis. In addition, SAP engages with its suppliers, partners, and customers to promote the topics of people health and occupational safety beyond the boundaries of our company.

Mental health is key to SAP’s ability to provide innovative solutions for our customers. SAP has a long tradition in taking action against stigmatization and applying the Employee Care Cycle covering prevention, early detection, case management, and re-integration. With the Stress-Satisfaction Score, SAP is monitoring an early-watch KPI to measure resilience on people level and to detect fields of action on individual and organizational level. In 2023, we conducted a hybrid-work-related risk assessment to identify health risk factors while working hybrid. A “Country Health Dashboard” based on SAP Analytics Cloud supports the identification of health risks on country level. SAP relies on the enablement of internal multiplier networks such as the Health Ambassador Network, and external trainings and certifications to ensure health and safety competence across the organization. Our employees can use various tools to report concerns, as outlined in the Human Rights Commitment Statement, and are protected against retaliation. This document is core to our people-related policies, such as the Global Health and Safety Policy. For more information, see the Employees section.
