When combined with other technologies, automation overall could contribute 0.5 to 3.4 percent annually to productivity growth, assuming labor is redeployed at todayâ€™s productivity levels and not including general equilibrium effects.\n\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*NET; McKinsey analysis\n\nWe assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. Our analysis covers 47 countries representing more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net data set that maps about 850 occupations to approximately 2,100 detailed work activities.\n\nEach detailed work activity was assessed against 18 capabilities that could potentially be automated based on the level of performance necessary to successfully perform that activity. These assessments were informed by academic research, McKinsey expertise, and industry experts. We defined four possible levels of requirement for each capability, ranging from not required to top-quartile human performance. Please refer to exhibits A1 to A4 of the technical appendix in the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity for more details on the capabilities and the four requirement levels.\n\n# 1. Modeling of automation adoption timelines\n\nOur adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity level for more than 850 occupations across 19 sectors and 47 countries that represent more than 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process into four phases: technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-user adoption.\n\n# Technical feasibility\n\nFor a detailed work activity to be automated, technology must exist that performs at the required level for each of the 18 capabilities. To update the progression scenarios for the performance capabilities over time, we surveyed experts in generative AI. We also conducted interviews with industry leaders and academic experts. Based on these assessments, we updated the expected time frames to reach each level of performance for each capability. In our analysis and interaction with experts, we focused on the following capabilities that could be affected by generative AI:\n\n- Natural-language understanding\n- Natural-language generation\n- Social and emotional reasoning\n- Emotional and social output\n- Social and emotional sensing\n- Coordination with multiple agents\n- Generating novel patterns or categories\n- Creativity\n\nJobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EDWARD W.
