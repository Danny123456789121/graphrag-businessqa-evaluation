Group liquidity on December 31, 2023, primarily comprised amounts in euros and U.S. dollars.\n\nThe net increase in group liquidity compared to 2022 was mainly due to the Qualtrics divestiture, compensated by the acquisition of LeanIX, the share buyback program, and the repayment of Eurobonds, loans, and commercial paper.\n\nNet liquidity/net debt is group liquidity less financial debt.
