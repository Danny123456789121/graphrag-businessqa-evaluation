Calculation of emissions is based on actual distance traveled and actual costs spent. This data is used to determine an average emission factor per euro spent based on short, medium, and long-haul flight emission factors. For CO2e calculation, this factor is applied to actual costs for business flights. Emission factors for business flights do not consider the radiative forcing factors.\n\n# Rental Cars\n\nEmissions caused by business trips by rental car. An average emission factor from rental cars is calculated based on actual distance traveled and actual costs spent. This average emission factor is used for extrapolation based on the costs.\n\n# Train Travel\n\nEmissions from business trips by train. An average emission factor from train travel is calculated based on actual distance traveled and actual costs spent. This average factor is used for extrapolation based on costs. In Germany, business trips by train are considered carbon neutral as they are compensated with 100% green electricity by Deutsche Bahn.\n\n# Business Trips with Private Cars\n\nEmissions from business trips with employee-owned cars and company cars without fuel card. Carbon calculation is based on distance traveled with the car. Company car trips with fuel cards are excluded from this activity type.\n\n285/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– Employee Commuting: Emissions caused by commuting between home and work at an SAP office location. Considered are all modes of transport, excluding commuters with company cars. An SAP-global, Qualtrics-based commuting survey about the distance to work and the mode of transport is conducted to collect relevant data. The latest commuting survey was conducted in 2022 for which we received approximately 30,000 valid responses. These responses are the basis for our carbon calculation of employee commuting and home office electricity in 2023. Commuting data for non-responding employees and quarterly updates are extrapolated based on the number of FTEs, excluding those employees who have a company car.\n\n– Electricity Consumed by Hyperscale Services: Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity resulting from the usage of hyperscale services in providers’ hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers enable massive, efficient, and robust scalability of computing, system, and server architecture in order to respond to the increasing demand for cloud computing and Big Data solutions. Electricity consumption is calculated based on the total allocated server memory (RAM) and the operating processor hours (CPU) of all hyperscale services. Conversion factors are used to convert the allocated RAM and CPU values into a power value, and an average PUE factor is used to extrapolate the total hyperscale service electricity. For more information about the consideration of renewable energy sources in the calculation, see the External Reductions section.\n\n– Logistics: This category consists of the following three emission sources: 1) Emissions caused by mail and parcel delivery; 2) Emissions caused by the consumption of paper; and 3) Emissions caused by our customers downloading software data from our servers (prior to 2021, this was a downstream emissions category). Due to the insignificant emissions impact of these sources, calculation is done based on an average factor ‘carbon emissions per FTE.’ This factor has been determined based on historical emissions data of each category.\n\n# Net Zero 2030\n\nWe aim to reach net zero across our value chain in line with a 1.5°C future by 2030. The net zero 2030 target is planned for submission to the SBTi in 2024. The baseline for the net zero target consists of SAP’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions as explained above except for the emissions from air conditioning devices in corporate cars as these emissions are very insignificant compared to SAP’s total footprint. The Scope 3 emissions taken into account for net zero are described below. We measure the Scope 3 carbon emissions based on the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\n# Upstream Scope 3\n\n– Purchased Goods and Services: Includes all significant cradle-to-gate upstream emissions of goods and services that SAP purchased during the reporting period. We also include services from waste and water disposal in this category. Furthermore, the Purchased Goods and Services category includes the services from our hyperscaler providers, fuel- and energy-related activities, and upstream transportation and distribution. In contrast to the carbon neutrality 2023 target, we consider all significant cradle-to-gate emissions for the net zero 2030 target. Therefore, we apply a different calculation approach for all purchased goods and services. To derive the CO2e, SAP closely collaborates with a third-party provider that utilizes a spend-based method. We use coefficients that translate each US$ of spend into kilogram of CO2e. The coefficients are available for each country-sector combination and by supply chain tier (direct suppliers, suppliers of suppliers, and so on).\n\n– Capital Goods: Includes all cradle-to-gate upstream emissions of purchased capital goods, such as buildings, data center and IT equipment, cars, and so on. SAP applies the same calculation logic as described above in the section Purchased Goods and Services.\n\n– Business Travel: Includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions of transportation of employees for business-related activities during the reporting year not owned or operated by SAP. The main components are emissions from business flights, rental cars, train travel, and business trips with private cars. The calculation approach is the same as outlined above in the Carbon Neutrality 2023 section.\n\n286/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– Employee Commuting:\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that aims to reach net zero across its value chain by 2030 and is involved in various sustainability initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEUTSCHE BAHN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deutsche Bahn is the German railway company that provides carbon-neutral train travel by using 100% green electricity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS TRIPS<|>EVENT<|>Business trips refer to travel undertaken for work-related purposes, which can include flights, rental cars, and train travel, contributing to carbon emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON NEUTRALITY 2023<|>EVENT<|>A target set by SAP to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations by the year 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO 2030<|>EVENT<|>A target set by SAP to achieve net zero emissions across its value chain by the year 2030.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG PROTOCOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The GHG Protocol is a widely used international accounting tool for government and business leaders to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBTi<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling companies to set ambitious emissions reductions targets in line with climate science.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>DEUTSCHE BAHN<|>SAP collaborates with Deutsche Bahn to promote carbon-neutral travel options for business trips<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>BUSINESS TRIPS<|>SAP's business trips contribute to its overall carbon emissions, which it aims to reduce through various initiatives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>CARBON NEUTRALITY 2023<|>SAP has set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2023, which includes reducing emissions from business trips<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>NET ZERO 2030<|>SAP aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, which encompasses all aspects of its operations, including business travel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GHG PROTOCOL<|>SAP uses the GHG Protocol to measure and report its greenhouse gas emissions as part of its sustainability efforts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>SBTi<|>SAP plans to submit its net zero target to the SBTi for validation in 2024<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
