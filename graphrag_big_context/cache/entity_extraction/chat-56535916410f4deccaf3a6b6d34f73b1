Thus, they are subcomponents of our overall remaining performance obligations following IFRS 15.120. For our committed cloud business, we believe the TCB and the CCB are valuable indicators of our go-to-market success, as they reflect both new contracts won and existing contracts renewed. For more information on how we calculate these numbers, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (A.1).\n\nAs an additional metric, we used SAP S/4HANA CCB to measure the contractually committed cloud core ERP revenue we expect to recognize over the upcoming 12 months as of a specific key date. Starting in 2024, we will no longer disclose SAP S/4HANA CCB.\n\n# Cloud gross profit (non-IFRS):\n\nWe use cloud gross profit (non-IFRS) expressed in both actual currencies and constant currencies to measure the process efficiency and performance of our cloud business.\n\n# Operating profit (non-IFRS):\n\nWe use operating profit (non-IFRS) expressed in both actual currencies and constant currencies to measure our overall operational process efficiency and overall business performance.\n\n# Cloud gross margin (non-IFRS):\n\nWe use our cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) to measure our process efficiency in our cloud business. Cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) is the ratio of our cloud gross profit (non-IFRS) to cloud revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n\n# Operating margin (non-IFRS):\n\nWe use operating margin (non-IFRS) to measure our overall operational process efficiency. Operating margin (non-IFRS) is the ratio of our operating profit (non-IFRS) to total revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n\n# Measures to Manage Our Non-Operating Financial Performance\n\nWe used the following supporting measure to provide insight into our non-operating financial performance:\n\n# Financial income, net (IFRS and non-IFRS):\n\nThis measure provides insight into the return on liquid assets and capital investments, and the cost of borrowed funds. To manage our financial income, net, we focus on cash flow, the composition of our liquid assets and capital investment portfolio, and the average rate of interest at which liquid assets and capital investments are invested. We also monitor average outstanding borrowings and associated finance costs.\n\n# Measures to Manage Overall Financial Performance\n\nWe used free cash flow as the key measure to manage our overall financial performance. In addition to that, we used several supporting measures to provide further insight into our overall financial performance:\n\n# Earnings per share (EPS) (IFRS and non-IFRS)\n\nEPS (basic and diluted) measures our overall performance because it captures all operating and non-operating elements of profit as well as income tax expense. It represents the portion of profit after tax attributable to equity holders of SAP SE allocable to each SAP share outstanding. EPS is influenced not only by our operating and non-operating business and income taxes but also by the number of shares outstanding.\n\n# Effective tax rate (IFRS and non-IFRS):\n\nWe define our effective tax rate as the ratio of income tax expense to profit before tax, expressed as a percentage.\n\n16 We report earnings per share for our continuing operations, and total earnings per share for our continuing and discontinued operations.\n\n58/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOperating, investing, and financing cash flows and free cash flow: Our consolidated statements of cash flows provide insight into how we generated and used cash and cash equivalents. When applied in conjunction with the other primary financial statements, it provides information that helps us evaluate the changes in our net assets, our financial structure (including our liquidity and solvency), and our ability to affect the amounts and timing of cash flows to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities. We use our free cash flow measure to determine the cash flow remaining after all expenditures required to maintain or expand our organic business have been paid off. This measure provides management with supplemental information to assess our liquidity needs. We calculate free cash flow as net cash from operating activities minus purchases (other than purchases made in connection with business combinations) of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as well as payments of lease liabilities.\n\n# Measures to Manage Our Non-Financial Performance\n\nIn the reporting year, we used the Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS), Employee Engagement Index, and net carbon emissions as our key measures to manage our non-financial performance. In addition to these, we used the Leadership Trust NPS as a supporting measure to provide further insight into our non-financial performance:\n\n# Customer NPS\n\nThe annual assessment of customer loyalty is based on a survey that includes the Customer NPS metric. The Customer NPS score is calculated based on the “Likelihood to Recommend” question with its proprietary scoring, identified on a scale of 0–10. We use this measure because we believe that we can only achieve our financial goals when our customers are loyal to, and satisfied with, SAP\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
