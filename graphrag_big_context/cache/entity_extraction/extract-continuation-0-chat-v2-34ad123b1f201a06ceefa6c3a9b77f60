Cloud revenue growth benefitted from the accelerated transition of our customers to the cloud. The transactional cloud revenue remained approximately at the level of the previous year. Cloud revenue for Cloud ERP Suite increased 29%, or €2,417 million, to €10,626 million in 2023 (2022: €8,209 million). For more information about Cloud ERP Suite, see the Performance Management System section.\n\nThe current cloud backlog increased €2,721 million, or 25%, to €13,745 million in 2023 (2022: €11,024 million).\n\nOur software licenses revenue declined €292 million from €2,056 million in 2022 to €1,764 million in 2023. The demand for SAP software helped us maintain a stable maintenance customer base for software support, resulting in software support revenue of €11,496 million in 2023 (2022: €11,909 million). The slight decline is attributable to the accelerated transition of our customers to the cloud and to unfavorable currency exchange rates. SAP Enterprise Support was the largest contributor to our software support revenue.\n\nSoftware licenses and software support revenue decreased €705 million, or 5%, from €13,965 million in 2022 to €13,261 million in 2023.\n\n# More Predictable Revenue1\n\n€ millions\n\n| |2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Software support|11,547|11,506|11,412|11,909|11,496|\n|Cloud|6,933|8,080|8,701|11,426|13,664|\n|Total| | | | |25,160|\n\n1 The numbers for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect continuing operations as a result of the divestiture of Qualtrics.\n\nWe define more predictable revenue as the sum of our cloud revenue and our software support revenue. Our more predictable revenue increased from €23,335 million in 2022 to €25,160 million in 2023. Cloud revenue surpassed support revenue in 2023 and drove the growth of 8%. More predictable revenue accounted for 81% of our total revenue in 2023 (2022: 79%), continuing the upward trend from prior years.\n\n72/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nServices revenue combines revenue from consulting services, premium support services, and other services such as training services. Consulting services primarily relate to the implementation of our cloud and on-premise software products. Our premium support offering consists of high-end support services tailored to customer requirements. For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (A.1).\n\nServices revenue increased €155 million, or 4%, from €4,128 million in 2022 to €4,283 million in 2023. This increase was predominantly caused by very strong growth across the entire services portfolio of offerings with accelerated growth in our premium support revenues. At the same time, the revenue development was positively impacted by a year-over-year increase in order entry.\n\nConsulting revenue and premium support revenue increased €165 million, or 4%, from €3,709 million in 2022 to €3,874 million in 2023. In 2023, consulting and premium support revenue contributed 90% of the total services revenue (2022: 90%) and 12% of total revenue (2022: 13%). Revenue from other services decreased €10 million, or 2%, to €409 million in 2023 (2022: €419 million).\n\n# Revenue by Region\n\n|Revenue by Region (Based on Customer Location)|€ millions|\n|---|---|\n|EMEA|14,004|\n|Americas|12,762|\n|APJ|4,441|\n\n# EMEA Region\n\nIn 2023, the EMEA region generated €14,004 million in revenue (2022: €12,909 million), which was 45% of total revenue (2022: 44%).
