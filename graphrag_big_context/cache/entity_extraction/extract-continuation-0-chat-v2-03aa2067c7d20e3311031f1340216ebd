The use of the facility is not restricted by any financial covenants. Borrowings under the facility bear interest of EURIBOR or the agreed benchmark rate for the respective currency plus a base margin which might be adjusted depending on the fulfillment of agreed sustainability performance targets. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 7bps per annum on the unused available credit. We have not drawn on the facility.\n\nIn September 2019, we initiated a commercial paper (Commercial Paper, or CP) program. As at December 31, 2023, we had €0 million of CP outstanding with maturities generally less than six months (2022: €930 million).\n\nAdditionally, as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Group had available lines of credit totaling €555 million and €555 million, respectively. There were immaterial borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit in all years presented.\n\n# Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\nThe table below is an analysis of the remaining contractual maturities of all our financial liabilities and guarantees held as at December 31, 2023. Financial liabilities for which repayment can be requested by the contract partner at any time are assigned to the earliest possible period. Variable interest payments were calculated using the latest relevant interest rate fixed as at December 31, 2023. As we generally settle our derivative contracts gross, we show the pay and receive legs separately for all our currency and interest rate derivatives, whether or not the fair value of the derivative is negative. The cash outflows for the currency derivatives are translated using the applicable spot rate. We continue to provide rental guarantees for certain offices used by Qualtrics. The amounts shown for the financial guarantees are the gross amounts we guarantee, however, we are entitled to indemnification payments by Qualtrics which will reduce the guarantee amounts disclosed.\n\n# Contractual Maturities of Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities\n\n|€ millions|Carrying Amount|Contractual Cash Flows|2024|2025|2026|2027|2028|Thereafter|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Non-derivative financial liabilities| | | | | | | | |\n|Trade payables|–1,022|–1,022|0|0|0|0|0| |\n|Bonds|–6,780|–941|–952|–1,161|–1,045|–1,033|–2,604| |\n|Private placements|–388|–305|–3|–3|–94|0|0| |\n|Loans|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| |\n|Commercial paper|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| |\n|Lease liabilities|–1,621|–350|–260|–204|–159|–127|–804| |\n|Other financial liabilities1|–263|–34|–30|0|0|0|0| |\n|Total of non-derivative financial liabilities|–10,075|–2,652|–1,245|–1,368|–1,298|–1,160|–3,408| |\n|Financial guarantees|0|–19|–19|–19|–19|–19|–309| |\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Carrying Amount\n\n|€ millions|Amount|12/31/2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|2027|Thereafter|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Non-derivative financial liabilities|Trade payables|–1,496|–1,496|0|0|0|0|0|\n| |Bonds|–8,155|–1,690|–941|–962|–1,162|–1,045|–3,636|\n| |Private placements|–405|–14|–316|–3|–3|–97|0|\n| |Loans|–1,456|–1,479|0|0|0|0|0|\n| |Commercial paper|–928|–932|0|0|0|0|0|\n| |Lease liabilities|–2,140|–398|–317|–257|–228|–188|–1,071|\n| |Other financial liabilities1|–422|–307|–31|0|0|0|0|\n| |Total of non-derivative financial liabilities|–15,002|–6,316|–1,605|–1,222|–1,393|–1,330|–4,707|\n| |Financial guarantees|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|\n\n1 The carrying amount of Other financial liabilities includes accrued interest for our non-derivative financial debt as well as\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP SE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP SE is a multinational software corporation that specializes in enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, and it has entered into a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUALTRICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Qualtrics is a company that provides experience management software and is mentioned in relation to rental guarantees provided by SAP SE.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is the continent where SAP SE operates and is relevant to the financial transactions mentioned in the text.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY<|>EVENT<|>The sustainability-linked revolving credit facility is a financial arrangement entered into by SAP SE in 2023, amounting to €3.0 billion with terms extending until 2028.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMERCIAL PAPER<|>EVENT<|>The commercial paper program initiated by SAP SE in September 2019 allows for short-term borrowing, with no outstanding amounts as of December 31, 2023.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>QUALTRICS<|>SAP SE provides rental guarantees for certain offices used by Qualtrics, indicating a financial relationship<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY<|>SAP SE entered into a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in 2023 to enhance financial flexibility<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>COMMERCIAL PAPER<|>SAP SE initiated a commercial paper program to manage short-term financing needs<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
