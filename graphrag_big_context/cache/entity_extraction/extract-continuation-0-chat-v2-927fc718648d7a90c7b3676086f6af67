After all, people may wish to make climate-friendly choices but lack the information to know, for example, the relative carbon footprint of two pairs of jeans. By providing relevant information, AI can help consumers make environmentally conscious choices. For example, Google Maps uses AI to suggest fuel-efficient routes that have fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA. The feature is available in the US, Canada, Europe, and Egypt and will be rolling out in India and Indonesia during 2023. In India and Indonesia, the feature will be expanded to two-wheelers, helping even more people to travel more sustainably.\n\n# Innovation and Breakthroughs\n\nAI can also accelerate breakthrough innovation in domains that could open new frontiers in the battle against climate change. For instance, in the field of material science, AI has already aided the discovery of a new family of solid-state materials that conduct lithium. These solid electrolytes will be helpful in the development of solid-state batteries that offer longer ranges and increased safety for electric vehicles. In the field of clean energy, Google DeepMind has pioneered a deep reinforcement learning system that helps researchers better control nuclear fusion plasma, opening new avenues to advance fusion research and thus clean energy alternatives. (See the sidebar Accelerating Fusion Science through Better Plasma Control.)\n\nI is clearly poised to play a pivotal role in shaping positive climate outcomes. But, alongside its benefits, it is crucial to also acknowledge the potential risks associated with its implementation. The next chapter offers some perspective.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE 18\n\n# Helping Lagos Shape Its Strategy for Climate-Related Adaptation and Resilience\n\nLagos is one of Africa’s most populous urban areas. It is also home to the continent’s fourth-busiest port and contributes around 30% of Nigeria’s GDP. At an average elevation of only 1.5 meters above sea level—and with much of the city at or below sea level—it is also one of the cities most endangered by rising sea levels.\n\nBut Lagos has set itself on a journey to build a more resilient future, leveraging data and analytics to build a robust adaptation and resilience plan that addresses the impact of extreme weather on its key systems. The plan is guiding the city to mobilize financing and implement effective governance, legislation, and monitoring capabilities.\n\nAI-enabled tools have played a central role in guiding Lagos’s journey—first, in risk assessment and then in shaping and prioritizing strategies. Lagos’s risk assessment was based mainly on four key indicators: flood intensity, capital cost to damaged infrastructure, impact of extreme events on GDP, and the number of citizens affected. The data is calibrated in increments of only 500 square meters—small enough to show fine-grained patterns of climate vulnerability. Overall, the model estimated 165 square kilometers would likely be inundated, 700,000 residents would need to be relocated, and there would be $5 billion in damage to transport, communications, and power infrastructure. The heat map below shows the model’s prediction of inundation risk, with the red areas the most vulnerable.\n\nThese AI-powered tools then enabled Lagos’s leaders to simulate the relative contribution of different strategies under multiple scenarios. It also helped estimate the cost of inaction, which, at about $30 billion, represents 12 times the budget of the Lagos metropolitan area.\n\nBy utilizing these tools, policymakers have curated a prioritized portfolio of projects spanning three broad areas. One of these areas concentrates on enhancing infrastructure resilience, exemplified by initiatives such as the construction of an 18 km embankment and sea walls designed to safeguard more than 2.7 million individuals, including 700,000 from vulnerable populations. Another revolves around bolstering community resilience and safeguarding vulnerable groups, with initiatives such as the establishment of infectious disease surveillance systems. And the third factor centers on proactively addressing risks and enhancing crisis response capabilities, such as the establishment of well-defined post-disaster procedures.\n\nThe city has actively engaged with a diverse array of stakeholders from the public, private, and social sectors. Currently, it is in the process of implementing its Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan while securing funding from various sources including the private sector, public sector, NGOs, and others.\n\n# Application area: Climate Modeling, Climate Economics, and Adaptation and Resilience\n\n# Inundation risk heat map for Lagos\n\nSource: BCG Climate Impact AI Platform.\n\n19 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Sprout: Helping Smallholder Coffee Farmers Navigate Climate Change\n\nCoffee production faces a significant threat from the extreme temperatures and unpredictable rainfall that are a result of climate change. Small farms are particularly vulnerable. And many are seeing declines in yields of up to 15% as a consequence—yet few have access to or can afford crop insurance.\n\nSprout, an insurtech startup, offers an innovative, AI-driven solution that helps farmers navigate risks and withstand full or partial crop failures resulting from extreme climate conditions. Sprout brings its own proprietary data on coffee farming together with data from satellites and other sources to do two things that support smallholder farmers.\n\nFirst, via the Sprout mobile app, it offers locally customized agronomy advice to farmers on how best to navigate unexpected weather trends. This reduces intra-seasonal risks, thereby requiring less insurance cover. Second, via an innovative index insurance offering, Sprout helps alleviate downside impacts. Premiums are paid by the farmers’ direct customers—and ultimately by developed-world coffee consumers. Index insurance doesn’t require farmers to file claims to receive compensation. Instead, it provides automatic payouts should an index variable for the local area (for example, rainfall) fall below a target value. Sprout is piloting its Climate Smart CoffeeTM program with support from USAID Development Innovation Ventures in Kenya.\n\nSprout aspires to offer protection to over 1 million farmers worldwide by 2030.\n\n# Application area: Climate Economics\n\n# Spr\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can influence climate-friendly behavior and provide relevant information to consumers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE MAPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Maps is a navigation service that uses AI to suggest fuel-efficient routes to users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGYPT<|>GEO<|>Egypt is a country where Google Maps' AI fuel-efficient routing feature is available.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where Google Maps' AI fuel-efficient routing feature will be rolled out in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDONESIA<|>GEO<|>Indonesia is a country where Google Maps' AI fuel-efficient routing feature will be rolled out in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston Consulting Group is a global management consulting firm that provides insights on climate-related strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGOS<|>GEO<|>Lagos is one of Africa’s most populous urban areas and is developing a climate adaptation and resilience plan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGERIA<|>GEO<|>Nigeria is the country where Lagos is located and contributes around 30% of its GDP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USAID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USAID is a U.S. government agency that provides support for development initiatives, including those related to climate adaptation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPROUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sprout is an insurtech startup that offers AI-driven solutions to help smallholder coffee farmers navigate climate change risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENYA<|>GEO<|>Kenya is a country where Sprout is piloting its Climate Smart Coffee program.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE MAPS<|>AI<|>Google Maps utilizes AI technology to suggest fuel-efficient routes to users<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGOS<|>NIGERIA<|>Lagos is a major urban area in Nigeria, contributing significantly to the country's GDP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGOS<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>Boston Consulting Group is assisting Lagos in shaping its climate-related adaptation and resilience strategy<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPROUT<|>USAID<|>Sprout is receiving support from USAID for its Climate Smart Coffee program in Kenya<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPROUT<|>LAGOS<|>Sprout's initiatives could potentially benefit smallholder farmers in Lagos as part of climate adaptation efforts<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>GOOGLE MAPS<|>Google Maps is expanding its AI fuel-efficient routing feature to India in 2023<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDONESIA<|>GOOGLE MAPS<|>Google Maps is expanding its AI fuel-efficient routing feature to Indonesia in 2023<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGYPT<|>GOOGLE MAPS<|>Google Maps' AI fuel-efficient routing feature is currently available in Egypt<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
