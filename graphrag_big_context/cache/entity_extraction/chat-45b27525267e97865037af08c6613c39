The technology has already gained traction in customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using natural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service agents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and reduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent. It also reduced agent attrition and requests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled agents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.\n\n# Examples of Operational Improvements\n\n- # Customer Self-Service\n\nGenerative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and personalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or location of the customer. By improving the quality and effectiveness of interactions via automated channels, generative AI could automate responses to a higher percentage of customer inquiries, enabling customer care teams to take on inquiries that can only be resolved by a human agent. Our research found that roughly half of customer contacts made by banking, telecommunications, and utilities companies in North America are already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50 percent, depending on a company’s existing level of automation.\n- # Resolution During Initial Contact\n\nGenerative AI can instantly retrieve data a company has on a specific customer, which can help a human customer service representative more successfully answer questions and resolve issues during an initial interaction.\n- # Reduced Response Time\n\nGenerative AI can cut the time a human sales representative spends responding to a customer by providing assistance in real time and recommending next steps.\n- # Increased Sales\n\nBecause of its ability to rapidly process data on customers and their browsing histories, the technology can identify product suggestions and deals tailored to customer preferences. Additionally, generative AI can enhance quality assurance and coaching by gathering insights from customer conversations, determining what could be done better, and coaching agents.\n\nWe estimate that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase productivity at a value ranging from 30 to 45 percent of current function costs. Our analysis captures only the direct impact generative AI might have on the productivity of customer operations. It does not account for potential knock-on effects the technology may have on customer satisfaction and retention arising from an improved experience, including better understanding of the customer’s context that can assist human agents in providing more personalized help and recommendations.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# How marketing and sales could be transformed\n\n# Strategization\n\nSales and marketing professionals efficiently gather market trends and customer information from unstructured data sources (for example, social media, news, research, product information, and customer feedback) and draft effective marketing and sales communications.\n\n# Awareness\n\nCustomers see campaigns tailored to their segment, language, and demographic.\n\n# Consideration\n\nCustomers can access comprehensive information, comparisons, and dynamic recommendations, such as personal “try ons.”\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Conversion\n\nVirtual sales representatives enabled by generative AI emulate humanlike qualities—such as empathy, personalized communication, and natural language processing—to build trust and rapport with customers.\n\n# Retention\n\nCustomers are more likely to be retained with customized messages and rewards, and they can interact with AI-powered customer-support chatbots that manage the relationship proactively, with fewer escalations to human agents.\n\n# Marketing and sales\n\nGenerative AI has taken hold rapidly in marketing and sales functions, in which text-based communications and personalization at scale are driving forces. The technology can create personalized messages tailored to individual customer interests, preferences, and behaviors, as well as do tasks such as producing first drafts of brand advertising, headlines, slogans, social media posts, and product descriptions.\n\nHowever, introducing generative AI to marketing functions requires careful consideration. For one thing, mathematical models trained on publicly available data without sufficient safeguards against plagiarism, copyright violations, and branding recognition risks infringing on intellectual property rights. A virtual try-on application may produce biased representations of certain demographics because of limited or biased training data. Thus, significant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each company’s needs.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n17\n\n# Potential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following:\n\n- Efficient and effective content creation. Generative AI could significantly reduce the time required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also facilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, writing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
