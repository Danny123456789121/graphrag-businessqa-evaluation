In this context, we determine SAP’s greenhouse gas footprint (in the following called carbon emissions) as well as total energy consumed and data center electricity as the three key environmental performance indicators. Furthermore, we realize external compensations through self-generated renewable electricity and by purchasing offsets and Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Plus, we identify water consumption and the end-of-life treatment of SAP’s electrical and electronic equipment as additional environmental topics relevant for our reporting.\n\nOur gross carbon emissions for 2023 were 472 kilotons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) (2022: 441 kilotons CO2e), including all carbon emission categories of Scope 1 and 2, as well as selected categories of Scope 3 relevant for our carbon neutrality target as described in Methodology and Further Details below. Our net carbon emissions (0 kilotons in 2023) are calculated by deducting purchased EACs, self-generated renewable electricity, and carbon offsets from our gross emissions in the reporting period. We disclose various environmental performance indicators, including carbon neutral-relevant Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in the Report Data Hub82.\n\n# Reporting Approach\n\nData for our environmental indicators is collected and reported on a quarterly basis and is subject to external assurance for annual reporting (limited or reasonable assurance). Reporting on total energy consumed and data center electricity is based on the data collected for the calculation of our carbon emissions. All numbers are based on the metric system. Whenever we state “tons,” we mean metric tons.\n\n# Carbon Emissions\n\n# Definition\n\nWe define the gross carbon emissions as the sum of all greenhouse gas emissions, measured and reported as CO2e, while net carbon emissions include the compensation with renewable electricity2 and carbon offsets (for more information, see External Reductions below).\n\n# Reporting Principles\n\nSAP’s preparation of the carbon emissions is based on the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard of the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. This approach conforms to the requirements of GRI Standard indicators 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3.\n\nIn alignment with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, we report our net carbon emissions based on the two different calculation approaches: location-based and market-based.\n\n81 Link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Junior Achievement is a non-profit
