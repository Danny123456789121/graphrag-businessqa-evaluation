We overcome the maturity challenge through peer learning and exchange sessions at the VBA and by taking a sensitivity analysis approach where we determine the impacts across a broad range of valuation coefficients.\n\n# Examples of Business Steering Based on VBA Methodologies\n\nWe disclosed a selection of the results of the VBA’s third methodology piloting exercise, which ended in November 2022, in our Integrated Report published in March 2023. In 2023, we leveraged these results and learnings to steer a number of our internal sustainability programs, which are mentioned below.\n\n- Materiality analysis: In 2023, we revisited our materiality analysis to identify and prioritize key material topics. The VBA pilot analysis, which shows prioritized issues based on our procurement spend, was used as one of the sources to identify material issues for SAP. This data-driven, quantitative result complemented the qualitative approach generally used for materiality analyses, further improving quality and completeness.\n- Compensation cycle adjustment: In 2023, we integrated the concept of “living wages” into our annual compensation review process.\n- Human rights due diligence: The upstream hotspot analysis using monetized values for social indicators was an integral part of our annual risk assessment in the context of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. The monetary valuation allowed us to set thresholds universally across different metrics to identify low, medium, or high risks.\n- Net zero 2030 and internal carbon pricing: We used the pilot results to update the emission baseline figures for our net zero 2030 target. In addition, the current social cost of carbon value set by the VBA, which is US$223 per ton of greenhouse gas (GHG), was used as the reference to update our internal carbon pricing. This brought the internal carbon price closer to the social cost of carbon than in previous years.\n\n# 2023 VBA Piloting and Results\n\nEnding in December 2023, our fourth VBA pilot analyzed metrics including GHG emissions, water consumption, GDP contribution, and training. We used data from our Integrated Report 2022, internal controlling and HR systems, and our environmental management system. The analysis primarily focused on our own operations and our supply chain. In addition, we piloted a limited scope of our downstream impacts looking at GHG impacts from our on-premise software installations. Wherever possible, we used primary data for calculations. Where primary data was not available, we used proxies, modeling techniques, and assumptions that were well-defined and documented in the VBA method papers. Key stakeholders across all relevant lines of business were engaged in the pilot.\n\nThe most relevant findings from the GHG emissions, GDP contribution, living wages, and upstream hotspot analyses comprise:\n\n- GHG emissions: Our analysis enabled us to identify the GHG impact of each subsidiary and location, and we now have insights into which SAP locations have the highest CO2 impacts and which locations have the lowest. Negative impacts of GHG on own operations and supply chain were monetized at more than US$163 million, and this has helped inform decision-making regarding our CO2 reduction strategy. While we are still developing a full downstream impact methodology, we calculated the negative impact of GHG emissions from our existing on-premise installations of our customer base at more than US$1.9 billion. While these impacts were calculated using the VBA’s recommended social cost of carbon valuation coefficient of US$223 per ton of.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nGHG, we realize that there is a wide range of values in the market, and the effort to standardize them further is ongoing.\n\n- GDP contribution: Our overall GDP contribution from our operations and supply chain stands at more than US$8.4 billion (CapEx and OpEx). We have the breakdown of the GDP contribution by all our operating countries. This insight enables us to sharpen our messaging toward public sector companies and governments.\n- Upstream risk analysis: We conducted a complete upstream risk analysis using our procurement spend of 2022. The analysis showed that one of the highest negative monetized impacts was valued at more than US$584 million for the KPI Occupational Health & Safety, and the highest positive monetized impact was valued at US$8.4 billion for the KPI GDP Contribution. Our induced impact calculation showed that we created a total of 110,000 jobs in the supply chain due to our procurement spend and patterns. The real value of monetization of impacts is observable when all our procurement categories and all the KPIs are represented on X and Y axes and the main risk areas are visualized.\n\n# Outlook\n\nAs the impact measurement and valuation ecosystem matures, we will continue to play an active role in its co-development and application and to enable our customers and partners. While we maintain existing partnerships with the VBA and WifOR Institute, we will actively seek other institutional and academic partnerships as well as explore AI capabilities in this topic. We plan to use materiality analyses and material topics as the foundation for developing and applying methodologies to understand, steer, and improve our overall impact. We will increase the frequency of impact valuations to quarterly for selected KPIs. Through our SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises solution and other product lines, we support our customers in their own impact management journeys. As we look ahead, we see the potential for us to place impact management at the center of everything we do and strive to become an impact positive company.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Why Holistic Steering and Reporting Matters section was not subject to an independent limited assurance of our external auditor.\n\n270/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VBA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The VBA is an organization involved in standardization and valuation methodologies for sustainability efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a company that integrates sustainability into its operations and reports on its impact through various methodologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE ACT<|>EVENT<|>A regulatory framework that requires companies to conduct human rights due diligence in their supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATED REPORT 2022<|>EVENT<|>A report published by SAP detailing its sustainability efforts and metrics for the year 2022.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATED REPORT 2023<|>EVENT<|>A report published by SAP detailing its sustainability efforts and metrics for the year 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIVING WAGES<|>EVENT<|>A concept integrated into SAP's annual compensation review process to ensure fair wages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Greenhouse gas emissions measured and analyzed by SAP to assess environmental impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GDP CONTRIBUTION<|>EVENT<|>The economic contribution of SAP's operations and supply chain, valued at more than US$8.4 billion.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VBA<|>SAP<|>SAP collaborates with the VBA to develop methodologies for sustainability and impact measurement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMAN SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE ACT<|>SAP conducts human rights due diligence in compliance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>INTEGRATED REPORT 2022<|>SAP's Integrated Report 2022 includes results and learnings from the VBA's methodologies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>INTEGRATED REPORT 2023<|>SAP's Integrated Report 2023 reflects the company's sustainability efforts and methodologies used in 2023<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>LIVING WAGES<|>SAP integrated the concept of living wages into its compensation review process<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GHG EMISSIONS<|>SAP analyzes GHG emissions to inform its CO2 reduction strategy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GDP CONTRIBUTION<|>SAP reports its GDP contribution as part of its sustainability metrics<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
