And even within a country, the share of carbon-free energy can vary significantly from region to region—meaning that many organizations operate in jurisdictions without easy access to clean energy. And while trade associations such as the Clean Energy Buyers Association, RE-Source, and the Asia Clean Energy Coalition are working to increase access, changes are still needed.\n- Other choices matter too. Information and communications technology (ICT) companies have led the world in adopting renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), with Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google having signed renewable energy agreements totaling almost 50 GW of clean energy generation capacity through 2022, equal to the generation capacity of Sweden. And many tech leaders are going further. Google, for example, has a target to run on carbon-free energy in every grid where it operates by 2030, is already procuring energy from geothermal power plants and battery-based backup power systems, and is piloting the use of AI algorithms to better predict wind production and facilitate its integration into the grid.\n\n# Exhibit 4 - Critical factors determining AI’s emissions footprint\n\n|AI-related energy flow|Power plants|Energy distribution|Data center operations| |Developers|End-user demand for AI-enabled products|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Energy source|Carbon intensity|Data center infrastructure|Model development|&amp; coding|AI adoption|&amp; usage|\n\nSource: BCG analysis.\n\n23 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Data Center Infrastructure\n\nData center energy needs are driven by server and infrastructure choices. Servers specifically designed for machine learning can run AI models faster while using less power. But servers aren’t the only source of energy demand. Additional power is needed to operate the facility—for example, for cooling and lighting. And specific data center equipment choices matter. A study by researchers at Berkeley and Google finds that Google owned, designed, and operated cloud data centers, for example, can be ~1.4–2.0 times more energy efficient than traditional data centers, and hardware specifically designed to support AI and machine learning can be ~2–5X more efficient than off-the-shelf systems. 29 Google’s machine-learning optimized Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are an example: TPU version 4 has proven to be one of the fastest, most efficient, and most sustainable machine learning infrastructure hubs in the world with the potential to generate 93% fewer emissions compared with unoptimized servers using P100 GPUs. 30\n\nHowever, new processors require new manufacturing practices and therefore attention must be paid to their embodied carbon. Future hardware design should look at optimizing full life cycle, instead of just operational, GHG emissions. And relatedly, more effort is needed from the semiconductor industry to understand and reduce embodied emissions.\n\n# Model Development and Coding\n\nState-of-the-art approaches to developing AI models are varied and evolving, but one thing is clear: the desire for more precise and accurate model outputs has been leading to more complex models that rely on larger sets of training data and require more processing power. 31 These more complex models may lead to higher energy consumption, all other factors being equal. Nonetheless, it is important to note that AI model design is an evolving field, and new releases and versions of complex models consistently demonstrate improved energy efficiency while maintaining model performance. Indeed, ongoing improvements in software and algorithmic optimization have the potential to significantly enhance efficiency and decrease computational requirements. One example is the development of evolved sparse models for deep neural networks, which can reduce computations by approximately 5 to 10 times while maintaining the same level of output quality compared with denser baseline models. 32\n\n# Adoption and Usage\n\nAI use is forecast to grow. In an IBM Global survey, 35% of companies reported already using AI in their business in 2021, with an additional 42% stating that they are piloting AI applications for later adoption. 33 Some of the growth in AI adoption might replace existing workloads in today’s data centers, but given the expansion of use cases, aggregate demand will grow. At present, however, there is no recent, peer-reviewed research that forecasts future AI workloads and energy needs.\n\nAny AI model has two phases to its life cycle: training and inference. Training gives the model its smarts and happens sporadically, while inference is the production phase in which the model is used by customers. Inference workloads are therefore driven by customer adoption and usage. And today, inference processing accounts for 80%–90% of AI and machine learning workloads. 34\n\nThese factors are synthesized in Exhibit 5, which makes a critical point: while there is uncertainty on future AI emissions, our decisions matter. We are not suggesting that these are equally important, only making the point that already today there are technology, architecture, and location options that can significantly mitigate AI’s GHG impact.\n\nAnd, beyond these active measures, there are other factors that will influence the speed and scale of AI deployment (for example, the economics of data center development). Data centers can take years to build and require significant capital investment.\n\n# Issue 2: AI’s Water Use\n\nData centers generate insight, but they also generate heat. This heat must be dissipated to protect the servers, communication equipment, and storage devices they contain. For warehouse-scale data centers, water-based cooling is the most common approach. And among water-cooling solutions, evaporative cooling—in which water absorbs ambient heat through evaporation—is frequently both the cheapest and the most energy efficient. Google found that its water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy than its air-cooled data centers. 35 But water cooling has the potential to exacerbate pressure on water resources in specific locations. A Virginia Tech study estimates that one-fifth of US data centers (primarily located in Western states)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLEAN ENERGY BUYERS ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Clean Energy Buyers Association is a trade association working to increase access to clean energy for organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RE-SOURCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RE-Source is a trade association focused on increasing the adoption of renewable energy in various sectors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA CLEAN ENERGY COALITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asia Clean Energy Coalition is a group working to promote clean energy solutions across Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon is a technology company that has signed renewable energy agreements totaling almost 50 GW of clean energy generation capacity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that has committed to renewable energy agreements contributing to clean energy generation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meta is a technology company that has engaged in renewable energy agreements to support clean energy initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a technology company that has signed renewable energy agreements and aims to run on carbon-free energy by 2030.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERKELEY<|>GEO<|>Berkeley is a location where researchers conducted a study on data center energy efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENSOR PROCESSING UNITS<|>EVENT<|>Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialized hardware designed by Google for machine learning, known for their efficiency and sustainability.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAN ENERGY BUYERS ASSOCIATION<|>RE-SOURCE<|>Both organizations are trade associations working towards increasing access to clean energy solutions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAN ENERGY BUYERS ASSOCIATION<|>ASIA CLEAN ENERGY COALITION<|>Both organizations are involved in promoting clean energy initiatives.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RE-SOURCE<|>ASIA CLEAN ENERGY COALITION<|>Both organizations focus on renewable energy adoption and clean energy solutions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON<|>GOOGLE<|>Both companies have signed renewable energy agreements and are leaders in adopting clean energy practices.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>GOOGLE<|>Both companies are technology leaders that have committed to renewable energy agreements and sustainability goals.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META<|>GOOGLE<|>Both companies are involved in renewable energy agreements and are working towards sustainability in their operations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON<|>MICROSOFT<|>Both companies have signed significant renewable energy agreements contributing to clean energy generation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENSOR PROCESSING UNITS<|>GOOGLE<|>Google's TPUs are a key part of their machine learning infrastructure, showcasing their commitment to efficiency and sustainability.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERKELEY<|>GOOGLE<|>Research conducted at Berkeley involved Google and focused on data center energy efficiency, highlighting their collaboration in sustainability efforts.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
