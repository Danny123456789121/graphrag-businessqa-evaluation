Services received increased €579 million to €10,177 million (2022: €9,599 million), mainly due to increased services received in the context of intra-Group cost allocations. The costs for licenses and commissions increased €93 million to €2,006 million (2022: €1,914 million).\n\nSAP SE personnel expenses, mainly the labor cost of software developers, service and support employees, and administration staff employed by SAP SE, increased 17% to €3,386 million (2022: €2,905 million), primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expenses and an increased headcount in the reporting year.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOther operating expenses decreased €104 million to €3,329 million (2022: €3,433 million). This decrease is mainly attributable to a €287 million decrease in currency exchange losses and a €36 million decrease in impairment of receivables. The decrease was partly offset by a €114 million increase in services purchased and by a €179 million increase in other expense, mainly attributable to €155 million in regulatory compliance expenses.\n\nFinance income was €897 million (2022: €1,685 million), representing a year-over-year decrease of €788 million. This decrease is primarily due to a €694 million decrease in net interest income, a €79 million decrease in results from profit and loss transfer agreements, and a €84 million increase in write-downs on financial assets. The decrease was partly offset by a €61 million increase in income from investments.\n\nSAP SE income before taxes increased €2,868 million to €5,292 million (2022: €2,424 million). Income taxes increased €7 million to €504 million (2022: €497 million). After deducting taxes, the resulting net income was €4,766 million (2022: €1,912 million), representing an increase of €2,854 million year over year.\n\n# Assets and Financial Position\n\nIn 2023, SAP SE total assets closed at €47,752 million (2022: €48,996 million).\n\n# SAP SE Balance Sheet as at December 31 − German Commercial Code (Short Version)\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Assets| | |\n|Intangible assets|1,111|1,561|\n|Property, plant, and equipment|1,451|1,393|\n|Financial assets|34,323|37,912|\n|Fixed assets|36,885|40,866|\n|Inventories|1|1|\n|Accounts receivable and other assets|5,712|5,469|\n|Marketable securities and liquid assets|3,778|1,423|\n|Short-term assets|9,491|6,892|\n|Prepaid expenses and deferred charges|774|680|\n|Deferred taxes|602|558|\n|Surplus arising from offsetting|0|0|\n|Total assets|47,752|48,996|\n\n# Equity and liabilities\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Shareholders’ equity|15,945|13,540|\n|Provisions|2,846|2,410|\n|Liabilities|28,951|33,036|\n|Deferred income|10|11|\n|Total shareholders’ equity and liabilities|47,752|48,996|\n\nIntangible assets decreased €450 million year over year to €1,111 million (2022: €1,561 million), mainly due to scheduled depreciations on intangibles.\n\nFinancial assets decreased €3,589 million year over year to €34,323 million (2022: €37,912 million). This was mainly due to the disposal of shares in affiliated companies totaling €5,254 million. Of this, €4,244 million was attributable to the share buyback of SAP America Inc., and €929 million was attributable to the SAP Portals Europe GmbH shares canceled as a result of the merger. Additions to the shares in affiliated companies amounting to €1,782 million had an opposite effect.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n€1,238 million was attributable to the acquisition of LeanIX GmbH, Bonn, Germany, and €493 million was attributable to the shares in SAP Nederland B.V., 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, taken over as part of the merger of SAP Portals Europe GmbH.\n\nThe increase of €243 million in accounts receivable and other assets was primarily the result of a €168 million increase in receivables from affiliated companies and a €77 million increase in other assets.\n\nMarketable securities and liquid assets increased €2,355 million to €3,788 million (2022: €1,423 million).\n\nSAP SE shareholders’ equity increased 18% to €15,945 million (2022: €13,540 million). Against outflows of €2,395 million associated with the payment of the dividend and €960 million for the repurchase of stock in treasury, there was a €4,766 million increase due to net income for 2022 and €995 million from the issuance of treasury stock to serve the share-based payments of employees. The equity ratio (that is, the ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets) is 33% (2022: 28%).\n\nProvisions increased €436 million\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
