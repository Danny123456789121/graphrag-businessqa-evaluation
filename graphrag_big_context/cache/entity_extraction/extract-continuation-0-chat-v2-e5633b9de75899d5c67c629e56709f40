Dependent variable is the dummy variable CSP that is assigned 1 if the firm i is listed at the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA (ISE) in the year t and 0 otherwise. HI5 is the Herfindahl index for voting ownership concentration held by the five main shareholders. OWNC (1- 5) refers to the sum of voting shares (%) held by the main one up to the five main shareholders. ROA is return on assets. GOPP stands for growth opportunities, proxied by Tobin’s q. SIZE (Ln of total assets) proxies for firm size; and refer to 1, 5 and 10% significance levels, respectively firms from environmental risky industries seem to be more eager to undertake social and sustainability actions as can be depicted from their strong presence at the ISE sustainability index. Additional evidence is provided about the adverse effect of high ownership concentration of Brazilian firms on CSP, revealing that large controlling shareholders are not so concerned with ESG issues. Perhaps, the great proportion of corporate governance and economic dimensions of the ISE index may be driving this result taking into account that previous literature has found important negative effect of ownership concentration over corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Branda˜ o and Crisostomo, 2015). Worth noting is the new evidence provided that more large blockholders seem to be able to reduce this negative influence of high ownership concentration over CSP which may signal the existence of an initial contest power in this specific firm policy. It is important to note the relevance of firm size and growth opportunities in improving CSP, and that the\n\nmacroeconomic conditions during the international financial crisis (2007-2009) had adverse effect on Brazilian firms’ CSP. Table VIII summarizes all results found trying to leave it clearer.\n\n# 5. Conclusions\n\nThe increasing relevance of CSP, which comprises ESG concerns, on business practices, has motivated research about its drivers. In this context, this work analyzes CSP determinants in an important emerging market, Brazil. CSP is proxied by the firm’s annual membership to the Brazilian ISE. Firm’s presence in the ISE index is conditioned on a tough competition among firms that fulfill a specific questionnaire comprising seven dimensions of corporate, social and sustainability concerns. A new large panel data set of Brazilian firms for the period of 2006-2015 was built, containing 2,685 firm-year observations with at least four years of observations for each firm.\n\nLiterature has suggested a set of firm attributes as able to affect firm CSP, as for example, firm size, firm performance, industry environmental sensitivity and ownership structure. This work provides evidence that firms from environmental risky industries are found to be leading CSP firms given that they have higher probability to be present in the Brazilian ISE. This reality shows that indeed firm’s industry environmental sensitivity is relevant to CSP. This may be a consequence of stakeholders’ pressure and institutional advances achieved in Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment which may be leading to positive enforcement results. It is important to highlight the negative effect of macroeconomic conditions during the financial crisis (2007-2009) on Brazilian firm CSP and that in the aftermath when such adverse situation seems to have faced a reversion.\n\nUnder the agency theoretical framework, high firm ownership concentration is proposed as able to align the principal and agent interests, at the same time that may favor the interests of controlling shareholders who become powerful enough to influence important firm policies, including social and sustainability responsibilities. The excess power of large\n\n**Table VIII Summary of results**\n|Hypothesis|Finding|\n|---|---|\n|H1: Ownership concentration has an adverse effect on the probability of the firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index which signals firm CSP|Supported (negative effect found)|\n|H2: Firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index|Supported (positive effect found)|\n|H3: Profitability has a positive effect on CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index|Not supported (no effect found)|\n|H4: Larger firms are more likely to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index|Supported (positive effect found)|\n|H5: Growth opportunities have a positive influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|>GEO<|>Brazil is an emerging market where the analysis of Corporate Sustainability Practices (CSP) is conducted, particularly focusing on firms' membership to the ISE sustainability index.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA (ISE) is a benchmark for sustainability practices among Brazilian firms, assessing their corporate, social, and sustainability concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2007-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS<|>EVENT<|>The international financial crisis that occurred from 2007 to 2009 had adverse effects on Brazilian firms' Corporate Sustainability Practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Firms in Brazil are analyzed for their Corporate Sustainability Practices, particularly those in environmentally risky industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate governance refers to the systems and processes that direct and control firms, which are influenced by ownership concentration and stakeholder pressures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ownership concentration refers to the distribution of ownership among shareholders, which can affect firm policies, including sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAZIL<|>ISE<|>Brazilian firms' membership to the ISE sustainability index is a key indicator of their Corporate Sustainability Practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2007-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS<|>FIRMS<|>The financial crisis negatively impacted the Corporate Sustainability Practices of Brazilian firms<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRMS<|>OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION<|>Ownership concentration influences the policies of Brazilian firms, including their approach to Corporate Sustainability Practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<|>OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION<|>Corporate governance is affected by ownership concentration, which can lead to different sustainability outcomes for firms<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRMS<|>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<|>The governance structures of Brazilian firms impact their Corporate Sustainability Practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRMS<|>2007-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS<|>Firms' responses to the financial crisis are linked to their Corporate Sustainability Practices<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
