It advised the Executive Board on an ongoing basis with regard to the running of the Company and it scrutinized and monitored the work of management. The Supervisory Board received regular, full, and timely reports from the Executive Board, both from members in person and in written documents. The Supervisory Board was also in regular exchange with senior internal officers through its various committees. This ensured that we were always up to date, even between meetings, on the Company’s strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk management, compliance (in other words, adherence to laws, to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, and to internal policies), and on transactions of special significance for SAP. In its reports, the Executive Board also informed us in particular where business deviated from plan or target, and why. We questioned and probed the Executive Board’s reports to satisfy ourselves that the information it gave us was plausible. The Executive Board fully met our requirements when it came to providing information.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board chairperson and the CEO were in continuous contact, which meant the Supervisory Board chairperson was always apprised without delay of all important events that were significant for assessing SAP’s situation and progress or for the management and governance of the Company. Moreover, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the CEO regularly discussed matters related to SAP’s strategy, business performance, risk position, risk management, and compliance. In preparation for the upcoming handover of the Supervisory Board chair position, the deputy chairperson representing the shareholder representatives was increasingly included in these discussions.\n\nTransactions that were submitted to us because they required the approval of the Supervisory Board whether by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or the Supervisory Board’s list of transactions requiring its consent, were approved by us after detailed examination and discussion with the Executive Board.\n\n# Supervisory Board Meetings and Resolutions\n\nIn the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE held four ordinary meetings and three extraordinary meetings at which we deliberated and resolved on all matters of relevance to the Company. Our plenary meetings and committee meetings were held as physical meetings, as video or telephone conferences, or as hybrid sessions, where some members attended physically and the remainder online. We also adopted 15 resolutions by correspondence vote. The following table provides an overview of the individual members’ attendance at the Supervisory Board’s plenary sessions and committee meetings in the year under review. This report also contains a table that shows which meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees were held as a physical meeting, as a video or telephone conference, or as a hybrid session.\n\n|Meeting Type|Attendance|\n|---|---|\n|Ordinary Meetings|4|\n|Extraordinary Meetings|3|\n|Resolutions by Correspondence Vote|15|\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Meeting Participation of SAP Supervisory Board Members During Fiscal Year 2023\n\n|Supervisory Board Members|Plenum Meetings|Participation|Committees Meetings|Participation|All Meetings|Participation|Participation in %|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Prof. Dr. h. c.
