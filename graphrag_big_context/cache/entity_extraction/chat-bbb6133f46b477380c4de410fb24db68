Our expense base in 2023 was impacted by our transformation to a fast-growing cloud business. The cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) for 2023 was 72.6%, increasing 2.2pp at constant currencies year over year. Our cloud margin benefitted from an increase in cloud revenue and significantly lower investments in the Next-Generation Cloud Delivery initiative (modernization of our cloud delivery to enable a more resilient and scalable cloud infrastructure).\n\nOur overall headcount increased by 1,291 full-time equivalents, or FTEs (732 thereof organically), primarily in the functional areas Research and Development and Cloud. Non-IFRS operating profit in 2023 was €9.04 billion on a constant currency basis (2022: €7.67 billion), reflecting an increase of 13%. Operating profit and margin benefitted from accelerated growth in revenue, completion of the Next Generation Cloud Delivery initiative, and strict cost management. Thus, non-IFRS operating profit came in above the target range (€8.65 billion to €8.95 billion).\n\nWe achieved an effective tax rate (IFRS) of 32.6% and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 29.3%, which is above the outlook of 28.0% to 32.0% (IFRS) and 26.0% to 28.0% (non-IFRS). This mainly resulted from changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\n# Operating Results (IFRS)\n\nThis section on operating results (IFRS) discusses results only in terms of IFRS measures, so the IFRS numbers are not expressly identified as such. We break our operations down into three regions: the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, the Americas region, and the Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) region. We allocate revenue amounts to each region based on where the customer is located. For more information about revenue by geographic region, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (A.1).\n\n# Revenue\n\n|Total Revenue1|€ millions | change since previous year|\n|---|---|\n|2019|€27,553|\n|2020|€27,338|\n|2021|€26,953|\n|2022|€29,520|\n|2023|€31,207|\n\n1 The numbers for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect continuing operations as a result of the divestiture of Qualtrics.\n\nTotal revenue increased from €29,520 million in 2022 to €31,207 million in 2023, representing an increase of €1,688 million, or 6%.

Service revenue increased 4% from €4,128 million in 2022 to €4,283 million in 2023, which was 14% of total revenue (2022: 14%).\n\n70/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Revenue by Revenue Type\n\n|Type|€ millions|\n|---|---|\n|Cloud|13,664|\n|Software licenses|1,764|\n|Software support|11,496|\n|Services|4,283|\n\nFor more information about our regional performance, see the Revenue by Region section. Cloud revenue refers to the income earned from contracts that permit the customer during the term of its contract with SAP to access specific software solutions hosted by SAP or third parties engaged by SAP. Software licenses revenue results from the fees earned from selling or licensing software to customers. Support revenue represents fees earned from providing customers with technical support services and unspecified software upgrades, updates, and enhancements.
