By increasing the programmed outside temperature set point that determines when the sumps are filled with water, we were able to improve our water usage efficiency (WUE).\n- Based on our water risk-assessment for our ISO 14001-certified sites: twenty percent of these sites are located in high to extremely high water-risk regions. In 2023, we enabled access to real consumption data in these sites by installing water (sub)meters and/or sensors to measure and improve our consumption.\n- At our headquarters and other locations, we use rain and run-off water for irrigation and toilets.\n- In Bangalore (India), a rainwater harvesting system was installed to improve water conservation and a system to capture atmospheric particles was implemented to produce water for the cafeteria.\n- In Budapest (Hungary) and Bangalore (India), we installed water aerators that reduce the water usage by 40%.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Waste and Water section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor.\n\nBased on the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas of the World Resource Institute.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Public Policy\n\nSAP has developed trusting and transparent relationships with governments worldwide by cooperatively exploring the potential for information and communications technologies to spur economic growth, create jobs, and address societal challenges. This includes consideration of the role governments play as users as well as policy makers, and by supporting the digital transformation of the public sector to become more efficient, effective, and citizen-oriented.\n\nSAP engages with governments around the globe on various policy issues and on creating reasonable framework conditions for the adoption of new beneficial technologies or business models such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and Big Data.\n\nSAP believes in transparency in the political process. Accordingly, we are registered in the Lobby Registry of the German Federal Parliament and selected state parliaments and in the European Transparency Register for interest representatives. In the United States, SAP is registered, and reports in compliance with, the federal Lobbying Disclosure Act. We are also registered in other countries, wherever required by local law.\n\n# Political Contributions\n\nIn accordance with the SAP Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, SAP does not make direct contributions for political purposes, to political parties, politicians, or political organizations other than through event sponsorships and related marketing as allowed by law and specifically approved by SAP Global Government Affairs and the Office of Ethics & Compliance (OEC). By the laws of the United States, SAP employees exercise their right to operate a political action committee (PAC). The SAP America PAC is an independent, registered, and strictly regulated organization that allows eligible SAP employees to voluntarily contribute to the SAP America PAC in the United States to financially support candidates seeking public office at the state and federal levels. Consistent with U.S. laws, SAP exercises no control over or influence on the SAP America PAC. SAP America PAC expenditure figures are transparent and accessible through the U.S. Federal Election Commission Web site.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Public Policy section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor.\n\n279/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Memberships, Partnerships, and Commitments\n\nTo better understand and evolve sustainable performance, dialog, and exchange of knowledge and different perspectives on a national, regional, and global level, are vital for SAP, both for our company and customers.
