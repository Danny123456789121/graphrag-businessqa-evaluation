During the search for alternative responses, the activation of different response patterns increases the “likelihood of finding multiple [yet competing] responses that match the issue” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). This brings together response repertoires that are usually applied separately—for instance, working with peripheral stakeholders, such as social activists (Hart & Sharma, 2004), while defending established business practices. While decision makers with a paradoxical frame perceive a greater novelty of the responses they consider, their tendency to see sustainability issues as unique problems also heightens the perceived riskiness of their responses (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Managers with a paradoxical frame do not underestimate the riskiness of potential responses because they lack established routines and have only a moderate sense of control. Rather, they accept that there is some uncontrollable risk. To handle risk they avoid taking a stand on the issue too early and keep their options open (Das & Teng, 1999). Thus, while decision makers with a paradoxical frame see the need to consider novel and unusual responses that go beyond existing routines, they are aware of the risk that is associated with such responses. In particular, they are aware that addressing sustainability issues comprehensively entails conflict and undesired side effects. As research in environmental psychology has shown, this awareness of ambivalent effects of more comprehensive responses to sustainability issues lowers the propensity to take concrete action (Castro et al., 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004).\n\nRecent debates on sustainability issues in agribusiness—food security, biodiversity loss, and genetically modified seeds—illustrate the impact of ambivalence on the types of response decision makers consider. For example, Unilever’s sustainability manager recently conveyed an ambivalent position on organic agriculture by emphasizing a reluctance to go fully organic because this would jeopardize food production on the usual scale (NRC, 2013). Yet at the same time Unilever’s upper management pioneered novel sustainable agriculture practices (Whiteman et al., 2013). These have resulted in innovative practices for sustainable agriculture but have had limited business impact, since “it was difficult (at the time) to translate the treatments involving extreme reductions in fertilizers and pesticides into marketable stories” (Pretty et al., 2008: 57–58). Ambivalence on the part of Unilever’s management regarding organic farming led to innovative solutions going beyond using established routines, but these innovations were used on a small scale only.\n\nOverall, we expect that holding a paradoxical frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by prudence. On the one hand, with their comprehensive view on sustainability issues, these managers will see the need to consider responses that break with established routines and business practices in order to achieve environmental and social benefits at the societal level. On the other hand, they will be aware of “the massive uncertainty and unpredictability, nonlinear interaction between system components, unknown thresholds, and complex dynamics in ecological and social systems” (Gladwin et al., 1995: 879) and, hence, tend to approach sustainability issues by moving slowly and carefully (Das & Teng, 1999). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame might even perceive sustainability issues as overly problematic, which would prevent them from envisaging workable solutions and assuming responsibilities for their practical implementation (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).\n\n# Proposition 7b\n\nThe more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a prudent stance on sustainability issues.\n\n# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nOur main objective in this article is to develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We advance theoretical understanding of the stance managers take on sustainability issues by proposing how two ideal-type cognitive frames, with their differences in content and structure, affect the stages of the sensemaking process of ambiguous issues. In previous research scholars have underlined the importance of managerial cognition and sensemaking of sustainability (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Byrch et al., 2007; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999); we add to this literature by offering a more fine-grained understanding of the role individual cognition plays in managerial decision making on corporate sustainability. By address-\n\n2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 479\n\ning a wider variety of alternative cognitive frames, we advance research in corporate sustainability, which so far has almost exclusively relied on business case thinking (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2010).\n\nAs our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making on sustainability issues. Building on previous work on the role of interpretation of sustainability issues in explaining strategic choice (Sharma, 2000), we uncover the effects of differences in cognitive frames on the underlying sensemaking process that links cognition with a manager’s decision-making stance. This cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability connects to a number of key aspects of the debate on managerial interpretations of and responses to sustainability issues. For instance, while the strategic management literature has recently drawn attention to the role of ambivalent issue interpretations (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010), the corresponding debate in the sustainability literature has remained within an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000). We advance this field of research not only by introducing ambivalent managerial interpretations of sustainability issues but also by elaborating on the cognitive determinants of univalent and ambivalent interpretations. In previous research on the antecedents of managers’ ambivalent interpretation of strategic issues, scholars have focused on organizational factors (Plambeck & Weber,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNILEVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unilever is a multinational company known for its consumer goods, which has engaged in discussions about sustainability and organic agriculture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability refers to the ability to maintain ecological and social systems in a balanced manner, often discussed in the context of corporate responsibility and environmental impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRIBUSINESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agribusiness encompasses the businesses involved in the production, processing, and distribution of agricultural products, often facing sustainability challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD SECURITY<|>EVENT<|>Food security is the state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food, a key issue in sustainability discussions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIODIVERSITY LOSS<|>EVENT<|>Biodiversity loss refers to the decline in the variety of life on Earth, which is a significant concern in sustainability and environmental management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Genetically modified seeds are seeds that have been altered using genetic engineering techniques, often debated in the context of sustainability and food production.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNILEVER<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Unilever's management has expressed ambivalence regarding sustainability practices, particularly in relation to organic agriculture<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRIBUSINESS<|>FOOD SECURITY<|>Agribusiness plays a crucial role in addressing food security challenges through sustainable practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRIBUSINESS<|>BIODIVERSITY LOSS<|>Agribusiness practices can significantly impact biodiversity, leading to discussions on sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRIBUSINESS<|>GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS<|>The use of genetically modified seeds in agribusiness is a contentious issue related to sustainability practices<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>FOOD SECURITY<|>Sustainability efforts are essential for ensuring long-term food security<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>BIODIVERSITY LOSS<|>Addressing sustainability issues is critical to preventing biodiversity loss<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS<|>Sustainability discussions often include the implications of using genetically modified seeds<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
