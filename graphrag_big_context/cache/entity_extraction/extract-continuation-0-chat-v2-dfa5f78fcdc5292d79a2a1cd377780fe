The program is designed to give employees a further point of contact in the business when compliance matters arise. Ambassadors participate in an extensive curriculum of monthly on-boarding sessions over a 15-month period. They are invited to cascade and transfer information on the importance of compliance and ethics throughout their teams and lines of business. In 2023, the Extended Compliance Ambassador Network was launched, giving compliance ambassadors who have completed the ambassador curriculum an opportunity to meet on a quarterly basis.\n\n# Training Offerings\n\nOur training programs cover topics such as anticorruption and antibribery, conflicts of interest, governance for customer commitments, working with public sector customers, and compliant partner engagement. In addition to our biannual Ethical Fundamentals online training course for all SAP employees, a new Ethical Success workshop was delivered live for all Sales and Presales employees in the Customer Success Board area. We continue to train new hires globally and we continue to hold Ethical Leadership workshops for new people managers. Additionally, our field compliance officers hold live trainings, in person and virtually, according to a risk-based approach for the specific teams and countries they support. These trainings target employees.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nacross the organization, from customer-facing staff to individuals in supporting roles, such as finance, marketing, and legal.\n\n# Compliance Processes\n\nThe OEC also evaluates SAP’s third-party providers to assess whether SAP’s compliance standards are met. New suppliers and third parties seeking a partnership with SAP are scrutinized according to a risk-based compliance due diligence process, which is repeated every two to five years thereafter. Supplier and partner relationships are formally defined in contracts that outline their obligation to abide by SAP’s compliance requirements. In almost all cases, these include a “right to audit” clause. The OEC also has a team dedicated to conducting compliance audits of partners and suppliers to assess adherence to SAP’s requirements and to identify and address compliance risks.\n\nThe OEC’s Compliance Monitoring & Analysis (CMA) team monitors the effectiveness of SAP’s compliance processes and controls through regular testing of high-risk transactions, identified using a data analytics tool developed with PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH (PwC) and through manual sampling. The CMA team also analyzes findings from investigations and partner audit reports to identify potential enterprise-wide process deficiencies and patterns that indicate a compliance risk. The team then conducts root cause analyses on the highest-risk topics and recommends remediation actions to mitigate the risks.\n\n# Speak Out at SAP\n\nSpeak Out at SAP is SAP’s independently managed whistleblower reporting tool, through which any matters or concerns can be reported easily, and, if desired, anonymously. The tool is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, both internally to SAP employees and externally to concerned parties, including customers, suppliers, and partners.\n\nReports may be submitted either directly by the reporter through the Internet-based portal, or by phone, with local language support across the globe in order to maximize accessibility for reporters. In all cases, SAP continues to maintain a strict non-retaliation policy.\n\nBeyond Speak Out at SAP, we provide further reporting channels, including an internal ticketing system, a postal address for written submissions, and local contact persons worldwide.\n\n# Investigating Misconduct\n\nThe OEC’s investigation team is comprised of dedicated investigators who probe allegations of misconduct within the OEC’s area of responsibility. In recent years, the team has engaged the assistance of an external law firm to examine whistleblower complaints alleging that the business conduct of some former SAP employees within subsidiary SAP companies did not comply with SAP’s policies and procedures or applicable laws. These investigations culminated in January 2024 in a settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), as well as with local authorities in South Africa. SAP fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities, and took immediate steps to discipline the employees involved, including terminating all those implicated in potential law violations. Since these allegations were made, SAP has also significantly strengthened its compliance program and related internal controls in accordance with DOJ and regulatory expectations and requirements.\n\nFor more information about the material allegations currently being investigated by the OEC, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.3).\n\n# Related Risks for SAP\n\nThe actions and processes to address risks in business conduct are described above. For more information about financial risks, see also Ethical Behavior in the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Business Conduct section was not subject to the statutory audit of the combined management report. However, our external auditor performed an independent limited assurance engagement for the content of this section.\n\n121/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Human Rights\n\n# Vision and Strategy\n\nSAP is committed to respecting and advancing human rights across our operations, extended supply chain, and product lifecycle, and we are guided by the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in doing so. We also expect our employees and business partners to respect human rights and avoid complicity in any abuse.\n\n# Due Diligence\n\n# Governance\n\nOur cross-company agenda on human rights is driven by SAP’s Human Rights Office that is part of the chief sustainability officer’s organization.
