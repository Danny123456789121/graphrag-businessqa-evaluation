Where generative AI and foundation models are assumed to increase revenue, we recast the effect as an increase in productivity that would be the equivalent of the reduced level of spending required to maintain the same level of output (thus enabling comparability with cost reductions). Our analysis of use cases only examines the direct impact of generative AI on productivity. They do not incorporate secondary benefits, such as the economic impact of hiring a more capable employee or hiring employees more rapidly.\n\n# Estimate the impact across industries\n\nTo estimate the impact of generative AI and foundation models across industries, we scaled our analysis from a functional lens to an industry lens for each industry, assessing the weight of functional costs. For instance, customer operations costs are higher in the telecom industry than in aerospace. For each use case, the relevant costs were defined to account only for activities for which generative AI or foundation models were likely to deliver productivity gains. For example, the cost base against which we assessed productivity gains for the marketing function excludes ad buying costs because the use cases we assessed for generative AI in that function would have no productivity impact on the “ad buying” activity.\n\n# A.\n\nGlobal revenues for each industry in 2022 were sourced from IHS Markit and Oxford Economics.\n\n# B.\n\nWe estimated the functional cost for a function as a percentage of total revenue in an industry based on published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.\n\nGenerative AI at work, April 2023.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nC. For each function, we estimated the relevant costs (considering only underlying activities affected by our use cases) as a portion of overall spending on a function, again informed by published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.\n\nD. For each use case, we quantified the potential impact of generative AI and foundation models based on the impact (either cost or revenue) as a function of the relevant addressable spending.\n\nE. We then calculated the impact by industry by aggregating the technology’s impact on use cases in an industry across functions.\n\n# Limitations of our impact analysis\n\nFor each use case, our analysis of the impact of generative AI and foundation models draws a conservative base case and a more accelerated upside potential. The estimates are based on existing data and experiences, and these estimates could be updated over time. Additionally, the list of use cases is not exhaustive but is as comprehensive as possible, given our methods.\n\nThe estimates in this report should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the nature of the technology and the wide range of uncertainty involved in the future development of generative AI. We welcome challenges to our analysis as well as additional inputs that would refine and enhance it.\n\n# Comparison with the 2018 report\n\n# Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning\n\nTo estimate the incremental impact that generative AI and foundation models could have in comparison to the value of artificial intelligence overall, we updated our 2018 estimates of the value that could be created through deployment of advanced analytics and previous generations of artificial intelligence.3 This research incorporates 2022 updates to baseline financial variables such as industry revenues, enabling updates to the total potential economic impact of advanced analytics and AI exclusive of generative AI and foundation models.\n\n# III. How we estimated the impact of generative AI on the potential for technical automation\n\nThis report continues and adapts the methodology and findings of the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, *A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity.*4 We recommend that readers refer to the technical appendix of that report for our full methodology. Here, we outline updates we have incorporated in the automation adoption estimation process and a brief overview of the steps involved in assessing automation adoption, together with methodology to estimate the impact of automation on work hours (represented as full-time equivalents, or FTEs, where one FTE equals 2,080 hours) and GDP impact.
