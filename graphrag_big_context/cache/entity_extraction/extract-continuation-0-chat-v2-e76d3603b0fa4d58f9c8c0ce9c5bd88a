An LTI tranche was granted annually and had a term of four years (2016–2019 tranches).\n\nAll share units granted in this way, comprising 60% PSUs and 40% Retention Share Units, had a vesting period of approximately four years. At the end of the vesting period, the corresponding share units were non-forfeitable. The payout price used for the settlement was the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices of the SAP share on the 20 trading days following the publication of SAP’s fourth-quarter results subsequent to the end of the vesting period. The payout price was capped at 300% of the grant price. The number of PSUs ultimately paid out was dependent on the performance of the SAP share – absolute and relative to the Peer Group Index. The LTI tranche was cash-settled and paid in euros after the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting of the corresponding year. The last LTI tranche 2019 was paid out in 2023.\n\n# The valuation was based on the following parameters and assumptions:\n\n# Fair Value and Parameters Used at Year End 2023\n\n|€, unless otherwise stated|LTI 2020 (2020–2023 Tranches)|Move (2020–2023 Tranches)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Weighted average fair value as at 12/31/2023|154.24|137.98|\n|Information how fair value was measured at measurement date| | |\n|Valuation model used|Monte Carlo|Other3|\n|Share price|139.48|139.48|\n|Expected volatility (in %)|15 to 23|NA|\n|Expected dividend yield (in %)|NA|1.52|\n|Weighted average remaining life of awards outstanding as at 12/31/2023 (in years)|1.9|0.7|\n\n# Fair Value and Parameters Used at Year End 2022\n\n|€, unless otherwise stated|LTI 2020 (2020–2022 Tranches)|Move (2019–2022 Tranches)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Weighted average fair value as at 12/31/2022|94.83|94.78|\n|Information how fair value was measured at measurement date| | |\n|Valuation model used|Monte Carlo|Other3|\n|Share price|96.39|96.39|\n|Expected volatility (in %)|24 to 31|NA|\n|Expected dividend yield (in %)|NA|2.03|\n|Weighted average remaining life of awards outstanding as at 12/31/2022 (in years)|2.3|0.8|\n\n3 For these awards, the fair value is calculated by subtracting expected future dividends, if any, until maturity of the respective award from the prevailing share price as at the measurement date.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nFor the LTI 2020 valuation, the NASDAQ-100 Total Return Index on December 31, 2023, was US$20,158.42 (2022: US$12,994.57).
