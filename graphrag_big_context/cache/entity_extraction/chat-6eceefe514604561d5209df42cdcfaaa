The rest of the chapter provides examples of how policymakers—as well as business and social-sector leaders—have already taken steps to contribute to these outcomes. While policy priorities must be tailored to the specific circumstances and capabilities of each country and region, we believe all leaders should adopt clear AI principles to ensure the responsible development and application of the technology.\n\nWe expand on the thinking in the remainder of the chapter, and hope our framing provides inspiration and a starting point.\n\n# Enable AI for Climate\n\nIf we are to be successful in maximizing AI’s contribution to climate action, one critical area for policy focus is on the supply side, ensuring that AI’s critical inputs—high-quality data, technology infrastructure, and talent—are available wherever needed. We discuss each in turn.\n\n# Encourage Data Collection and Sharing\n\nAI impact starts with good data. Without it, algorithms cannot generate accurate and effective insights or recommendations. Actionable wildfire alerts, for example, cannot be developed without access to high-quality, real-time satellite data—and good agricultural advice is impossible if data is available only for a limited number of crops or geographies. Moreover, to yield useful insights, many AI applications for climate will need to tap into multiple data sources. London Transport, for example, leverages data on emissions sources, road traffic, air quality, and population density to monitor air pollution challenges and identify highly exposed locations. Making the data available is not enough; it also needs to be accessible in standard formats that allow data from different sources to be merged safely and efficiently.\n\nIt is therefore essential that policymakers take steps to make data accessible—at a minimum in the climate sphere, given the urgent need for rapid and effective action to reduce emissions and build resilience globally—while also protecting trade secrets and intellectual property.\n\n# Exhibit 6 - AI for Climate: A summary of critical policy outcomes\n\n|Policy outcomes|Enable AI for climate|Deploy AI for climate|Guide AI for climate|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Ensure the availability of data, technology infrastructure, and talent|Drive AI solutions for climate in public sector—and catalyze private sector action|Promote environmentally and socially responsible use of AI| |\n| |Encourage data collection and sharing|Define and deliver on public sector priorities|Shape and execute AI for climate strategies and demonstration cases|\n| |Address environmental impacts of AI operations|Enhance transparency and streamline the adoption of sustainable AI practices| |\n|Ensure technology access and affordability| |Encourage private sector adoption|Create incentives to accelerate use of AI for climate|\n| |Cultivate awareness and build expertise|Invest in knowledge and talent to drive AI for climate solutions|Promote socially responsible use of AI for climate|\n| |Encourage fairness, inclusiveness, safety, and data privacy| | |\n\nSource: BCG analysis.\n\n29 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Leaders could:\n\nEncourage collection and sharing of climate-related data and tools across public and private organizations.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- The UK Climate Change Statistics Portal gives open access to climate-related data and statistics (weather, emissions of GHG, status of surface water, renewable energy share, etc.). This data is compiled from various government departments, agencies, and public bodies.\n- The US Climate Resilience Toolkit, developed by a collaboration of multiple federal agencies and organizations led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, provides essential climate information, projections, and tools to help organizations enhance their resilience to climate-related challenges.\n- Sign Smart, also known as the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory System, is an application system developed by the Indonesian government. Its objective is to provide valid, accurate, and up-to-date data and information about GHG emissions, while also enhancing the effectiveness of data processing and GHG estimation at the national, provincial, and district/city levels.\n- Data Commons is an initiative led by Google designed to centralize and streamline publicly available data from diverse sources. It provides a wide range of climate and sustainability-related data, covering areas such as emissions, natural disasters, and waste. Accessing this data is made simple through an interface that supports natural language searches. The AI-driven query function retrieves results directly from Data Commons, providing links to the original sources of information and data.\n\n# Define standard processes and protocols for climate-relevant data gathering and sharing to ensure data is robust, trustworthy, safe, and respectful of privacy.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- The European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) aims to deliver a consistent, satellite-derived data set of Essential Climate Variables (for example, greenhouse gases, sea level, glacier status, etc.) to aid climate modelers and researchers over the long term. To guarantee consistency among the various projects within the program, it has released data standards outlining the minimal requirements for climate data producers.\n- The World Meteorological Organization has published the Technical Regulations, an international framework for data standardization and interoperability in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, climatology, and related environmental disciplines. These standards enable the continuous operation of global systems, ensuring 24/7 observations, data exchange, management, forecasting, and the delivery of authoritative scientific assessments and standardized services.\n\n# Create data catalogs across priority sectors for all climate-relevant data categories (for example, weather, water, agriculture, energy use, and socioeconomic factors).\n\n# Examples:\n\n- The World Meteorological Organization has not only published a set of data standards but also a Catalogue for Climate Data, a curated\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
