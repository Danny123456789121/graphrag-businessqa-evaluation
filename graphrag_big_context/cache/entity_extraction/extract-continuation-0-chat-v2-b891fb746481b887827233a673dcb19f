In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the combined group management report listed in section “OTHER INFORMATION”.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as well as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the group as at December 31, 2023 and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and\n- the accompanying combined group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group’s position. In all material respects, this combined group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined group management report does not cover the content of those parts of the combined group management report listed in section “OTHER INFORMATION”.\n\nPursuant to § 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB (German Commercial Code), we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group management report.\n\n# BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the “AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\ncommercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) letter (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined group management report.\n\n# KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. We have identified the following matters as key audit matters to be disclosed in our auditor’s report:\n\n1. Cloud revenue recognition\n2. Assessment of the Group’s uncertain tax treatments\n3. Measurement of unlisted equity securities\n\n# CLOUD REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\n# Matter\n\nThe Group generated revenue in 2023 of EUR 31,207 million, of which EUR 13,664 million relate to cloud revenues from fees earned from providing customers a cloud offering with software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service and/or premium cloud support through subscriptions for use of the Group’s cloud solutions. For most of the Group’s cloud offerings, measured both in volume and number, the customer is entitled to continuously access and use one or more cloud solutions for a specified term, therefore cloud revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the term of access. However, some cloud business models are provisioned on a consumption basis where a customer commits to a fixed value of spend on cloud services throughout the contract term, but with the discretion to call off cloud services on an as needed basis. For those arrangements cloud revenue is recognized based on consumption as it best reflects the measure towards satisfaction of the performance obligation(s).\n\nThe evaluation of cloud revenue contracts bears an inherent risk of errors due to the complex nature of certain contracts. SAP defined detailed accounting policy guidelines in line with the applicable accounting standards and has established uniform processes throughout the group to manage the accounting for its cloud contracts. Applying them often requires significant management judgement, in particular with respect to whether certain agreements with the same customer are economically linked and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP SE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP SE is a multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, known for its cloud offerings and financial reporting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>GEO<|>The European Union is a political and economic union of member states located primarily in Europe, which has regulations affecting financial reporting and auditing standards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is a country in Central Europe, known for its legal requirements regarding financial statements and auditing practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUT DER WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer is the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany, which sets standards for financial statement audits in Germany.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Accounting Standards Board is an independent organization that develops and approves International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUDIT OPINION<|>EVENT<|>The audit opinion is a formal statement issued by auditors regarding the accuracy and fairness of a company's financial statements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL YEAR 2023<|>EVENT<|>The financial year 2023 refers to the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, during which SAP SE's financial performance is reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD REVENUE RECOGNITION<|>EVENT<|>Cloud revenue recognition is the accounting process for recognizing revenue from cloud services provided by SAP SE, which involves complex contract evaluations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>EU<|>SAP SE operates under the regulations set by the EU, which affect its financial reporting and auditing standards<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>GERMANY<|>SAP SE is subject to German legal requirements for financial statements and auditing practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>INSTITUT DER WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFER<|>SAP SE follows the auditing standards set by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Germany<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP SE<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>SAP SE complies with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in its financial reporting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL YEAR 2023<|>SAP SE<|>The financial year 2023 is the period for which SAP SE's financial performance is reported<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD REVENUE RECOGNITION<|>SAP SE<|>Cloud revenue recognition is a key aspect of SAP SE's financial reporting, reflecting its revenue from cloud services<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
