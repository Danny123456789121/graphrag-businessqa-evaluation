Since management at levels below the Executive Board does not influence these expenses, we generally do not consider these expenses for the purpose of evaluating the performance of management units. For similar reasons, until 2023 we excluded share-based payment expenses, as these costs are impacted by share price developments and other factors beyond our control. We also exclude restructuring expenses because they are volatile and generally cannot be influenced by management at levels below the Executive Board. We exclude expenses related to regulatory compliance matters, as these expenses are non-recurring and relate to conduct that took place in prior performance periods, and so that users of our consolidated financial statements and the combined management report can see the information that our management uses to manage the business.\n\nIn recent years, SAP has replaced many of its cash-settled share-based compensation plans with equity-settled plans. Having most of these plans as equity-settled reduces the impact of share price fluctuations and of other factors outside of our control. For these reasons, SAP has decided that, from 2024, it will no longer exclude share-based payment expenses from its operating profit (non-IFRS).\n\n# Financial Income, Net (Non-IFRS)\n\nStarting in 2024, numbers that are identified as financial income, net (non-IFRS) will be adjusted by excluding the following gains and losses:\n\n- Gains and losses from equity securities, net\n- Includes realized and unrealized effects from the disposal of equity securities, ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity investments, changes in fair value of non-marketable equity securities, and others.\n\nExcluding gains and losses from equity securities, net, improves the period-over-period comparability, because there is less volatility caused by share price fluctuation, market developments, and other factors beyond our control.\n\n# Constant Currencies Information\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to have information that provides insight into the development of our sales. Revenue measures determined under IFRS provide information that is useful in this regard. However, both sales volume and currency effects impact period-over-period changes in sales revenue. We do not sell standardized units of products and services so we cannot provide relevant information on sales volume by providing data on the changes in product and service units sold. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors in breaking down and evaluating changes in sales volume, we present information about our revenue and various values and components relating to operating profit that are adjusted for foreign currency effects. We calculate constant currency measures by translating foreign currencies using the average exchange rates from the comparative period instead of the current period. Constant currency measures on CCB use the closing exchange rate from the previous yearâ€™s corresponding key date instead of the average exchange rate.\n\n# Free Cash Flow\n\nAmong other measures, we use free cash flow to manage our overall financial performance. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities minus purchases of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, and payments of lease liabilities.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Reconciliation of Operating Cash Flow from Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow\n\n|â‚¬ millions|2023|2022|âˆ† in %|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Net cash flows from operating activities â€“ continuing operations|6,210|5,675|9|\n|Purchase of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment|â€“785|â€“877|â€“11|\n|Payments of lease liabilities|â€“332|â€“410|â€“19|\n|Free cash flow|5,093|4,388|16|\n\n# Usefulness of Non-IFRS Measures\n\nWe believe that our non-IFRS measures are useful to investors for the following reasons:\n\n- Our expense (non-IFRS), and profit (non-IFRS) measures, along with the CCB measure (see above), provide investors with insight into managementâ€™s decision-making because management uses these measures to run our business and make financial, strategic, and operating decisions. We exclude the expense adjustments outlined above when making decisions to allocate resources. In addition, we use these non-IFRS measures to facilitate comparisons of SAPâ€™s operating performance from period to period.\n- The non-IFRS measures provide investors with additional information that enables a comparison of year-over-year operating performance by eliminating certain direct effects of acquisitions, share-based compensation plans, restructuring plans, and regulatory compliance matters.\n- Non-IFRS and non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures are widely used in the software industry. In many cases, inclusion of our non-IFRS measures may facilitate comparison with our competitorsâ€™ corresponding non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures.\n\n# Limitations of Non-IFRS Measures\n\nWithout being analyzed in conjunction with the corresponding IFRS measures, the non-IFRS measures are not indicative of our present and future performance primarily for the following reasons:\n\n- While our profit (non-IFRS) numbers reflect the elimination of certain acquisition-related expenses, no\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
