There were no material divestitures of facilities within the reporting period.\n\n# Report on the Economic Position of SAP SE\n\nSAP SE is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, and is the parent company of the SAP Group, which comprises 235 companies. SAP SE is the Group holding company and employs most of the Group’s Germany-based development and service and support personnel.\n\nAs the owner of the intellectual property in most SAP software, SAP SE derives its revenue mainly from software license fees and bears the bulk of the Group-wide research and development expenses.\n\nIn 2023, as part of Group-internal restructuring measures, SAP America Inc., Newtown Square, United States, repurchased and withdrew own shares from SAP SE. This resulted in a disposal of the shares in affiliated companies in the amount of €4,244 million and a gain from the disposal of affiliated companies in the amount of €3,749 million, reported under Other operating income.\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2023, based on a merger agreement concluded on August 9, 2023, SAP SE took over all assets and liabilities of SAP Portals Europe GmbH, Walldorf, Germany. The merger was conducted at book value.\n\nThe SAP SE annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with the reporting standards in the German Commercial Code and the German Stock Corporation Act. The full SAP SE annual financial report and unqualified audit report are submitted to the operator of the Unternehmensregister (German Business Register) for publication and inclusion in the Unternehmensregister (German Business Register). It is available from SAP SE on request.\n\nProduct revenue and operating profit are defined as the most significant financial performance indicators with regards to SAP SE's standalone financial statements.\n\n86/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Performance Against Our Outlook for 2023\n\n| |Results for 2022|Outlook for 2023|Results for 2023|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Product revenue|€13,550 million|slight increase|€14,055 million|\n|Operating profit|€739 million|slight decrease|€4,396 million|\n\nWhile product revenue is within our 2023 outlook, operating profit is well above expectations at €4,396 million. This development is mainly attributable to the €3,749 million gains realized under the intra-Group share buyback. The course of business for SAP SE was favorable in 2023.\n\n# Income\n\nSAP SE’s income statement is classified following the nature of expense method and presents amounts in millions of euros.\n\n# SAP SE Income Statement − German Commercial Code (Short Version)\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Total revenue|19,018|17,786|\n|Other operating income|4,996|1,534|\n|Cost of services and materials|–12,217|–11,560|\n|Personnel expenses|–3,386|–2,905|\n|Depreciation and amortization|–686|–682|\n|Other operating expenses|–3,329|–3,433|\n|Operating profit|4,396|739|\n|Finance income|897|1,685|\n|Income before taxes|5,292|2,424|\n|Income taxes|–504|–497|\n|Income after taxes|4,788|1,927|\n|Other taxes|–23|–14|\n|Net income|4,766|1,912|\n\nThe total revenue of SAP SE in 2023 was €19,018 million (2022: €17,786 million), an increase of 7%. Product revenue increased 4% to €14,055 million (2022: €13,550 million). As in previous years, product revenue was primarily generated from license fees paid by subsidiaries of SAP SE. Service revenue increased 11% to €1,065 million in 2023 (2022: €958 million), while other revenue increased 19% to €3,898 million (2022: €3,278 million).\n\nSAP SE operating profit increased €3,656 million to €4,396 million (2022: €739 million). Other operating income increased €3,463 million to €4,996 million (2022: €1,534 million). The year-over-year increase is primarily due to €3,749 million in gains from the disposal of affiliated companies as a result of the intra-Group share buyback by SAP America Inc.\n\nSAP SE cost of services and materials increased 6% to €12,217 million (2022: €11,560 million). Services received increased €579 million to €10,177 million (2022: €9,599 million), mainly due to increased services received in the context of intra-Group cost allocations. The costs for licenses and commissions increased €93 million to €2,006 million (2022: €1,914 million).\n\nSAP SE personnel expenses,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
