SAP partners build innovative extensions for SAP applications based on SAP BTP, and in doing so, enhance the customer value offered by SAP. We continue to focus on developing new talent and capacity in the partner ecosystem to support the increased demand for customer cloud transformations.\n\nBy providing innovations that extend SAP applications, partners can influence the adoption of SAP technologies to support customers’ unique business needs. Thus, customers maximize their SAP investment through partner offerings such as industry-specific solutions, LoB solutions, added functionality, and sustainability offerings.\n\nPartners constantly respond to market needs while raising awareness around strategic offerings, such as RISE with SAP, SAP BTP, and our industry cloud solutions, which drive the transformation in the cloud for our customers. Partners offer customers a vast array of SAP technologies and services specific to their LoB or industry, making it easy for customers to purchase the right combination of products, solutions, and services (such as consulting, implementation, and development) to meet their business needs.\n\nPartners contribute to SAP’s growth by expanding market reach in sales and services, specifically by retaining and increasing sales to existing customers, attracting new customers, accessing new markets, and addressing our joint customers’ requirements with their expertise and solution innovations.\n\nTogether with all the aforementioned measures, this may positively impact our revenue, profit, cash flows, customer satisfaction and retention, and enable SAP to exceed our stated medium-term prospects.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Opportunities from Our Employees\n\nOur employees drive innovation, provide value to our customers, and consistently enable our growth and profitability. We continuously invest in our people with the aim of retaining their high level of engagement, further strengthening their skills, fostering an agile and innovative organization, and ensuring a healthy, diverse, and inclusive workforce. By doing so, we anticipate improvements in our employee productivity and innovation capabilities.\n\nOur outlook and medium-term prospects are based on certain assumptions regarding employee retention and our Business Health Culture Index. Should these develop at a rate that is better than expected, employee productivity and engagement may increase. A stronger-than-expected increase in the Employee Engagement Index can therefore be an opportunity that could positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows, enabling SAP to exceed our stated medium-term prospects.\n\nFor more information about future opportunities relating to our employees, see the Employees section.\n\n# Executive Board’s Overall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks\n\nIn our view, considering their impact level and likelihood of occurrence, the risks described in our aggregated risk report do not individually or cumulatively threaten our ability to continue as a going concern. While individual risks, individual opportunities, and assessments may have changed during 2023, our overall risk profile and overall opportunities profile did not change materially compared to the prior year. Management remains confident that the Group’s earnings strength forms a solid basis for our future business development and provides the necessary resources to pursue the opportunities available to the Group. Based on our structured processes for early risk identification, we are confident that, in 2024, we can continue to counter the challenges arising from the risks in our current risk profile.\n\n149/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Responsibility Statement\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, finances, and operating results of the SAP Group, and the management report of the Group and SAP SE includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and SAP SE, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group and SAP SE.\n\nWalldorf, February 21, 2024\n\nSAP SE\n\nWalldorf, Germany\n\n# Executive Board of SAP SE\n\nChristian Klein\n\nDominik Asam\n\nDr. Jürgen Müller\n\nScott Russell\n\nThomas Saueressig\n\nGina Vargiu-Breuer\n\nJulia White\n\n150/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Consolidated Income Statements of SAP Group for the Years Ended December 31\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................153\n\n# Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income of SAP Group for the Years Ended December 31\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................154\n\n# Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of SAP Group as at December 31\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................155\n\n# Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity of SAP Group for the Years Ended December 31\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................156\n\n# Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of SAP Group for the Years Ended December 31\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................157\n\n# Notes\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................158\n\n# (IN.1) Basis for Preparation\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................158\n\n# Section A – Customers\n\n# (A.1) Revenue\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................162\n\n# (A.2) Trade and Other Rece\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP SE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP SE is a multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, headquartered in Walldorf, Germany.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALLDORF<|>GEO<|>Walldorf is a town in Germany, known as the headquarters of SAP SE.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTIAN KLEIN<|>PERSON<|>Christian Klein is a member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, involved in the company's strategic direction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMINIK ASAM<|>PERSON<|>Dominik Asam is a member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, contributing to financial and operational strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
