Operating profit was impacted by a reduced contribution from software licenses revenue and from increased total operating expenses. Share-based payment expenses increased to €2,220 million (2022: €1,431 million), mainly due to an increase in the SAP share price of more than €40 from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023 (January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022: drop in the SAP share price of around €30). A shorter contract life for on-premise support contracts led to accelerated amortization of costs related to these contracts, resulting in higher amortization expenses amounting to €121 million for 2023 (2022: €0 million). Furthermore, higher personnel costs were driven by higher bonus expenses prompted by strong revenue growth and robust attainment of other bonus measures. In addition, the recognition of a provision for fines in regard to anti-bribery matters led to expenses of €155 million in 2023 (2022: €0 million). Operating profit was also impacted by investments in the Next-Generation Cloud Delivery campaign and in other research and development and sales and marketing initiatives to capture current and future growth opportunities. Next-Generation Cloud Delivery from SAP is the modernization of our cloud delivery to enable a more resilient and scalable cloud infrastructure, and ended mid-2023. Additionally, the prior-year operating profit included a disposal gain of €175 million from the sale of the SAP Litmos business.\n\n# Operating Profit1\n\n| | |€ millions|change since previous year|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2019|6,623|48%| |\n|2020|6,308|-5%| |\n|2021|6,090|-3%| |\n|2022|5,787|-5%| |\n|2023| |-22%| |\n\n1 The numbers for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect continuing operations as a result of the divestiture of Qualtrics.\n\n75/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Operating Margin1\n\n|Year|Operating Margin (%)|Change since previous year (pp)|\n|---|---|---|\n|2019|24.2|-6.9|\n|2020|23.4|-0.8|\n|2021|20.6|-2.8|\n|2022|18.5|-2.1|\n|2023|16.2| |\n\n1 The numbers for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflect continuing operations as a result of the divestiture of Qualtrics.\n\n# Changes to the individual elements in our cost of revenue were as follows:\n\n# Cost of Cloud and Software\n\nCost of cloud and software consists primarily of costs for deploying and operating cloud solutions, the cost of developing custom solutions that address customers’ specific business requirements, and customer support costs.\n\nIn 2023, the cost of cloud and software increased 8% to €5,267 million (2022: €4,883 million) and our cloud margin increased 2.2pp from 69.4% in 2022 to 71.6% in 2023, based on strong revenue growth paired with a slower growth in cost of cloud due to a scalable cloud infrastructure and operational efficiency. The software licenses and software support margin was 89.6%, 0.5pp below the prior-year level (2022: 90.1%). Software licenses and software support revenue decreased 5% to €13,261 million (2022: €13,965 million), primarily attributable to a 14% decline in software revenue. Software licenses and software support costs remained relatively constant year over year at €1,383 million (2022: €1,384 million).\n\n# Cost of Services\n\nCost of services consists primarily of the cost of consulting, premium services, and training courses, and the cost of bought-in consulting and training resources. The cost of services increased 8% to €3,407 million (2022: €3,155 million), in line with increased demand for project consulting and premium engagement services as well as higher business travel costs as COVID-related travel restrictions further eased around the world. Our gross margin on services, defined as services profit as a percentage of services revenue, decreased 3.1pp to 20.5% (2022: 23.6%). As our services business trends away from traditional software licensing and consulting revenue toward more subscription revenue from cloud solutions, we continue to adjust our service delivery resources to support our cloud offerings.\n\n# Research and Development\n\nOur research and development (R&D) expense consists primarily of the personnel cost of our R&D employees, costs incurred for independent contractors whom we retain to assist in our R&D activities, and depreciation of the computer hardware and amortization of the software we use for our R&D activities.\n\nThe R&D expense rose 4% to €6,324 million in 2023 from €6,080 million in 2022. This increase was mainly due to higher personnel costs driven by a 3% year-over-year growth in our R&D headcount for additional capacity demands in relation to the increased revenue. The R&D expense was also impacted by several initiatives to capture current and future growth opportunities. R&D expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 20.3% in 2023 (2022: 20.6%).
