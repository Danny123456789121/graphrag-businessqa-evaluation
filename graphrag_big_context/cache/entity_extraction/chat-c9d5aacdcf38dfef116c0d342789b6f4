Agile because of the evolving impacts of climate change and the rapid pace of progress in AI and climate science; and collaborative and transparent because no single stakeholder necessarily has access to all the data and expertise needed to address its climate challenges—and insights often bloom when different perspectives come together.\n\nAs we argue in this report, even at the current state of the technology, AI has the potential to make a significant net positive contribution to addressing the climate challenge—and there are already many inspiring lighthouse examples of its application.

Scope 2 comprises indirect emissions from purchased energy (for example, electricity).
