Following the close of the transaction in September 2021 (after satisfaction of all closing conditions including regulatory approvals), SAP and Dediq jointly own the new SAP Fioneer entity (with SAP owning a minority share).\n\nSAP and SAP Fioneer have executed transition service and go-to-market agreements, among others. The disposal gain relating to the transfer of the business (predominantly IP and employees) was included in Other operating income/expense, net (€77 million).\n\n# (D.2) Goodwill\n\n# Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\n\nThe annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of our operating segments, since there are no lower levels in SAP at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. In general, the test is performed at the same time (at the beginning of the fourth quarter) for all operating segments.\n\nIn making impairment assessments for our goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of these tests is highly dependent on management’s assumptions regarding future cash flow projections and economic risks, which require significant judgment and assumptions about future developments. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\n- Changes in business strategy\n- Internal forecasts\n- Estimation of weighted-average cost of capital\n\nChanges to the assumptions underlying our goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments could require material adjustments to the carrying amount of our recognized goodwill and intangible assets as well as the amounts of impairment charges recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe outcome of goodwill impairment tests may also depend on the allocation of goodwill to our operating segments. This allocation involves judgment as it is based on our estimates regarding which operating segments are expected to benefit from the synergies of business combinations. Changes in our segment structure result in the reallocation of goodwill with the reallocated goodwill being calculated based on relative values (if a direct allocation is not possible).\n\n198/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Goodwill\n\n|€ millions|Historical cost|\n|---|---|\n|1/1/2022|31,190|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences|1,526|\n|Additions from business combinations|560|\n|Retirements/disposals|–95|\n|12/31/2022|33,181|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences|–849|\n|Additions from business combinations|867|\n|Retirements/disposals|–4,008|\n|12/31/2023|29,191|\n\n# Accumulated amortization\n\n|€ millions|Accumulated amortization|\n|---|---|\n|1/1/2022|102|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences|2|\n|12/31/2022|104|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences|–1|\n|12/31/2023|103|\n\n# Carrying amount\n\n|€ millions|Carrying amount|\n|---|---|\n|12/31/2022|33,077|\n|12/31/2023|29,088|\n\nFor more information about our segments and the changes in 2023, see Note (C.1).\n\nThroughout 2023, we have – through a qualitative and quantitative analysis – been continuously monitoring whether triggering events exist. We did not identify any triggering events that would indicate or cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.\n\nFor impairment testing purposes, the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the operating segments expected to benefit from goodwill as follows:\n\n# Goodwill by Operating Segment\n\n|€ millions|Applications, Technology & Services|Qualtrics1|Emarsys|Taulia2|Network|Sustainability|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|12/31/2022|27,221|4,083|395|294|1,052|32|33,077|\n|12/31/2023|27,392|0|395|296|976|29|29,088|\n\n1 The Qualtrics segment was dissolved after the divestiture of SAP’s share in Qualtrics International Inc.\n\n2 Taulia goodwill opening balance was adjusted by €28 million in 2023.\n\nDue to the dissolution of the SAP Signavio segment at the beginning of 2023 (for more information, see Note (C.1)), the SAP Signavio goodwill (€410 million) was moved to the Applications, Technology & Services segment. Given the close proximity to the 2022 annual goodwill impairment test and the significant headroom, no formal impairment test was performed on the reallocation date of the SAP Signavio segment.\n\nBased on the expected synergies, the goodwill added through the acquisition of LeanIX (€867 million) was provisionally allocated to the Applications, Technology & Services segment on December 31. As the initial accounting for the LeanIX business combination is incomplete (for more information, see Note (D.1)), the allocation is provisional. The goodwill impairment test for the Applications, Technology & Services segment on October 1 resulted in a headroom that is significantly higher than the portion of\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nthe goodwill that – at the end of December – was allocated to the segment.
