In Germany and some other countries, we make contributions to public pension schemes that are operated by national or local government or similar institutions. Expenses for such local state pension plans are recognized as short-term employee benefits, that is, social security expenses.\n\n# Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe discount rates used in measuring our post-employment benefit assets and liabilities are derived from rates available on high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds for which the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and the amounts of our projected pension payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized as employee benefits expenses and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities that the employees owning the awards perform. Since our domestic defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of an employee-financed post-retirement plan that is fully financed with qualifying insurance policies, current service cost may become a credit as a result of adjusting the defined benefit liability’s carrying amount to the fair value of the qualifying plan assets. Such adjustments are recorded in service cost. Total expenses on defined benefit pension plans comprise related current and past service costs as well as interest income and expense.\n\n# Total Expense of Pension Plans\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Defined contribution plans|381|425|328|\n|Defined benefit pension plans|57|22|62|\n|Pension expenses|438|447|390|\n\n# Defined Benefit Plans\n\n# Present Value of the Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) and the Fair Value of the Plan Assets\n\n|€ millions|Domestic Plans|Foreign Plans|Other Foreign Post-Employment Plans|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Present value of the DBO|1,060|686|256|2,002|\n|Fair value of the plan assets|1,063|672|98|1,833|\n|Net defined benefit liability (asset)¹|0|64|158|222|\n|Thereof: Net defined benefit asset|0|–17|–63|–79|\n|Net defined benefit liability|0|80|221|301|\n|Net defined benefit asset as % of Non-current|0|0|1|1|\n|Net defined benefit liability as % of Non-current|0|19|51|69|\n\n¹ After the effects of the asset ceiling\n\nOf the present value of the DBO of our domestic plans, €1,006 million (2022: €899 million) relate to plans that provide for lump-sum payments not based on final salary; of the present value of the DBO of our foreign plans, €535 million (2022: €448 million) relate to plans that provide for annuity payments not based on final salary.\n\n179/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThe following significant weighted average assumptions were used for the actuarial valuation of our domestic and foreign pension liabilities as well as other post-employment benefit obligations as at the respective measurement date:\n\n# Significant Actuarial Assumptions\n\n|Percent|Domestic Plans|Domestic Plans|Domestic Plans|Foreign Plans|Foreign Plans|Foreign Plans|Other Foreign Post-Employment Plans|Other Foreign Post-Employment Plans|Other Foreign Post-Employment Plans|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023|2022|2021|2023|2022|2021|\n|Discount rate|3.5|4.2|1.2|2.0|2.6|0.5|5.3|5.5|3.1|\n\nThe sensitivity analysis table below shows how the present value of all defined benefit obligations would have been influenced by reasonably possible changes to significant\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is a country in Europe where SAP operates and contributes to public pension schemes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Defined Contribution Plans are pension plans where contributions are made based on a percentage of employees' salaries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Defined Benefit Pension Plans are pension plans that provide a predetermined payout at retirement, based on salary and years of service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENSION PLANS<|>EVENT<|>Pension Plans are financial arrangements designed to provide income to individuals during retirement.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMANY<|>SAP operates in Germany and contributes to public pension schemes in the country<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS<|>PENSION PLANS<|>Defined Contribution Plans are a type of Pension Plan that involves contributions based on employee salaries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS<|>PENSION PLANS<|>Defined Benefit Pension Plans are another type of Pension Plan that guarantees a specific payout<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
