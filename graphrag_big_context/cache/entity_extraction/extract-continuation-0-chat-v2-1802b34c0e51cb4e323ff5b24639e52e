Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents—67 percent—expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\n\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations—in line with what we found last year—as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\n\nLooking ahead, most respondents—67 percent—expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\n# Exhibit 5\n\nIn most industries, organizations are about equally likely to invest more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in generative AI and analytical AI.\n\n# Share of organization’s digital budget spent on generative AI, % of respondents\n\n|Technology|11|10|16|16|40|7|&gt;20%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Energy and materials|17|7|9|8|46|13|11–15%|\n| | | | | | | |6–10%|\n| | | | | | | |≤5%|\n|Financial services|11|4|26| |47|12|Don’t know|\n|Media and telecommunications|7|4|6|7|60| |16|\n|Consumer goods and retail|5|6|12| |64| |12|\n|Advanced industries|5|18| | |70|6| |\n|Business, legal, and professional services|5|4|3|7|63| |19|\n|Healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical products|3|8|2|5|61| |21|\n|Overall|6|7|7|13|55| |12|\n\n# Share of organization’s digital budget spent on analytical AI technology, % of respondents\n\n|Technology|18|5|13|23|28|13| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Energy and materials|3|5|9|11| |66|7|\n|Financial services|12|11|6|13|44|14| |\n|Media and telecommunications|11|3|7|10|48|21| |\n|Consumer goods and retail|16|3|8|11|48|13| |\n|Advanced industries|6|1|17| |67|7| |\n|Business, legal, and professional services|11|23|3| |47|34| |\n|Healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical products|15|2|6|18|37|22| |\n|Overall|11|6|8|14|45|16| |\n\n1Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.\n\nQuestion was asked only of respondents who said their organizations have adopted AI in at least 1 business function.
