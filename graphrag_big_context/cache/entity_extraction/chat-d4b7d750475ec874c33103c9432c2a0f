SAP strives to not consider EACs from government-supported power plants.|\n|Vintage|The renewable electricity must be produced in the same year or the year preceding the reporting period to which it will be applied.|\n|EKOenergy|All of our purchased renewable electricity is EKOenergy-certified, a high-quality, internationally recognized not-for-profit ecolabel for renewable energy installations that fulfill additional sustainability criteria. Through the purchase of EKOenergy-certified electricity, we also contribute to EKOenergy’s Climate Fund, which finances solar projects tackling energy poverty.|\n\n# Calculation\n\nFor our carbon neutrality target we implement the following calculation approach for renewable electricity:\n\n# Carbon Neutrality\n\n- The amount of renewable electricity used by SAP is calculated by adding the amounts of renewable electricity a) produced onsite, b) covered by EACs, and c) sourced through local green tariff agreements.\n- The total of purchased EACs equals the total electricity consumption as well as the caused emissions of all electricity-related Scope 2 categories: electricity in office buildings, electricity in own data centers, electricity in co-location data centers, home office electricity, and e-mobility.\n- The renewable electricity for EACs is only considered if confirmed by an official certificate or written confirmation of our respective EAC suppliers (100% data coverage).\n- For location-based reporting, we consider EACs regardless of the site where the electricity is generated (unbundled EACs). SAP uses the regional- or country-specific emissions factors to calculate the emission reductions achieved by the EACs.\n- In the location-based net carbon emissions, the purchased as well as the self-produced renewable electricity is already deducted from our Scope 2 emissions.\n- For market-based reporting, we apply a region-based market-boundary approach to account for our procured EACs for the market-based emissions. With ‘region-based market-boundary approach’, we refer to mapping the electricity consumption of our SAP sites to defined regions to ensure regional purchasing.\n\n84 SAP aims to consider the latest guidelines on EAC market boundaries. In the 2023 RE100 disclosure report, we achieved an EAC market boundary alignment of 83% based on the criteria of RE100.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Carbon Neutrality\n\n# Scope 3\n\n- Covers electricity consumed by hyperscale services.\n- Market-based reporting: To a large proportion, most of SAP’s hyperscaler providers operate their data centers with renewable electricity sources. To ensure that SAP’s cloud infrastructure runs with 100% renewable electricity, we procure EACs for the remaining electricity consumption not already covered by renewable electricity from our providers. For this purpose, we use the latest available and assured renewable electricity information of our suppliers: For fiscal year 2023, we relied on supplier data from 2022, as externally assured data for 2023 was not yet available at the point of publication of this Integrated Report.\n- In the location-based net carbon emissions, the renewable electricity by our hyperscalers as well as the SAP-procured EACs for any remaining non-renewable electricity consumption is deducted from our Scope 3 hyperscaler emissions.\n- For SAP-procured EACs, we also ensure that it is confirmed by an official certificate or written confirmation of our respective EAC suppliers (100% data coverage).\n\nFor our science-based target (net zero by 2030) baseline, we account Scope 2 market-based emissions in line with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.\n\n# Carbon Offsets\n\nAs outlined in the Energy and Emissions section, SAP invests the equivalent of remaining emissions from our own operations (Scope 1, 2 and selected 3 emissions) in carbon projects to help reach its carbon neutrality target.\n\n# Quality Criteria\n\nTo support credible, genuine projects, SAP’s due diligence approach for its offset providers and nature-based projects are outlined in the Energy and Emissions section. Further details on SAP’s own, annually-reviewed quality expectations can be found below:\n\n# Additionality / Carbon\n\nProjects and benefits shall be additional. Assumptions regarding the baseline shall reflect reality as closely as possible and avoid overstatements. Deforestation shall not have occurred to implement planting projects. The risk of leakage site shall be identified, addressed, and reduced.\n\n# Biodiversity\n\nLocal biodiversity shall be protected or enhanced. Implementors shall ensure native ecosystems are not deteriorated. All planting projects shall grow a selection of genetically diverse, at best native and climate-resilient trees in mixed stands.\n\n# Community\n\nProjects shall be designed to protect or promote human rights. Organizations must identify and consult impacted stakeholders and ensure that projects are implemented in collaboration or with support of local stakeholders.\n\n# Competence\n\nPartners shall have a history of successfully implemented projects and expertise to implement the right projects in the right places. Scientific partnerships and project designs are strongly preferred.\n\n# Compliance\n\nPartners must pass SAP’s standard compliance checks. Projects generating carbon offsets must be independently certified and validated.\n\n# Durability\n\nPartners must implement measures to address causes of nature destruction, and protect the project site during the committed time, ideally permanently. The political environment shall not actively undermine project activities. If the (limited) extraction of timber is required to safeguard project durability, trees shall be responsibly harvested (for example, no large-scale clear-cuts), allowing for regrowth.\n\n# Transparency\n\nOrganizations must initially and regularly disclose selected data to provide transparency. Organizations leveraging technology, satellite imagery, or other tools to increase transparency, protection and/or understanding of the restored area are preferred.\n\n# Calculation\n\nIn the net carbon emissions relevant for our carbon neutrality target, purchased offsets are already deducted from our gross emissions. When our net carbon emission became\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
