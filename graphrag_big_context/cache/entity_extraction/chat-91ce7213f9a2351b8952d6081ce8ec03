SGSC divisions are responsible for areas such as product and application security, cyberdefense, operational security risk management, security compliance, executive protection, physical security, and a Trust Office that supports customers and partners on matters relating to security and compliance.\n\nThe SAP Security and Cloud Compliance Governance Model is designed to ensure executive engagement and facilitates shared responsibility in quarterly SAP Security Advisory Board and Security Council meetings and in periodic updates to the Executive Board.\n\nOur commitment to customers is to be open and transparent about security vulnerabilities. To ensure this, we work with several external stakeholder groups, including the SAP user groups for the Americas and for the German-speaking countries.\n\n# Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe purpose of the SAP Global Security Policy is to provide governance and structure for an appropriate and effective level of information security at SAP and our affiliated businesses. Aligned with the overall SAP corporate strategy and vision, it details management expectations and the strategic goals and objectives for SAP security.\n\nThis policy provides high-level requirements for numerous security domains. These include, but are not limited to, access control, physical security, network security management, incident response, and acceptable use. These requirements apply to all SAP employees, contractors, and consultants, and to external parties that are granted access to SAP information and information assets. SAP reviews the policy annually and enacts modifications as deemed appropriate and necessary to protect SAP and our own and our customersâ€™ data and assets where new threats or vulnerabilities are identified. All SAP employees are required to read and adhere to this internal policy. The SAP Security Policy Framework consists of several levels of security documents that support the requirements described in the policy. In addition, the various LoBs at SAP may have supporting policies, standards, procedures, and practices.\n\n# Due Diligence for Data Protection Topics\n\n# Governance\n\nWithin the scope of their responsibilities, our global data protection officer (DPO) monitors the compliance of activities involving the processing of personal data. The DPO reports to our CFO. Within the Executive Board, the SAP CFO is responsible for compliance and enforcement of data protection and privacy. The DPO is responsible for the SAP Global Data Protection and Privacy Policy that addresses SAPâ€™s data protection governance, and regularly informs the CFO about the status of data protection compliance in the SAP Group.\n\nTo meet and ensure consistent security and data protection compliance, SAP has implemented a formal governance model that assigns clear responsibilities across the SAP Group. Upon request, the DPO attends steering committee meetings and reports on matters relevant to data protection to the Audit and Compliance Committee of the SAP Supervisory Board.\n\nSAP has established a global network of data protection and privacy coordinators (DPPCs) across all SAP Group entities that process personal data. This DPPC network consists of regional and local DPPCs to ensure data protection and privacy compliance on a local level. The DPPC network sensitizes our employees by conducting local training and monitoring the legal landscape. Where new data protection laws evolve, the DPPC network also helps the Data Protection and Privacy (DPP) team, which acts on behalf of the DPO, identify and analyze them. If this requires compliance activities, they align with the affected LoBs and help drive the relevant implementation. Supported by the DPPC network, the DPP team regularly engages with SAP Government Relations to represent SAPâ€™s interests.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nIn the legislative process. In this regard, SAP participates in external working groups aiming at communicating industry-specific interests with respective governments.\n\nSAP has implemented a data protection management system (DPMS) for our organization. The DPMS adheres to the generally recognized standard for data protection management systems as defined in the British Standard BS 10012, which comprises the data protection requirements of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since version 10012:2017. Our DPMS covers almost all LoBs and is planned to be implemented in all acquired companies as well. It is designed as a framework covering all aspects of data protection compliance of SAP organizations and employees. The system is used as SAPâ€™s standard methodology to ensure compliance with data protection legislation. The maintenance of the framework is subject to certification by the British Standards Institution (BSI) that confirms data protection compliance annually.\n\n# Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe SAP Global Data Protection and Privacy Policy sets a Group-wide governance standard and structure for the handling of personal data in accordance with data protection and privacy requirements. It also defines requirements for business processes that involve personal data and assigns clear responsibilities. The data protection principles set out in this policy are generally accepted and enshrined in most data protection laws around the world, including the EU GDPR. These principles provide the general framework in the SAP Group for the processing of personal data. We actively monitor changes to applicable laws and regulations so that we can update our standards on an ongoing basis as necessary to meet data protection compliance. The policy was last updated in 2023.\n\n# How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\n# Security and Cloud Compliance\n\nCompliance processes at SAP adhere to trust-service criteria established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Our security, privacy, confidentiality, and processing integrity controls are designed to achieve the appropriate control objectives. In addition, independent, external auditing partners regularly conduct security compliance audits.\n\nSAP discloses vulnerabilities to customers and provides accompanying patches or instructions when the customer needs to take action. This procedure also applies to the rarer cases where SAP patches to cloud services require customer action. We disclose these instructions using SAP Security Notes published every second Tuesday of the month (Patch Day). By the time any vulnerabilities are disclosed to customers, the patches are already applied on cloud landscapes as a rule. This process is further supported by the publication of Common Vulner\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
