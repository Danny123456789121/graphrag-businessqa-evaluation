identifiable liabilities|214|\n|Total identifiable liabilities|214|\n|Total identifiable net assets|364|\n|Goodwill|867|\n|Total consideration transferred|1,231|\n\nAs we are still obtaining the information necessary to identify and measure certain assets and liabilities, mainly tax-related items, the initial accounting for the LeanIX business combination is still incomplete.\n\nIn general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces.\n\nLeanIX goodwill was attributed to expected synergies from the acquisition, particularly in the following areas:\n\n- Cross-selling to existing SAP customers across all regions, using SAP’s sales organization\n- Creating new offerings by combining LeanIX products and SAP products\n- LeanIX complements the transformation capabilities of SAP Signavio solutions and will give SAP customers unique clarity on the IT landscapes they need to reap the full benefit of business transformation\n\nThe allocation of the goodwill resulting from the LeanIX acquisition to our operating segments depends on how our operating segments actually benefit from the synergies of the LeanIX business combination. For more information, see Note (D.2).\n\n# Impact of the Business Combination on Our Financial Statements\n\nThe amounts of revenue and profit or loss of the LeanIX business acquired in 2023 since the acquisition date were included in our Consolidated Income Statement for 2023 as follows:\n\n|€ millions|2023|Contribution of LeanIX|\n|---|---|---|\n|Revenue|31,207|10|\n|Profit after tax|5,964|–8|\n\nHad LeanIX been consolidated as at January 1, 2023, our revenue and profit after tax for 2023 would not have been materially different.\n\n# 2023 Divestitures\n\n# Qualtrics Disposal\n\nOn March 13, 2023, resulting from a process that was initiated on January 26, 2023, SAP announced it had agreed to sell all of its 423 million shares of Qualtrics International Inc. as part of the acquisition of Qualtrics by funds affiliated with Silver Lake as well as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The sale closed on June 28, 2023, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At a purchase price of US$18.15 in cash per share, SAP’s stake was acquired for\n\n193/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\napproximately US$7.7 billion. To secure the euro countervalue of the US$7.7 billion purchase price, we hedged an amount of US$7.1 billion by entering into a deal contingent forward applying net investment hedge accounting. For more information, see Note (F.1). At the time that Qualtrics was classified as a discontinued operation (following IFRS 5), there was no indication of an impairment (as the fair value less cost of disposal (calculated based on share prices) significantly exceeded the carrying amount).\n\nSAP is a close go-to-market and technology partner for Qualtrics. SAP’s financial results present Qualtrics as a discontinued operation as required under IFRS 5. The Qualtrics disposal group was previously included in the Qualtrics reportable segment.\n\nThe pre-tax disposal gain included in discontinued operations (€3,562 million) was calculated by adjusting the purchase price less the cost of disposal (€7,003 million) for net assets leaving the SAP Group (€5,800 million, consisting mostly of goodwill (€4,007 million) and other intangible assets (€1,294 million)), the corresponding non-controlling interests (€2,337 million), and amounts of other comprehensive income (€22 million). SAP incurred taxes amounting to €799 million in connection with the transaction.\n\nThe cash inflow resulting from the purchase price (€7,068 million) was offset by cash and cash equivalents of €713 million leaving the SAP Group. SAP continues to provide rental guarantees for certain offices used by Qualtrics. Qualtrics is obligated to indemnify SAP with respect to the guarantees.\n\n# Additional financial information relating to Qualtrics is presented in the following tables (revenues and expenses are presented after consolidation of transactions between Qualtrics and SAP’s continuing operations):\n\n|€ millions, unless otherwise stated|2023|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Consolidated Income Statements| | |\n|Cloud revenue|621|1,129|\n|Total revenue|745|1,351|\n|Cost of cloud|–88|–265|\n|Total cost of revenue|–196|–499|\n|Total operating expenses (including total cost of revenue)|–1,155|–2,771|\n|Disposal gain before tax|3,562|0|\n|Operating profit|3,152|–1,420|\n|Profit (loss) before tax|3,162|–1,423|\n|Income tax expense1|–799|64|\n|Profit (loss) after tax|2,363|–1,359|\n|Attributable to owners of parent|2,505|–993|\n|Earnings per share, basic (IFRS, in €)2|2.15|–0.85|\n|Earnings per share, diluted (IFRS, in €)2|2.12|–0.85|\n|Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow| | |\n|Net operating\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
