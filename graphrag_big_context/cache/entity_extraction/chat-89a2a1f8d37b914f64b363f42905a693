Therefore, such interest rate changes do not change the carrying amounts of our non-derivative fixed-rate financial liabilities, as we account for them at amortized cost.\n- Investments in fixed-rate financial assets classified as fair value through profit or\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nLoss were not material at each year end reported. Thus, we do not consider any fixed-rate instruments in the equity-related sensitivity calculation.\n\n– Income or expenses recorded in connection with non-derivative financial instruments with variable interest rates are subject to interest rate risk if they are not hedged items in an effective hedge relationship. Thus, we take into consideration interest rate changes relating to our variable-rate financing and our investments in money market instruments in the profit-related sensitivity calculation.\n\n– The designation of interest rate receiver swaps in a fair value hedge relationship leads to interest rate changes affecting Financial income, net. The fair value movements related to the interest rate swaps are not reflected in the sensitivity calculation, as they offset the fixed interest rate payments for the bonds and private placements as hedged items. However, changes in market interest rates affect the amount of interest payments from the interest rate swap. As a consequence, we include those effects of market interest rates on interest payments in the profit-related sensitivity calculation.\n\nIf, on December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, interest rates had been higher/lower this would have had the following effects on Financial income, net.\n\n# Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\n|€ millions|Effects on Financial Income, Net|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Derivatives held within a designated fair value hedge relationship|Interest rates +100bps for U.S. dollar area/+100bps for euro area (2022: +75/+125bps for U.S. dollar/euro area; 2021: +75/+20bps for U.S. dollar/euro area)|–46|–58|–11|\n| |Interest rates –100bps for U.S. dollar area/–100bps for euro area (2022: –25/–10bps for U.S. dollar/euro area; 2021: –25/–20bps for U.S. dollar/euro area)|46|5|10|\n|Variable-rate financing|Interest rates +100bps for U.S. dollar area/+100bps for euro area (2022: +75/+125bps for U.S. dollar/euro area; 2021: +75/+20bps for U.S. dollar/euro area)|0|–14|–4|\n| |Interest rates –100bps for U.S. dollar area/–100bps for euro area (2022: –25/–10bps for U.S. dollar/euro area; 2021: –25/–20bps for U.S. dollar/euro area)|0|1|3|\n|Variable-rate investments|Interest rates +100bps for U.S. dollar area/+100bps for euro area (2022: +75/+125bps for U.S. dollar/euro area; 2021: +75/+20bps for U.S. dollar/euro area)|32|26|24|\n| |Interest rates –100bps for U.S. dollar area/–100bps for euro area (2022: –25/–10bps for U.S. dollar/euro area; 2021: –25/–20bps for U.S. dollar/euro area)|–32|–5|–9|\n\n# Equity Price Risk\n\n# Equity Price Risk Factors\n\nWe are exposed to equity price risk with regard to our investments in equity securities.\n\n# Equity Price Risk Management\n\nOur listed equity investments are monitored based on the current market value that is affected by the fluctuations in the volatile stock\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
