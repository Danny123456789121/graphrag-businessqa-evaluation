Sustainability Management; Stakeholder Engagement; Materiality; Social Investments; Sustainable Procurement; Waste and Water; Public Policy; Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance; and GRI Content Index excluding quantitative and qualitative information in relation to GRI 207 Tax) and the chapter “About This Report” (hereinafter referred to as “sustainability disclosures”) a limited assurance engagement was performed.\n\n# Responsibility of the Executive Directors\n\nThe executive directors of the Group are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative and in accordance with the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development in combination with internal guidelines as described in the “Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance” (hereinafter: \"Reporting Criteria\") and for the selection of the disclosures to be assessed.\n\nThis responsibility of the executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate sustainability reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal controls as executive directors determine to enable the preparation of the Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Independence and Quality Assurance of the Assurance Practitioner’s Firm\n\nWe have complied with the German professional regulations on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements - in particular the By-laws Regulating the Rights and Duties of Wirtschaftsprüfer and vereidigte Buchprüfer in the exercise of their Profession and the Standards on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW), and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system that includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n# Practitioner’s Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed within the assurance engagement on the sustainability indicators and the sustainability disclosures described above. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, published by IAASB.\n\nAccordingly, we have to comply with our professional duties and to plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we, respecting the principle of materiality, reach our conclusion with a reasonable level of assurance on the above-mentioned sustainability indicators. The assurance of the sustainability indicators encompasses the performance of assurance procedures to obtain evidence for the information included in the Report. The choice of assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgement of the assurance practitioner.\n\nThis Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the above-mentioned sustainability disclosures in the Report of the Group for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the relevant Reporting Criteria. This does not imply that a separate conclusion is expressed on each of the disclosures. In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a significantly lower level of assurance is obtained. The procedures selected depend on the assurance practitioner’s professional judgment.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gain an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees responsible for the materiality analysis in order to gain an understanding of the procedure for identifying material topics and corresponding reporting boundaries of SAP\n- Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees involved in the determination of the sustainability information about the preparation process and about the internal control system related to this process\n- Assessment of the suitability of the internal guidelines and the internally developed definitions for the selected sustainability information\n- Identification of areas in the selected sustainability information where material misstatements are likely to arise\n- Analytical procedures on selected quantitative sustainability information\n- Evaluation of local data collection and reporting processes and reliability of reported data via a sampling survey at Walldorf and (remote) Bangalore (India)\n- Reconciliation of selected data used in the calculation of the selected sustainability information with internal and external documents\n- Recalculation for mathematical accuracy of selected quantitative sustainability information\n- Assessment of the overall presentation of the selected sustainability information\n\nIn addition, we conducted the following procedures to obtain reasonable assurance:\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– Evaluation of the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the systems and methods used to collect and process the data reported for the selected information, including the aggregation of the data into the indicators as presented in the Report\n\n– Auditing the 2023 data using internal and external documentation in order to determine in detail whether the data corresponds to the information in the relevant underlying sources, and whether all the relevant information contained in such underlying sources has been included in the Report\n\n– Evaluation of local information management systems and reliability of reported data via a sampling survey at Walldorf and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that specializes in
