By the end of 2023, Germany transposed the EU\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\ndirective into national law, applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 30, 2023. SAP has performed an assessment of its potential exposure to the global minimum tax legislation. This assessment is based on our current understanding of the global minimum taxation rules and on the most recent information available regarding the financial performance of the constituent entities within SAP. Our simulation reveals that SAP should not be materially affected. SAP has applied the temporary mandatory exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the global minimum tax.\n\n# (C.6) Earnings per Share\n\n|€ millions, unless otherwise stated|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Profit attributable to equity holders of SAP SE|3,634|3,277|6,429|\n|Profit attributable to equity holders of SAP SE1|6,139|2,284|5,256|\n|Issued ordinary shares2|1,229|1,229|1,229|\n|Effect of treasury shares2|–61|–58|–49|\n|Weighted average shares outstanding, basic2|1,167|1,170|1,180|\n|Dilutive effect of share-based payments2|12|5|0|\n|Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted2|1,180|1,175|1,180|\n|Earnings per share, basic, attributable to equity holders of SAP SE (in €)|3.11|2.80|5.45|\n|from continuing operations| | | |\n|Earnings per share, basic, attributable to equity holders of SAP SE (in €)1|5.26|1.95|4.46|\n|Earnings per share, diluted, attributable to equity holders of SAP SE (in €)|3.08|2.79|5.45|\n|from continuing operations| | | |\n|Earnings per share, diluted, attributable to equity holders of SAP SE (in €)1|5.20|1.94|4.46|\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Section D – Invested Capital\n\nThis section highlights our non-current assets including investments that form the basis of our operating activities. Additions to invested capital include separate asset acquisitions or business combinations. Further, we disclose information about purchase obligations and capital contributions.\n\n# (D.1) Business Combinations and Divestitures\n\n# Measuring Non-Controlling Interests and Allocation of Consideration Transferred\n\nWe decide for each business combination whether to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. We classify costs related to executing business combinations as general and administration expense. In our accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in determining whether an intangible asset is identifiable and whether it should be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves considerable judgment. The necessary measurements are based on information available on the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. These judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially affect our financial position and profit for several reasons, including the following:\n\n- Fair values assigned to assets subject to depreciation and amortization affect the amounts of depreciation and amortization to be recorded in operating profit in the periods following the acquisition.\n- Subsequent negative changes in the estimated fair values of assets may result in additional expense from impairment charges.\n- Subsequent changes in the estimated fair values of liabilities and provisions may result in additional expense (if increasing the estimated fair value) or additional income (if decreasing the estimated fair value).\n\nWe acquire businesses in specific areas of strategic interest to us, particularly to broaden our product and service portfolio.\n\n# 2023 Acquisitions\n\n# LeanIX Acquisition\n\nOn September 7, 2023, SAP announced its intent to acquire 100% of the shares of LeanIX GmbH (“LeanIX”), a leader in enterprise architecture management (EAM) software. The acquisition closed on November 7, 2023, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals; the operating results and the assets and liabilities are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements starting on that date. The acquisition is expected to further expand SAP’s business transformation portfolio, giving customers access to the full suite of tools required for continuous business transformation and facilitating AI-enabled process optimization. Consideration transferred amounted to €1,231 million paid in cash.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThe following table summarizes the values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of LeanIX, as at the acquisition date:\n\n|LeanIX Acquisition: Recognized Assets and Liabilities|LeanIX Acquisition: Recognized Assets and Liabilities|\n|---|\n|€ millions| |\n|Intangible assets|476|\n|Other identifiable assets|102|\n|Total identifiable assets|578|\n|Other identifiable liabilities|214|\n|Total identifiable liabilities|214|\n|Total identifiable net assets|364|\n|Goodwill|867|\n|Total consideration transferred|1,231|\n\nAs we are still obtaining the information necessary\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
