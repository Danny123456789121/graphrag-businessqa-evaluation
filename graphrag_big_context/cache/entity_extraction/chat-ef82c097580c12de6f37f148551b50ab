A continued emphasis on operational excellence and experience management is key to delivering our human experience management (HXM) solutions and services efficiently, with both empathy and compliance.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- SAP runs SAP SuccessFactors solutions to manage global SAP people data, and the SAP Analytics Cloud solution to provide analytics and insights.\n\n37 The term “leaders” is inclusive of all SAP colleagues who are in a formal executive or people manager role – either managing a team or managing managers.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\nSAP puts processes and tools in place that enable employees to work flexibly from different locations (including working from home or abroad for personal reasons), in line with local flexible work policies.\n\nThe SAP Signavio Process Intelligence solution provides our HR organization with insights on how HR support tickets flow between the various HR support teams. In addition, we are currently leveraging the SAP Build Process Automation solution to further automate processes such as bonus plans and variable pay.\n\n# Related Risks for SAP\n\n“Human rights and employee matters” is a risk factor that is assessed as part of SAP’s corporate financial risk management system. No material financial risks were identified through our risk framework as described in the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\n# Headcount and Personnel Expense\n\nNumbers disclosed in the Employees section38 are based on headcount (exceptions in FTE are indicated). We define headcount in FTE39 as the number of people on permanent employment contracts, taking into account their staffing percentage. Students, individuals employed by SAP but currently not working for reasons such as maternity/parental leave, and temporary employees on limited contracts of less than six months are excluded from our figures. The number of temporary employees is not material.\n\n|Full-time equivalents|Average number of employees|Average personnel expense/employee in Euro|Restructuring-related terminations in FTE|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|107,602+1,291 2022: 106,312|106,043+173 2022: 105,582|160,000+16,000 2022: 144,000|1,857+1,318 2022: 539|\n\nThe personnel expense for each employee is defined as the overall personnel expense divided by the average number of employees.\n\nFor 2024, we plan a targeted restructuring program in close alignment with social partners, which is expected to affect about 8,000 employees from SAP’s global workforce. For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.8).\n\nFor more information about employee compensation and a breakdown of personnel expense, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (B.1) and Note (B.2).\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nExcept for the quantitative indicators Headcount and Personnel Expense, the content of the Employees section was not subject to the statutory audit of our combined management report. However, our external auditor performed an independent limited assurance engagement for the content of this section. Under this engagement, the quantitative indicators Business Health Culture Index, Employee Engagement Index, Employee Retention, Women in Management, and Women in Executive Roles were audited at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n38 All financial and non-financial numbers in this chapter are based on continuing operations excluding Qualtrics.\n\n39 Thereof acquisitions: 558.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Energy and Emissions\n\n# Vision and Strategy\n\nFor over a decade now, climate action has been at the top of SAP’s corporate sustainability agenda in light of the increasing impacts of climate change and escalating global challenges such as ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. As outlined in the Sustainability Management40 section, we aim to take climate action through our dual approach as enabler and exemplar to help pave the way toward a low-carbon future for our customers, partners, and SAP, and create impact within planetary boundaries.\n\n# Due Diligence\n\n# Governance\n\nAs outlined in the Sustainability Management1 section, the Executive Board sponsorship for sustainability lies with the CEO, and for climate action with the CEO and CFO. The ESG Steering Board (formerly Sustainability Council) serves as a governance body to steer SAP’s corporate sustainability performance. The organizational unit and operating segment responsible for sustainability drives SAP’s holistic, cross-company sustainability agenda. The Office of the Chief Sustainability Officer (oCSO) is part of this unit and continues to shape SAP's response to climate change in close cooperation with other departments. Among other things, the oCSO is responsible for:\n\n- Defining the Environmental Policy and determining a global environmental project portfolio to help steer SAP’s impact\n- Setting reduction and impact targets and embedding sustainability-related initiatives across SAP (for example, running the cross-board Environmental Management System and net-zero program)\n- Evaluating our carbon inventory and monitoring carbon emissions on a quarterly basis\n- Assessing and managing climate-related risks through a quarterly risk review\n- Managing nature-based investment decisions\n- Serving as advisor to our development units to develop solutions\n\nSustainability is a company-wide effort, and initiatives are also driven outside this dedicated unit. For example, the global procurement organization aims to ensure that SAP purchases energy-efficient, sustainable products and services. The global real estate and facilities management team designs and operates many SAP facilities based on robust environmental standards such as ISO 14001:2015 and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program. Our global cloud services organization attends to the optimization of the energy consumption in our data centers, while our SAP IT department encourages employees to use IT equipment and business software responsibly. In addition, to be able to innovate and evolve sustainability further, we regularly engage externally with various stakeholder groups, such as non-governmental\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
