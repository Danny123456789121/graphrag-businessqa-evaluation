The role-based skill program is mandatory for all SAP employees in Customer Success (CS) – excluding contract employees in CS roles in Germany, where the program is considered “highly recommended.”\n5. The role-based skill program consists of the following levels: L100 completion rate: 50%, L200 completion rate: 45%, L300 completion rate: 121%, and Essential Learning completion rate: 53%.\n6. The score is based on three questions (scale: 1 being the lowest, 5 the highest rating) about their experience with the recruiter, their ability to represent the Company, and the opportunities there, and their ability to serve as strategic advisor to find the best fit within the Company for the candidate.\n7.

Development opportunities, meaningful reward packages, and a culture of inclusion foster an environment where the full potential of every individual is realized. It is critical that our employees see the link between their individual contribution and SAP’s future success.\n\n# Goal Setting and Reward Structure\n\nSmart and transparent goal-setting approaches and continuous dialogue\n\n- SAP's top leadership sets goals for their organization based on SAP's and their respective Board area's strategy and focus areas and make them visible to all employees, kicking off a goal cascade through all required leadership levels, down to team and employee goal setting. In the time from January to April, up to 93% of our workforce documented their performance goals in 2023 (2022: 88%).\n- SAP Talk conversation and check-ins throughout the year are designed to ensure manager and employee dialogue, discuss goals defined according to the SMART methodology, agree upon and document these goals, and share feedback.\n\n# Holistic Total Rewards value proposition\n\nOur rewards experiences bring value to our people and SAP. For example, we:\n\n- Ensure fair pay through annual, global reviews of our pay ranges and pay equity, and centrally-funded pay adjustments, so that all employees are within their pay range and acceptable spread of pay differences with peers. Our approach is agnostic of personal characteristics and recognized as market-leading by The Josh Bersin Company.\n- Follow a “pay-for-performance” approach with broad-based and targeted investments to reward individuals’ unique contribution and impact.\n- Empower managers with a real-time analytics dashboard, powered by SAP, to make impactful rewards decisions.\n- Motivate employees to drive our cloud transformation with short-term incentives using a unified KPI of growth in current cloud backlog.\n- Drive ownership through our share-based compensation program, Move SAP, which vests quarterly and is share-settled in most countries (2023: 97% of employees eligible).\n- Ensure ownership is accessible for all employees through our global share purchase plan, Own SAP. Overall participation was 75% in 2023 (2022: 79%) with a collective investment of 6,710,033 shares (2022: 9,183,599).\n- Increase transparency for employees on their holistic rewards offerings – from pay to benefits and equity. Employees now have transparency into their own pay ranges (99.8% of all employees) and the value of top benefits offerings (66% of all employees).\n\nFor more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (B.3).\n\nAt SAP, we strive to be the world’s most inclusive workplace, aiming to create a unique culture where everyone feels a sense of belonging, and human differences are celebrated and valued. As a global organization with employees from 160 nationalities, we strive to consider the full spectrum of human differences and promote inclusion for each one of them (for example, inclusion of gender, race, LGBTQ+, generations, disability, and many other diversities).
