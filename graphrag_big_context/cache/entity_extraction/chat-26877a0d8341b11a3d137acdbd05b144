The LTI 2020 reflects SAP’s long-term strategy and thus sets uniform incentives to achieve key targets from the long-term strategic plans. The LTI 2020 also serves to reward the Executive Board members for long-term SAP share price performance as compared to the market, thus ensuring that shareholders’ interests are also honored. In addition, the LTI 2020 includes a component to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members.\n\nThe LTI 2020 is a virtual share program under which annual tranches with a term of approximately four years each are granted. When the individual tranches are granted, a certain grant amount specified in the Executive Board member’s service contract is converted into virtual shares (share units). For this purpose, the grant amount is divided by the price of the SAP share which corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole (grant price). The share units\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nallocated are composed of 1/3 Financial Performance Share Units (FSUs), 1/3 Market Performance Share Units (MSUs), and 1/3 Retention Share Units. All three types of share units have a vesting period of approximately four years. In contrast to Retention Share Units, FSUs and MSUs are subject to changes in quantity. In this context, the following applies:\n\nThe number of FSUs initially awarded is multiplied by a performance factor. The performance factor consists of three equally weighted individual performance indicators relating to the three non-IFRS KPIs at constant currencies, derived from SAP’s long-term strategy: total revenue, cloud revenue, and operating income. The performance period throughout which the target achievement for these three KPIs is measured starts at the beginning of the financial year in which the FSUs are awarded and concludes upon the end of the second year following the year in which the share units were awarded. A numerical target value equaling 100% target achievement is set for each KPI. This constitutes, in each case, a cumulative value for the three years of the performance period.\n\n| |150%|Cloud revenue|\n|---|---|---|\n| |100%|Total revenue|\n| |50%|Operating income|\n| |0%| |\n| |70%| |\n| |80%| |\n| |90%| |\n| |100%| |\n| |110%| |\n| |120%| |\n| |130%| |\n\nThe number of MSUs initially awarded is likewise multiplied by a performance factor. The performance factor depends on the amount of the TSR on the SAP share, measured for an entire performance period of approximately three years, compared to the TSR for NASDAQ-100 companies. If the TSR on the SAP share equals the median, the performance factor will be 100%. If the TSR on the SAP share over the performance period is negative, the maximum performance factor will, however, in deviation from the summary above, be 100%.\n\n| |200%|\n|---|---|\n| |150%|\n|100%|50%|\n| |Z5th percentile|\n| |Median|\n| |75th percentile|\n\nThe performance of the share units is linked to the performance of the SAP share price, including dividend payments. Accordingly, an amount is paid out for each share unit which equals the SAP share price plus those dividends disbursed in respect of an SAP share in the period from the beginning of the year in which the share units were awarded until the end of the third year following the year in which the share units were awarded. The arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThe whole will be used as the SAP share price. The payout amount per share unit, including the dividend amounts due on the share units, is capped at 200% of the grant price. The tranche is cash-settled and paid in euros after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the corresponding year. If an Executive Board member’s service contract is terminated before the end of the third year following the year in which the share units were granted, the Retention Share Units and PSUs are forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or termination of the service contract.\n\n# Long-Term Incentive 2016 Plan (LTI 2016 Plan)\n\nThe purpose of the LTI 2016 Plan was to reward our Executive Board members for the annual achievement of SAP’s Operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) targets, to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members, and to reward them for the long-term SAP share price performance as compared to its main peer group (Peer Group). An LTI tranche was granted annually and had a term of four years (2016–2019 tranches).\n\nAll share units granted in this way, comprising 60% PSUs and 40% Retention Share Units, had a vesting period of approximately four years.
