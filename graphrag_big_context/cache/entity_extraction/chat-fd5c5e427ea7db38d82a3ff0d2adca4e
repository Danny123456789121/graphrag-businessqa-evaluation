Similarly, in regions with limited smart meter adoption, policymakers could take action by allocating funding for infrastructure modernization or offering incentives to encourage electricity providers to replace aging meters. These measures would facilitate the integration of AI applications designed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\nTo underscore sectoral distinctions, in the following, we provide examples to illustrate how policymakers have begun implementing policies in sector-specific contexts.\n\n35 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Leaders could:\n\nCreate public/private partnerships to drive AI adoption within and across key sectors and applications.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- Buildings: DO IT SMARTer—a public-private partnership between the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Øsfold University College, the Norwegian company NxTech, Romania’s Alba Iulia municipality, and the NGO Center for the Study of Democracy—seeks to develop AI-driven energy efficiency solutions for public buildings in Romania and Norway.\n- Energy: The US Department of Energy’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory is partnering with the Renaissance Fusion startup on AI-driven efforts to accelerate the development of carbon-free fusion energy.\n- Transport: In Project Green Light, Google is collaborating with 12 cities including Manchester, Rio de Janeiro, Jakarta, and Abu Dhabi to reduce stop-and-start events through AI-supported traffic light management. Early indicators show a potential for up to a 30% reduction in stops, which could reduce emissions at intersections up to 10%. This could have a significant impact, as cars at city intersections generate 29 times more pollution than do cars on the open road.\n\nRemove regulatory barriers to and provide regulatory support and clarity for AI adoption.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- Electricity: Spain, Brazil, and Australia have launched regulatory “sandboxes” for their electricity sectors that can offer waivers for climate-related pilots. In Australia, for example, grid participants can be granted exemptions from registering as a network service provider.\n- Agriculture: Key agro-food stakeholders have co-signed a set of non-binding guidelines entitled the EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing. Similarly, The American Farm Bureau Federation has worked with stakeholders to establish the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data.\n\nAccelerate infrastructure modernization and digitalization to enable AI use.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- Buildings: In 2022, the UK government imposed new binding requirements that energy suppliers install smart meters in homes and small businesses. The target, currently under negotiation, aims for 80% smart meter coverage in homes and 73% in small businesses by 2025.\n- Energy: The Modernization Fund is a dedicated funding program to support 10 lower-income EU Member States in modernizing their energy systems and improving energy efficiency (for example, modernization of energy networks, district heating, etc.). Similarly, adopted in late 2022, the Digitalizing the energy sector – EU action plan, which is characterized by cybersecurity, efficiency, and sustainability, aims to cultivate a competitive marketplace for digital energy services and digital energy infrastructure.\n\nSupport AI research and innovation in climate-relevant domains by involving both academia and the private sector.\n\n# Examples:\n\n- Energy: In May 2023, the US Department of Energy announced a $40 million investment in 15 projects focused on developing high-performance, energy-efficient cooling solutions for data centers.\n- Agriculture: The EU’s Horizon 2020 program for research and innovation has allocated more than €200 million to support the deployment of precision farming.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE 36\n\n# Industry: The UK’s Project Bluebird\n\nis creating a digital twin of UK airspace that, by identifying ways to make air traffic control more efficient, can help the aviation industry achieve its goal of net zero by 2050.\n\n# Urban planning: Virtual Singapore\n\na collaboration between the National Research Foundation, the Land Authority, and the Government Technology Agency—uses topographic and dynamic data to create a 3D digital replica of the nation state that is the official platform for simulation and virtual testing of urban planning solutions.\n\n# Optimize incentives to drive AI adoption at scale for climate action priorities when existing mechanisms are insufficient (for example, public funding, tax credits, etc.).\n\n# Examples:\n\n# Agriculture:\n\nAustralia has launched the Farms of the Future AgTech Grant Program to encourage farmers to adopt precision agriculture to boost productivity and improve resource management, including water efficiency and drought readiness.\n\n# Buildings:\n\nThe US Federal-State Buy Clean Partnership is a commitment by the federal government and 13 states to purchase lower-carbon materials for federal and state-funded projects with the goal of reducing emissions and sending a unified demand signal to the market.\n\n# Industry:\n\nSingapore’s Energy Efficiency Fund offers five different grant programs that reimburse businesses up to 70% of investments that improve the energy efficiency of industrial facilities. Similarly, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is offering subsidies to promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in the industrial and commercial sectors.\n\n# Guide AI for Climate\n\nPolicymakers play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of AI—not just in accelerating its positive contributions, but also in minimizing its potential negative impacts. With regard to AI for climate, clear principles and guidelines are essential in two areas: first, maximizing the environmental friendliness of AI applications, and second, ensuring that AI applications respect the privacy and diversity of people and do not inadvertently exacerbate inequalities. We discuss each in turn.\n\n# Address Environmental Impacts of AI Operations\n\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, AI has its own environmental footprint. And while it has not yet been comprehensively measured, it is essential that we monitor and manage it.\n\nAI developers recognize the necessity of minimizing AI’s environmental footprint, especially in the context of expanding the use of AI—and are already working to make algorithms and data centers more energy efficient and to increase their commitment to renewables. For instance, in terms of clean energy utilization, several organizations such as the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) in the US, RE-Source\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
