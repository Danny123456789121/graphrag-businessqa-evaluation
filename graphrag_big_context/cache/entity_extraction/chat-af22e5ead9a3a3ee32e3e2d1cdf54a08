AI can also deliver insights, revealing patterns in emissions and suggesting the best ways to prioritize abatement efforts.\n\nIn the domain of macro-level measurement, Climate TRACE has been an early mover. This nonprofit offers free emissions data for more than 80,000 individual sources and facilities around the globe, providing a data foundation to help organizations get started with mitigation plans. Its data could, for example, assist countries seeking to transition away from coal and other fossil-fuel based electricity generation by pinpointing the largest emitters and revealing the mix of power sources by region. (See the sidebar Climate TRACE: Providing Timely, Independent Emissions Dataâ€”for Free.)\n\nSolutions are emerging for micro-level measurement as well. Googleâ€™s Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE) uses machine learning to offer city planners annual estimates of emissions from buildings and transportation, tree canopy status, and emissions reduction opportunities such as the potential for expanded rooftop solar. Houston, Texas, used EIE to perform a solar assessment and inform the development of its 5 million MWh Solar Energy Target Plan. Similarly, CO2 AI, a novel SaaS platform, enables business leadersâ€”together with their value chain partnersâ€”to develop an accurate estimate of their organizationsâ€™ Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions down to the product level. It also helps them to model and evaluate emissions reduction opportunities. (See the sidebar CO2 AI: Helping Business Ecosystems Reduce their Carbon Footprints.)\n\nSource: BCG, AI for the Planet Alliance.\n\n# Climate TRACE: Providing Timely, Independent Emissions Dataâ€”for Free\n\nMaking real progress on climate requires timely and accurate data on emissions to inform government policy and business action. But historically, emissions data has been based on self-reporting, calculated using varying algorithms, and submitted years after the fact. Climate TRACEâ€”a global coalition of nonprofits, tech startups, and researchersâ€”offers a powerful, free, and independent alternative: the first comprehensive source-level global inventory of GHG emissions.\n\nSupported by Google.org, among others, Climate TRACE uses AI and machine learning to calculate GHG emissions on a global scale, with the goal of moving toward real-time precision. To achieve this, its model analyzes more than 59 terabytes of data from over 300 satellites and more than 11,000 sensors to create highly granular emissions data for over 80,000 sources globally. That number is expected to grow to more than 70 million sources by the end of 2023.\n\n# Application area: Macro-Level Measurement\n\n|Climate TRACE tracks global emissions|EURD|56.15|B TONNES of CO2 in 2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Source: Climate TRACE.

Until now, that kind of single source of truth has not been available to help operations leaders understand emissions hot spots and explore potential solutions.\n\nCO2 AI, an innovative SaaS platform, helps organizations seamlessly map emissions across their value chains and leverage those insights to drive climate action. AI plays a central role in both assembling emissions data and matching it to activities and productsâ€”and in simulating solutions and building decarbonization roadmaps.\n\nIn one example, a global health care company seeking to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2030 embraced CO2 AI. The platform enabled it to incorporate 50 times more factors into its calculations and to develop an activity based emissions baseline that was 20% more precise. And CO2 AIâ€™s simulation and roadmapping tools enabled it to identify decarbonization opportunities that would deliver 120% of its emission reduction target.\n\n# Application area: Micro-Level Measurement\n\n# Measuring and managing emissions with CO2 AI\n\n# Plan reductions\n\nYour company has 15 ongoing initiatives to reduce its footprint among which 6 in the roadmap:\n\n|Emission scope in 2023|Roadmap target|\n|---|---|\n|89% of emissions come from Scope 3|Current emissions are 18% away from target|\n\n|Scope|Scope 2|Cycle 2023|Cycle 2033|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Scope 1|195.58 kt CO2e|96.97 kt CO2e|Target|\n|Current cycle|Projected with initiatives|Current total| |\n|2.50|0.50| | |\n\nScope 3: Total increase achieved from baseline\n\n|Latest footprint|Target footprint|\n|---|---|\n|2.58 Mt CO2e|211 Mt CO2e|\n\nSource: CO2 AI.
