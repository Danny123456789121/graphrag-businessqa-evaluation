The ecological aspect—undertaking practices enabling employees to develop pro-ecological behaviours.\n\nThe analysis of the results shows a right-hand asymmetry of the distribution of variants of answers to most questions (except statement 3). The respondents most often stated that the pro-ecological practices indicated in the questionnaire were not undertaken in their enterprises or that they had a problem with an unambiguous response to particular statements (answer “hard to say”). Mode in all statements (except for 3) is 2 (answer “no”). Positive answers (from “rather yes” to “definitely yes”) did not prevail in the assessment of any of the statements.\n\nThe respondents most often (42%) indicated that employees in their enterprises use public transport to travel to work (statement 3). According to the respondents, the least frequently used practice (15% of positive answers) was compensating employees for the costs of commuting to work by public transport. Less than 1/3 of the respondents stated that their enterprise takes into account ecological criteria both at the stage of recruitment and employee evaluation.\n\n# 3.1.4.
