This procedure also applies to the rarer cases where SAP patches to cloud services require customer action. We disclose these instructions using SAP Security Notes published every second Tuesday of the month (Patch Day). By the time any vulnerabilities are disclosed to customers, the patches are already applied on cloud landscapes as a rule. This process is further supported by the publication of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE documents) through MITRE that enable integration with the customer’s existing vulnerability and risk management tools. MITRE is a disclosure mechanism that provides customers with authoritative, public information from SAP about SAP software vulnerabilities that can be integrated with their existing risk management processes and tools.\n\nWe strive to reduce risk by continuously improving our processes for detecting and remediating attacks and vulnerabilities. To that end, we:\n\n- Engage in internal and external audits across SAP globally\n- Monitor and support our cloud and IT units with more than 2,800 controls that are audited and tested for design and operational effectiveness\n- Offer service organization control (SOC) reports – such as SOC 1 Type II/ISAE 3402 and SOC 2 Type II/ISAE 3000 – to provide insights into the design and operational effectiveness of internal control systems implemented within cloud delivery units\n- Have external internationally accredited auditors assess and certify our cloud services according to various reporting standards and ISO certifications, such as ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 22301, and BS 10012\n\n101/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Data Protection\n\nTo help ensure necessary knowledge about data protection, global data protection and privacy training is mandatory for SAP employees. The training is conducted every two years, with the latest rolled out in 2023. This training helps our workforce handle personal data with due care and in accordance with the law and to maintain compliance with data protection requirements in their work. We monitor compliance of data protection-relevant procedures across SAP. We maintain a record of processing activities (“procedure enrollment tool”), in which all procedures that process personal data must be documented. These records contain general information about the procedure according to clearly defined criteria that are necessary to meet proper documentation. The records are reportable and regularly reviewed.\n\nWe also track the quality of our data protection compliance level based on the annual recertification of our DPMS by the BSI. SAP has been audited by the BSI annually and awarded certifications according to BS 10012 since 2011. The most recent certification is valid until end of 2025.\n\nSAP’s own quality standards and international regulations require careful selection and monitoring of subprocessors processing personal data on behalf of SAP and SAP customers. With the goal that all subprocessors meet data protection and security requirements for the processing of personal data, SAP has implemented a subprocessor verification process that is part of the overall SAP Third-Party Risk Management framework.\n\nSAP respects the rights of the data subjects to obtain information as to whether personal data concerning them is being processed. All necessary information is made available to the data subjects within the framework of the privacy statements on the respective SAP Web sites.\n\nIn 2023, there were two notifiable data protection incidents in accordance with the GDPR for data that SAP processes for its own purposes and were reported to the supervisory authorities.\n\n# Related Risks for SAP\n\nFor related financial risks, see the Risk Management and Risks section, specifically the Cybersecurity and Security and Data Protection and Privacy subsections.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Security, Cloud Compliance, Data Protection and Privacy section was not subject to the statutory audit of our combined management report. However, our external auditor performed an independent limited assurance engagement for the content of this section.\n\n102/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Employees\n\n# Vision and Strategy\n\nPeople are at the heart of our organization. Aiming for a highly engaged, diverse, future-fit workforce equipped with the right skills helps SAP attract and retain the best talent.\n\nAs part of People & Operations, our People Strategy connects with our go-to-market and product strategies, bringing together the essential fabric of SAP’s transformation: our people, processes, and technology. Since 2020, we have been evolving our annual execution of our People Strategy, which contributes to our business strategy and value generation. It can be summarized across three strategic priorities powered by operational excellence, and showcasing SAP SuccessFactors solutions for human experience management (HXM):\n\n- Build SAP’s Skills for the Future by attracting the best and most diverse talent and continuously up-/reskilling our people\n- Drive SAP’s Winning and Inclusive Culture by fostering a culture that enables and rewards impact and business outcomes and nurtures inclusion and belonging\n- Change the Way We Lead – Do What’s Right by driving accountability and empowerment in an agile, healthy, and inclusive environment\n\n# Due Diligence\n\n# Governance\n\nSabine Bendiek served as Chief People and Operating Officer and Labor Relations Director from January 1, 2021, until her departure from the Company on December 31, 2023.
