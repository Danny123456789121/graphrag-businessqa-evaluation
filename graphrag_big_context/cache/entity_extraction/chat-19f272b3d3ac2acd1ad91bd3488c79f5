In addition, we moved electricity consumption of co-location data centers from Scope 3 to Scope 2 due to the underlying leasing model and SAP’s operational control over the IT infrastructure.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Financial Calendar and Addresses\n\n# Financial Calendar\n\n|2024|April 22|Results for the first quarter 2024|\n|---|---|---|\n| |May 15|Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Mannheim, Germany|\n| |May 21|Dividend payment|\n| |July 22|Results for the second quarter and half-year 2024|\n| |October 21|Results for the third quarter 2024|\n\n# Addresses\n\nGroup Headquarters\n\nSAP SE\n\nDietmar-Hopp-Allee 16\n\n69190 Walldorf\n\nGermany\n\nTel. +49 6227 74 74 74\n\nFax +49 6227 75 75 75\n\nE-mail info@sap.com\n\nWeb site www.sap.com\n\nThe addresses of all our international subsidiaries and sales partners are available on our public Web site at www.sap.com/directory/main.html.\n\nFor more information about the matters discussed in the report, contact:\n\n# Investor Relations\n\nTel. +49 6227 76 73 36\n\nFax +49 6227 74 08 05\n\nE-mail investor@sap.com\n\nWeb site www.sap.com/investor\n\n# Press\n\nTel. +49 6227 74 63 15\n\nE-mail press@sap.com\n\nWeb site www.sap.com/press\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
