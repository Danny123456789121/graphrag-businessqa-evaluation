These standards enable the continuous operation of global systems, ensuring 24/7 observations, data exchange, management, forecasting, and the delivery of authoritative scientific assessments and standardized services.\n\n# Create data catalogs across priority sectors for all climate-relevant data categories (for example, weather, water, agriculture, energy use, and socioeconomic factors).\n\n# Examples:\n\n- The World Meteorological Organization has not only published a set of data standards but also a Catalogue for Climate Data, a curated listing of global, regional, and national data sets of climate-related data that meet its standards for data quality and stewardship.\n- Climate Change AI, a nonprofit, has published the CCAI Dataset Wishlist that enumerates currently unavailable data that could accelerate AI-driven climate progress. It classifies desirable data by topic as well as by its current state of availability (for example, public data needing structure, private data needing release, scattered data needing collation, and scarce data needing collection).\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE 30\n\n# Ensure Technology Access and Affordability\n\nWithout devices collecting data from the real world (for example, sensors, drones, and satellites)—and without connectivity (for example, fiber and 5G) and computing infrastructure (for example, cloud data centers)—AI algorithms are powerless. Consider an application such as AI-driven smart irrigation. Field sensors need broadband to send data to servers and storage devices in the cloud. The servers then process the data, comparing it with insights from a training set, and formulate recommendations that need to be communicated back to the irrigation system in the field.\n\nThis critical technology infrastructure, while widely available in the developed world, is not currently accessible in many less-developed regions, particularly the Global South. Affordability is also a concern. For example, customers in less-developed countries pay 6% of per capita gross national income for mobile broadband service, while those in high-income countries pay just 0.4%.47\n\n# Leaders could:\n\n# Build private-public partnerships to ensure affordable access and deploy locally or regionally critical AI technology infrastructure (for example, cloud data centers, satellites).\n\nExamples:\n\n- Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is partnering with Sakura Internet to expand Japan’s computational capacity. It is providing half of the needed investment to build an AI supercomputer, aiming to accelerate AI development and implementation in Japan.\n- The European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking—a €7 billion initiative over 2021–2027 to build petascale and pre-exascale supercomputing infrastructure in Europe—aspires to accelerate European innovation by expanding access to state-of-the-art tools.\n- The US Community Infrastructure for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CIRC) program seeks to increase researcher access to critical technology infrastructure by funding the development and improvement of top-tier research infrastructure.\n\n# Empower the private sector to build and/or expand AI technology infrastructure.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Norway’s data center strategy, introduced in 2018, features public investments in fiber infrastructure as well as tax incentives (such as property tax reductions) aimed at attracting data center operators and ensuring the accessibility of computing infrastructure.\n- The South African government aims to launch a National Cloud and Data Policy. This initiative—currently under consultation—seeks to provide policy certainty for investments in data centers and cloud services and to reinforce South Africa’s leading position in Africa. The draft policy includes provisions for establishing a Special Economic Zone for Digital and ICT, as well as policies addressing data protection, data localization, and cross-border data transfers.\n\n# Support R&D for AI technology infrastructure across the public sector, private sector, and academia.\n\nExamples:\n\n- The US Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program is a federally funded R&D initiative focused on advanced IT, covering computing, networking, and software nationwide. Its 25 member agencies invest about $9.6 billion annually in various R&D programs, including high-capability computing systems, advanced communication networks and systems, and more.\n- The Quantum Technologies Flagship is a 10-year, €1 billion EU initiative that aims to advance Europe’s leadership in quantum technologies by bridging research with practical applications. It brings together research institutions, industry partners, and public funders.\n\n# Cultivate Awareness and Build Expertise\n\nPeople need to remain at the center of policy and climate action. They must be aware of AI’s potential and support its use for climate action—and people with AI skills will be needed to help address the climate challenge.\n\nIt is important to build awareness among all stakeholders—policymakers, corporate decision-makers, civil servants, and the broader public—of AI’s potential contributions to climate solutions as well as of its risks. With awareness of the challenges, of key achievements, and of best practice comes support for AI-enabled climate action.\n\nTranslating that support into climate progress will require, in addition to more AI computing infrastructure, more talent. Without technical experts such as data scientists—and domain experts such as climatologists and climate economists—it will be impossible to develop, deploy, and govern climate-related AI applications. In a recent BCG survey, 78% of business leaders with responsibility for climate, AI, or both cited insufficient access to qualified talent as a barrier to using AI to address their climate-related challenges. And critical talent is not only in short supply, but also heavily concentrated in the developed world. According to the OECD’s AI Policy Observatory, North America is home to 30% of the world’s data scientists and machine learning experts, while sub-Saharan Africa hosts under 2%.\n\n# Leaders could:\n\nEstablish AI and climate training and literacy programs for policymakers and the broader public sector workforce.\n\n# Examples of AI-related trainings:\n\n- Government AI Campus, created by Google.org and the Rockefeller Foundation, is an online career-development initiative for government staff that prepares them to lead in the age of AI.\n- AI4Gov—a European
