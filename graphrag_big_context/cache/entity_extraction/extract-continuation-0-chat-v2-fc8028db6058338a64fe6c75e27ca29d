The technical potential curve is quite steep because of the acceleration in generative AI’s natural-language capabilities (Exhibit 7).\n\n# Exhibit 7\n\nThe advent of generative AI has pulled forward the potential for technical automation.\n\n# Technical automation potentials by scenario, %\n\n100Updated early scenario including generative AIUpdated late scenario90including generative AI2017 early scenario2017 late scenario80Time spent on current work activities70605020202030204020502060\n\n1 Includes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world. 2017 estimates are based on the activity and occupation mix from 2016. Scenarios including generative AI are based on the 2021 activity and occupation mix. Early and late scenarios reflect the ranges provided by experts (see Exhibit 6). Source: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nAdoption lags behind technical automation potential. Our analysis of adoption scenarios accounts for the time required to integrate technological capabilities into solutions that can automate individual work activities; the cost of these technologies compared with that of human labor in different occupations and countries around the world; and the time it has taken for technologies to diffuse across the economy. With the acceleration in technical automation potential that generative AI enables, our scenarios for automation adoption have correspondingly accelerated. These scenarios encompass a wide range of outcomes, given that the pace at which solutions will be developed and adopted will vary based on decisions that will be made on investments.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\ndeployment, and regulation, among other factors. But they give an indication of the degree to which the activities that workers do each day may shift.\n\nAs an example of how this might play out in a specific occupation, consider postsecondary English language and literature teachers, whose detailed work activities include preparing tests and evaluating student work. With generative AI’s enhanced natural-language capabilities, more of these activities could be done by machines, perhaps initially to create a first draft that is edited by teachers but perhaps eventually with far less human editing required. This could free up time for these teachers to spend more time on other work activities, such as guiding class discussions or tutoring students who need extra assistance.\n\nOur previously\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that analyzes economic trends and the impact of technology on labor markets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that provides insights and analysis on various industries and economic factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can generate text, images, and other content, significantly impacting productivity and automation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTSECONDARY ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE TEACHERS<|>PERSON<|>Postsecondary English language and literature teachers are educators who teach courses in English language and literature at colleges and universities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>McKinsey Global Institute is a part of McKinsey & Company, focusing on research and analysis of economic trends<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>McKinsey Global Institute analyzes the impact of generative AI on labor markets and productivity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>POSTSECONDARY ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE TEACHERS<|>Generative AI has the potential to automate tasks performed by postsecondary English language and literature teachers<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
