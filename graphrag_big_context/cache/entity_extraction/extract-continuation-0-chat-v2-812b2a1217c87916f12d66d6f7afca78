Combining generative AI with all other technologies, work automation could add 0.5 to 3.4 percentage points annually to productivity growth. However, workers will need support in learning new skills, and some will change occupations. If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.\n\n# 7.\n\nThe era of generative AI is just beginning. Excitement over this technology is palpable, and early pilots are compelling. But a full realization of the technology’s benefits will take time, and leaders in business and society still have considerable challenges to address. These include managing the risks inherent in generative AI, determining what new skills and capabilities the workforce will need, and rethinking core business processes such as retraining and developing new skills.\n\n# Generative AI as a technology catalyst\n\nTo grasp what lies ahead requires an understanding of the breakthroughs that have enabled the rise of generative AI, which were decades in the making. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable Diffusion, and other generative AI tools that have captured current public attention are the result of significant levels of investment in recent years that have helped advance machine learning and deep learning. This investment undergirds the AI applications embedded in many of the products and services we use every day.\n\nBut because AI has permeated our lives incrementally—through everything from the tech powering our smartphones to autonomous-driving features on cars to the tools retailers use to surprise and delight consumers—its progress was almost imperceptible. Clear milestones, such as when AlphaGo, an AI-based program developed by DeepMind, defeated a world champion Go player in 2016, were celebrated but then quickly faded from the public’s consciousness.\n\nChatGPT and its competitors have captured the imagination of people around the world in a way AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to communicate and create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. The latest generative AI applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the reorganization and classification of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own. As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# How did we get here? Gradually, then all of a sudden\n\nFor the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using foundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the billions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called deep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep learning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering generative AI applications are a step change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous deep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and perform more than one task.\n\nFoundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across a broad range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. AI trained on these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer questions, and draft new content, among other tasks.\n\nContinued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power required to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a bottleneck in development. Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-source community and spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to make AI more responsible, which could increase its costs.\n\nNonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial intelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five months of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative AI increased by an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. During the same period, investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 percent, albeit from a higher base.\n\nThe rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have developed. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released a new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities. Similarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 tokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—compared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023. And in May 2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search Generative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among other Google products.\n\nFrom a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from tech giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the continent’s current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related companies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting for 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.\n\nGenerative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how knowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. Across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development, it is poised to transform roles\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can generate text, images, music, and other content, significantly impacting productivity and economic growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a generative AI application developed by OpenAI that allows users to communicate and create content through conversational interfaces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization that developed ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>EVENT<|>GPT-4 is a large language model released by OpenAI in March 2023, known for its improved capabilities over previous models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAUDE<|>EVENT<|>Claude is a generative AI model developed by Anthropic, capable of processing large amounts of text quickly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a technology company that has integrated generative AI features into its products, including the Bard chatbot.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>GEO<|>North America is a region where significant investment in generative AI is concentrated, particularly from tech giants and venture capital firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENTURE CAPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Venture capital refers to private equity investment that supports startups and small businesses, including those in the generative AI sector.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENAI<|>CHATGPT<|>OpenAI developed ChatGPT, a leading generative AI application that has gained widespread attention<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENAI<|>GPT-4<|>OpenAI released GPT-4, a significant advancement in generative AI technology<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLAUDE<|>OPENAI<|>Claude is a competing generative AI model developed by Anthropic, which is part of the broader generative AI landscape that includes OpenAI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Google has integrated generative AI technologies into its products, showcasing its relevance in the field<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>VENTURE CAPITAL<|>Venture capital investment in North America is a major driver of growth in the generative AI sector<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>VENTURE CAPITAL<|>Generative AI has attracted significant venture capital investment, indicating its economic potential<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
