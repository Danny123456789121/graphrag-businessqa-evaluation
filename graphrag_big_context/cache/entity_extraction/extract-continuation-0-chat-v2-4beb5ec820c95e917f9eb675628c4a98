In many cases, inclusion of our non-IFRS measures may facilitate comparison with our competitors’ corresponding non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures.\n\n# Limitations of Non-IFRS Measures\n\nWithout being analyzed in conjunction with the corresponding IFRS measures, the non-IFRS measures are not indicative of our present and future performance primarily for the following reasons:\n\n- While our profit (non-IFRS) numbers reflect the elimination of certain acquisition-related expenses, no eliminations are made for the additional revenue or other income that results from the acquisitions.\n- The acquisition-related amortization expense that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers is a recurring expense that will impact our financial performance in future years.\n- The remaining acquisition-related charges that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are likely to recur should SAP enter into business combinations in the future. Similarly, the restructuring expenses that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are likely to recur should SAP perform restructurings in the future.\n- The expense adjustment for acquisition-related charges does not arise from a common conceptual basis. This is because the expense adjustment aims to improve the comparability between post-acquisition periods and pre-acquisition periods. This should particularly be considered when evaluating our operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) numbers, as these combine our revenue and expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common conceptual basis.\n- Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash outflows in the past and could do so in the future.\n- In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards to our employees every year and we intend to continue doing so in the future. Thus, our share-based payment expenses are recurring, although the amounts usually change from period to period.\n- Expenses ascribed to the regulatory compliance matters may include penalties and legal costs, all of which would impact the operating cash flows of the business.\n\nWe believe that constant currency measures have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated constitute a significant element of our revenue and expenses and could materially\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nimpact our performance. Therefore, we limit our use of constant currency measures to the analysis of changes in volume as one element of the full change in a financial measure. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering operating profit (non-IFRS) at both nominal and constant currencies on the one hand, and changes in operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS on the other. We caution the readers of our financial reports to follow a similar approach by considering actual and constant currency non-IFRS measures only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, changes in revenue, operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\nDespite these limitations, we believe that the presentation of our non-IFRS measures and the corresponding IFRS measures, together with the relevant reconciliations, provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n# Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial Measures for 2023 and 2022\n\n# Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Revenue\n\n|€ millions, unless otherwise stated|IFRS|Currency Impact|Constant Currency|IFRS|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Revenue Numbers| | | | |\n|Cloud|13,664|394|14,058|11,426|\n|Software licenses|1,764|37|1,801|2,056|\n|Software support|11,496|286|11,782|11,909|\n|Software licenses and support|13,261|323|13,584|13,965|\n|Cloud and software|26,924|717|27,641|25,391|\n|Services|4,283|109|4,392|4,128|\n|Total revenue|31,207|826|32,033|29,520|\n\n# Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Operating Expenses\n\n|€ millions, unless otherwise stated|IFRS|Adj.|Non-IFRS|Currency Impact|Constant|IFRS|Adj.|Non-IFRS|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Operating Expense Numbers| | | | | | | | |\n|Cost of cloud|–3,884|135|–3,749| | |–3,499|108|–3,391|\n|Cost of software licenses and support|–1,383|64|–1,318| | |–1,384|82|–1,302|\n|Cost of cloud and software|–5,267|200|–5,067| | |–4,883|190|–4,694|\n|Cost of services|–3,407|378|–3,029| | |–3,155|250|–2,904|\n|Total cost of revenue|–8,674|577|–8,096| | |–8,038|440|–7,598|\n|Gross profit|22,534|577|23,111| | |21,482|440|21,922|\n|Research and development|–6,324|711|–5,613| | |–6,080|451|–5,629|\n|Sales and marketing|–8,828|1,246|–7,581| | |–7,946\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a software company that provides enterprise software solutions and is known for its non-IFRS financial measures and performance analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>SAP<|>SAP is the organization being discussed in the context of its financial performance and reporting measures<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
