EGC was significantly negatively correlated with GSV, GPPO, and EEP, whereas the other constructs were significantly positively correlated.\n\n**Table 2.

All the loadings were significant and exhibited suitable values in the measurement mode. The Cronbach’s α can be used as an index for determining the reliability (the standard value is 0.7) [85]. We verified the Cronbach’s α values according to the recommendations of researchers such as Williams and Hazer [86] and Anderson and Gerbing [87]. The Cronbach’s α values of all the constructs were more than 0.7, as presented in Table 4. Therefore, the measurement reliability is consistent with an acceptable standard value.\n\nAccording to Fornell and Larcker [88], when the square root of the average variation extracted (AVE) of the facet is greater than the correlation coefficient of the model facet, it means that each variable has discriminative validity, as shown in Table 2. The AVE square roots of the models GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP in this study are greater than the correlation coefficient of all the constructs. Thus, sufficient discriminant validity existed between any two constructs in this research.\n\n# Table 3.
