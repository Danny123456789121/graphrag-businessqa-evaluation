As a company operating in numerous countries across the globe, SAP is required to adhere to strict international legislation that defines acceptable business conduct and practices.\n\nAt SAP, we also expect our business practices to not only meet international rules and legal requirements, but to adhere to our internal high standards of ethics and integrity. We understand that our customers expect this as well. SAP’s reputation for doing business the right way is one of our most important assets. By striving to make ethical choices and acting with integrity, we aim to continue to grow SAP in a way that meets both our own and our customers’ high ethical expectations.\n\n# Due Diligence\n\n# Governance\n\nThe Office of Ethics & Compliance (OEC) contributes to SAP’s success by providing trusted advice to SAP managers, leaders, and employees across the entire business. The OEC strives to advance SAP’s business goals by promoting a strong culture of integrity and helping SAP to “Win the Right Way.”\n\nIn 2023, our aim to maintain a robust compliance program, based on our corporate values and voluntary commitments, as well as international standards, continued. The OEC team grew for the sixth consecutive year, from 154 employees in 2022 to 157 employees in 2023. The group chief compliance officer (GCCO) continues to report directly to the group CEO.\n\nAt SAP, ethical behavior is an integral part of our cultural values that can influence our daily decision-making at every level of the business and in every market. To help nurture this environment, the OEC’s various teams continually provide guidance to SAP colleagues, address compliance challenges, and improve policies, guidelines, systems, and measures related to their implementation.\n\nThe OEC has field compliance officers across the globe, in both high- and low-risk jurisdictions. Field compliance officers are often the first point of contact for the business when compliance matters arise. In those high-risk countries in which the OEC is not physically represented and where there might be local language needs, the OEC operates a network of compliance stewards drawn largely from either our legal, finance, or human resources (HR) departments. Compliance stewards support the OEC’s field compliance officers by offering advice on specific and straightforward compliance questions; they work alongside our global network of compliance ambassadors (drawn from all areas of the Company) to amplify compliance messages and provide a further link for local employees to the relevant field compliance officer.\n\nCompliance matters are regularly discussed with Executive and Supervisory Board members at quarterly Audit and Compliance Committee meetings as well as during regular touchpoints with Executive Board and Supervisory Board members. Compliance matters are also discussed by the GCCO in quarterly Global Compliance Governance Committee meetings. Participants at these meetings include members of Global Finance, Customer Success, Global Communications, Global Security, and Global Risks & Assurance Services (GR&AS).\n\nOutside SAP, the OEC regularly exchanges ideas and best practices for compliance processes with relevant peers in the software industry and beyond. SAP is a Corporate Member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), and the GCCO is also a member of the European Chief Compliance Officers Forum (ECCIOF) and the UN Global Compact’s Think Lab focused on transformational governance.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Guidelines and Policies\n\nSAP’s Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (CoEBC) is the primary ethical and legal framework within which SAP conducts business and remains on course for success. It is available in 22 languages and is just one of many global policies that provide clear guidance to employees. SAP also expects all partners and suppliers to commit to meeting our high standards of integrity. For this reason, we have the SAP Partner Code of Conduct and the SAP Supplier Code of Conduct in place so that partners and suppliers understand what is expected of them.\n\n# How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\n# Enforcing Policies and Guidelines\n\nAll employees are bound by the CoEBC; they are required to acknowledge its contents and confirm their commitment to it on an annual basis. In 2023, we continued to monitor employee certification of the CoEBC for employees worldwide, recording a 99.9% certification rate for permanent SAP employees (excluding those from acquired companies).\n\n# Communication\n\nThe OEC’s dedicated communications team consistently distributes integrity-related communications at all levels of the Company – including to senior leaders, managers, and employees, as well as topic-related content for SAP partners. Executive Board members and senior leaders regularly host global employee meetings as well as leadership team meetings and smaller gatherings, which include integrity-focused topics, demonstrating their dedication to ethical business. Quarterly OEC newsletters provide all SAP employees with information on a range of compliance-related topics. Additionally, a quarterly newsletter with a focus on leadership and management topics is sent specifically to executive and senior management. Quarterly toolkits provide topic-focused resources to communicators across the Company to further amplify compliance messages in business-owned channels. Employees can use the SAP One employee portal at any time to access all global policies, guidelines, and additional information. Externally, our Web site sap.com features information and guidance for our external stakeholders.\n\nAll Board areas have re-committed their support for the OEC’s Compliance Ambassador Program and have nominated employees to participate in it. In 2023, a sixth cohort was introduced, bringing the number of nominees from over 1,200 in 2022 to over 1,500 in 2023. The program is designed to give employees a further point of contact in the business when compliance matters arise. Ambassadors participate in an extensive curriculum of monthly on-boarding sessions over a 15-month period. They are invited to cascade and transfer information on the importance of compliance and ethics throughout their teams and lines of business. In 2023, the Extended Compliance Ambassador Network was\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
