In our opinion, SAP SE maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\n# Executive Board’s and Supervisory Board’s Responsibility for the Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing SAP SE’s internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility for the Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on SAP SE’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n\nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# REPORT ON THE ASSURANCE ON THE ELECTRONIC RENDERING OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT, PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 317 (3A) HGB\n\n# Assurance Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined group management report (hereinafter the “ESEF documents”) contained in the electronic file “sap-2023-12-31-DE.zip” and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format (“ESEF format”).
