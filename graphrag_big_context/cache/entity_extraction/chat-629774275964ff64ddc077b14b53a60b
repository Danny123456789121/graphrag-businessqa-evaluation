The increase is mainly due to new purchase obligations related to cloud infrastructure services.

Our capital management is based on a high equity ratio, modest financial leverage, a well-balanced maturity profile, and deep debt capacity.\n\n# (E.1) Capital Structure Management\n\nThe primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and customer confidence, and to support the growth of our business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will allow us to continuously cover our funding requirements through the capital markets on reasonable terms and, in so doing, ensure a high level of independence, confidence, and financial flexibility.\n\nSAP’s prime principle of financial risk management is to safeguard liquidity at a level to be able to meet all our financial obligations. In order to support this goal, SAP’s principal use of cash is focused on:\n\n- Capital expenditure\n- Quick repayment of financial debt\n- Acquisitions and venture activities\n- Payment of dividends\n- Share buy-backs to return excess cash to shareholders\n\nSAP SE’s long-term credit rating is “A2” by Moody’s (positive outlook) and “A+” by S&P Global Ratings (stable outlook).\n\n| |12/31/2023| |12/31/2022| |∆ in %|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|€ millions|% of Total Equity|€ millions|% of Total Equity| | |\n|Equity|43,406|64|42,848|59|1|\n|Current liabilities|14,642|21|17,453|24|–16|\n|Non-current liabilities|10,287|15|11,858|16|–13|\n|Liabilities|24,928|36|29,311|41|–15|\n|Thereof financial debt|7,755|11|11,764|16|–34|\n|Thereof lease liabilities|1,621|2|2,140|3|–25|\n|Total equity and liabilities|68,335|100|72,159|100|–5|\n\nAt maturity, we repaid €1,600 million in Eurobonds, €1,450 million in term loans, and €930 million in Commercial Paper in 2023.
