Used with permission.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Reduction and Removal\n\nAI has the potential to aid organizations in reducing and removing emissions in two ways: enabling emissions reduction and supporting nature-based and technology-based carbon removal.\n\n# Enabling Emissions Reduction\n\nAI can contribute to the creation of more efficient and cleaner energy systems in multiple ways. It can, by consolidating information from dozens of different organizations and grid components, provide insights on how to optimize electric grid operations—and support informed decision-making on grid planning. It can also help speed transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources through better supply and demand forecasts that reduce the need for battery storage and standby power and enable more efficient real-time balancing of electric grids.\n\nFor example, Tapestry, an Alphabet project, is creating a single virtualized view of the electricity system with the goal of lowering emissions, minimizing outages, shortening interconnection queues, and integrating more renewables into the grid. AI is at the heart of its computational and simulation tools. Relatedly, on the subject of renewables, France’s Engie has partnered with Google Cloud to develop and pilot an AI-powered tool that can provide grid operators with more accurate real-time forecasts of wind energy supplies.9\n\nIn Africa and India, Husk Power Systems provides “pay-as-you-go” 100% renewable power to off-grid and weak-grid communities that is 30% cheaper than the alternative: diesel generation. Husk estimates that its AI model enables it to predict user demand with 80% accuracy across its microgrids, thereby improving capacity utilization, reducing costs, delivering lower prices, and guiding capital investment in additional capacity.\n\nMoreover, AI-driven insights can also enable people and organizations to make smarter decisions that decrease emissions. For instance, as a result of using AI to improve demand forecasting, manufacturers can avoid both overproduction and the emissions those unsold goods would produce. Similarly, AI-optimized transportation can reduce emissions by identifying and directing drivers to the most efficient routes. As of September 2023, Google Maps’ fuel-efficient routing feature was estimated to have helped prevent more than 2.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions since its launch in October 2021—equivalent to taking approximately 500,000 fuel-based cars off the road for an entire year.10\n\nAnd between 2011 and 2022, Google’s Nest thermostats are estimated to have helped customers cumulatively save 113 billion kWh of energy—the rough equivalent of double Portugal’s annual electricity use—by proposing thermostat adjustments based on customer behavior, such as automatically adjusting temperatures when customers are away from home.11\n\nIn the realm of agriculture, the integration of AI tools with technologies such as drones can help farmers monitor their crops in real time for better field management, thus enhancing agricultural productivity while minimizing GHG emissions. Moreover, AI-driven precision farming helps empower farmers to make well-informed, data-driven decisions regarding farming practices, crop selection, irrigation, fertilizing, pest management, and harvesting. This approach streamlines resource utilization and, if done purposefully, can minimize the environmental impact associated with farming practices. For example, Alphabet’s project Mineral is using robotics, AI, and computer vision to create a more sustainable food production system. It is developing perception-powered solutions with partners across the agriculture value chain—from grocery retailers and enterprise farms to equipment manufacturers and crop protection companies—to develop a better understanding of the complex interactions of plants, their growing environments, and farm management practices.12\n\nAnother interesting use case involves using AI to reduce contrails. Contrails, the white clouds that sometimes form behind airplanes when they fly, are responsible for about 35% of the aviation sectors’ global warming impact. AI solutions developed by Google Research in partnership with Breakthrough Energy have enabled airline pilots in trial studies to reduce contrails by up to 54%.13 (See the sidebar The Contrails Impact Task Force: Addressing Aviation’s Other Contribution to Warming.)\n\n# Supporting Nature-Based and Technology-Based Removal\n\nAccording to the IPCC, limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100 will require an extensive deployment of CO2 removal measures, of which there are two broad types: nature-based removal in which carbon is removed by and stored in natural sinks such as forests, algae, and wetlands, and technology-based removal via approaches such as direct air capture (DAC).14 AI can play a supporting role in both types of removal.\n\nIn nature-based removal, AI-based solutions can help quantify and verify the level of carbon sequestration achieved in an ecosystem, enabling public and private sector leaders to make informed decisions regarding the deployment of natural solutions, including land management and reforestation efforts. One actor in this space is Albo Climate. Using myriad remote sensing imagery and proprietary AI algorithms, Albo Climate monitors and quantifies environmental metrics such as above- and below-ground carbon sequestration and land-use dynamics in forestry and agricultural ecosystems and provides transparent and reliable data to various stakeholders of the nature-based markets.\n\n# The Contrails Impact Task Force: Addressing Aviation’s Other Contribution to Warming\n\nAviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. According to the IPCC, contrails—the thin, white lines you sometimes see behind flying aircraft—account for roughly 35% of aviation’s global warming impact.\n\nContrails are created in certain atmospheric conditions that enable water droplets to condense and freeze around the soot particles from jet engine exhaust. Some dissipate quickly, while others form into persistent contrail-cirrus clouds that can last for hours, trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space.\n\nTo mitigate this, Google Research teamed up with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to combine AI\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston Consulting Group is a global management consulting firm that advises on business strategy and operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products, including search engines, cloud computing, and AI technologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAPESTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tapestry is an Alphabet project focused on creating a virtualized view of the electricity system to lower emissions and improve grid operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGIE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Engie is a French multinational utility company that focuses on electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, and renewable energy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUSK POWER SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Husk Power Systems provides renewable energy solutions to off-grid communities in Africa and India, utilizing AI for demand prediction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Cloud is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>EVENT<|>AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can optimize processes, reduce emissions, and enhance decision-making across various sectors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBO CLIMATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Albo Climate is a company that uses AI and remote sensing to monitor and quantify carbon sequestration in ecosystems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAKTHROUGH ENERGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Breakthrough Energy is an organization focused on advancing sustainable energy solutions and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTRAILS IMPACT TASK FORCE<|>EVENT<|>The Contrails Impact Task Force is an initiative aimed at addressing the aviation sector's contribution to global warming through contrail reduction.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Google Cloud is a service provided by Google, utilizing its infrastructure for cloud computing solutions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAPESTRY<|>GOOGLE<|>Tapestry is an Alphabet project, indicating a direct relationship with Google as its parent company<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENGIE<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Engie partnered with Google Cloud to develop an AI-powered tool for grid operators<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUSK POWER SYSTEMS<|>AI<|>Husk Power Systems utilizes AI to predict user demand for renewable energy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBO CLIMATE<|>AI<|>Albo Climate employs AI to monitor and quantify carbon sequestration<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAKTHROUGH ENERGY<|>GOOGLE<|>Breakthrough Energy collaborates with Google Research to reduce contrails in aviation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTRAILS IMPACT TASK FORCE<|>BREAKTHROUGH ENERGY<|>The Contrails Impact Task Force is an initiative that involves Breakthrough Energy in its efforts to mitigate aviation's warming impact<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
