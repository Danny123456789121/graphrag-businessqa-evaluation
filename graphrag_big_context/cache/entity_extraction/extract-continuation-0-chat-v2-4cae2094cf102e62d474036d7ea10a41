Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a combined non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section “Sustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures” of the combined non-financial statement. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n# Independence and Quality Assurance of the Assurance Practitioner’s Firm\n\nWe have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements - in particular the By-laws Regulating the Rights and Duties of Wirtschaftsprüfer and vereidigte Buchprüfer in the exercise of their Profession and the Standards on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW), and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nthat includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n# Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the combined non-financial statement based on our assurance engagement. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" issued by the IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the combined non-financial financial statement for the period of January 1 to December 31, 2023, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section “Sustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures” of the combined non-financial statement.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance practitioner.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gain an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the management and relevant employees responsible for the materiality\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP SE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP SE is a multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKFURT AM MAIN<|>GEO<|>Frankfurt am Main is a major financial hub in Germany and the location of the German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
