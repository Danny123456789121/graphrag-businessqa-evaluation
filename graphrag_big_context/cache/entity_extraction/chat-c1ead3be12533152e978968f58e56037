Further, it contains information about financial instruments.\n\n# (F.1) Financial Risk Factors and Risk Management\n\n# Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nWe use derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk or interest rate risk and designate them as cash flow or fair value hedges if they qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9, which involves judgment.\n\n# Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments in Hedge Accounting Relationships\n\nMany transactions constitute economic hedges, and therefore contribute effectively to the securing of financial risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. To hedge currency risks inherent in foreign-currency denominated and recognized monetary assets and liabilities, we do not designate our held-for-trading derivative financial instruments in hedge accounting, because the profits and losses from the underlying transactions are recognized in profit or loss in the same periods as the profits or losses from the derivatives.\n\nIn addition, we occasionally have contracts that contain foreign currency embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately.\n\nFair value fluctuations in the spot component of such derivatives at FVTPL are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net while the forward element is shown in Financial income, net.\n\n# Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\n# a) Cash Flow Hedge\n\nIn general, we apply cash flow hedge accounting to the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecasted transactions. With regard to foreign currency risk, hedge accounting relates to the spot price and to the intrinsic values of the derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges.\n\nAccordingly, the effective portion of these components determined on a present value basis is recorded in other comprehensive income. The forward element and time value as well as foreign currency basis spreads excluded from the hedging relationship are recorded as cost of hedging in a separate position in other comprehensive income. As the amounts are not material, they are presented together with the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity. All other components including counterparty credit risk adjustments of the derivative and the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other non-operating income/expense, net and Financial income, net in the same period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\n# b) Net Investment Hedge\n\nIn general, we do not hedge the foreign currency exposure from the net assets of subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the euro, and we do not apply net investment hedge accounting. However, in selected cases we might do so, and we applied net investment hedge accounting in 2023. For more information, see Note (D.1).\n\nThe designated component in hedge accounting is the spot price of the derivatives designated and qualifying as net investment hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of this component determined on a present value basis is recorded in Other comprehensive income. All other not-designated components or ineffective portions are immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in Other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# non-operating income/expense, net in the same period when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\n# c) Fair Value Hedge\n\nWe apply fair value hedge accounting for certain of our fixed-rate financial liabilities and show the fair value fluctuations in Financial income, net.\n\n# d) Valuation and Testing of Effectiveness\n\nAt inception of a designated hedging relationship, we document our risk management strategy and the economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is demonstrated as well as the effectiveness of the hedging relationship tested prospectively by applying the critical terms match for our foreign currency hedges, since currencies, maturities, and the amounts are closely aligned for the forecasted transactions and for the spot element of the forward exchange rate contract or intrinsic value of the currency options, respectively. For interest rate swaps, effectiveness is tested prospectively using statistical methods in the form of a regression analysis, by which the validity and extent of the relationship between the change in value of the hedged items as the independent variable and the fair value change of the derivatives as the dependent variable is determined. The main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- The effect of the counterparty and our own credit risk on the fair value of the forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which is not reflected in the respective hedged item, and\n- Differences in the timing of hedged item and hedged transaction in our cash flow hedges.\n\nWe are exposed to various financial risks, such as market risks (that is, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. We manage market risks, credit risk, and liquidity risk on a Group-wide basis through our global treasury department, global risk management, and global credit management. Risk management policies are established to identify risks, to set appropriate risk limits, and to monitor risks. Risk management policies and hedging strategies are laid out in our internal guidelines (for example, treasury guideline and other internal guidelines), and are subject to continuous internal review, analysis, and update to reflect changes in market conditions and our business. We only purchase derivative financial instruments to reduce risks and not for speculation, which is defined as entering into derivative instruments without a corresponding underlying transaction.\n\n# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\n# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Factors\n\nAs we are active worldwide, our ordinary operations are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies. Since the Group’s entities mainly conduct their operating business in their own functional currencies, our risk of exchange rate fluctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not considered significant.
