If attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities before patches are installed or mitigating measures are implemented, significant compromises could impact our and our customersâ€™ systems and data.\n\nWe could also experience material exposure to our business operations and service delivery due to disruptions to backups, disaster recovery or business-continuity management processes, or as the result of malicious or inadvertent actions by threat actors, employees, contractors, or a host of other parties. Security threats may also exist due to delayed or insufficient responses to identified issues or other interdependencies such as cloud service providers and those beyond SAPâ€™s cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols. SAPâ€™s and/or its partnersâ€™ lack of sufficient security controls or compliance with existing controls could impact SAPâ€™s and/or its partnersâ€™ ability to comply with applicable regulations and customer requirements. SAP and/or its partners could unknowingly introduce security threats and vulnerabilities without established security evaluation processes. Additionally, failure to integrate or maintain SAPâ€™s cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols with network systems obtained through acquisitions could result in cyberbreaches, a loss of data confidentiality and integrity, and/or a loss of system availability.\n\nThe foregoing types of events could result in a loss of customers or customer opportunities, a diminished reputation in the marketplace, government investigations or enforcement actions, internal investigations, litigation including class actions, fines, or penalties, increased costs associated with remediation or compliance requirements, required changes to our business model or operations, and a host of other costs and losses, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial performance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows. In response to the cybersecurity risk environment it is experiencing, SAP is continuously enhancing its\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\ncybersecurity program, for example by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and establishing a Cyber Fusion Center (CFC). In addition, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board continue to increase their governance of and involvement in cybersecurity matters, for example by focusing on cybersecurity audit and risk management topics. SAP has established measures intended to address the described risks and adverse effects, such as the continuous adaptation, standardization, and modification of our security procedures. This includes, among others: security risk identification, threat modeling, advanced threat defense, application patches and container security enhancements, and security validation of our critical components and services before shipment. We increased our investments and resources, including various internal initiatives to achieve SAPâ€™s objective of ensuring over time that our cybersecurity infrastructure meets or exceeds evolving industry standards. In addition, we enhanced the security capabilities in our hosting environment, cloud platforms, and cloud deployment tools, including improved monitoring to our infrastructure. Disaster recovery and business continuity plans are in place to protect our key IT infrastructure including implementation of data redundancies and backup strategies. In addition, we have set up local and regional crisis management teams to respond and minimize losses in case of crisis situations. Furthermore, we conduct security certifications and attestations (such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 22301, SOC, and PCI) and provide our customers with security white papers, product documentation, and reports from independent auditors and certification bodies. All employees are required to follow the SAP Global Security Policy, security standards, procedures, and good practices reinforced by completion of mandatory security and compliance training. SAPâ€™s third-party risk management process aims to control and achieve governance in SAPâ€™s third-party ecosystem. Besides conducting risk assessments to gauge a third partyâ€™s risk level, we increase employee and contractor awareness through cybersecurity campaigns and awareness training. Formalized third-party and partner data privacy and security agreements require adherence to SAP standards. We also engage experts to advise on appropriate cybersecurity protocols to further increase attention and understanding of cybersecurity procedures and protection options. SAP also established the CFC to bring functional teams together and strengthen detection capability. Additionally, the software security development lifecycle with integrated security features and functionalities has been applied to increase coordination across our various lines of business, which in turn improves our ability to detect, identify, and respond to threats in a timely manner. Despite the foregoing measures, we cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor were to occur, the impact could be business-critical and materially impact our business and results. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and classify this risk factor as high.\n\n# Technology and Products\n\nOur technology and products may experience undetected defects, coding or configuration errors, may not integrate as expected, or may not meet customer expectations. We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: failure of software products and services to fully meet market needs or customer expectations; failure of software products and services from acquired companies to fully comply with SAP quality standards; failure of new products, services, and cloud offerings, including third-party technologies, to comply with local standards and requirements; the possibility that new products, services, and cloud offerings or subsequent versions and updates to existing products, services, and cloud offerings might contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or might not be mature enough from the customerâ€™s point of view for business-critical solutions, or might not be sufficiently secure after release or shipment despite all the due diligence SAP puts into quality; inability of algorithms to correctly adapt to evolving circumstances, which may lead to adverse decision-making processes in the context of AI-related technologies; and the inability to fulfil expectations of customers regarding time and quality in the defect resolution process. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows. SAP has established measures to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such as: a broad range of techniques,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
