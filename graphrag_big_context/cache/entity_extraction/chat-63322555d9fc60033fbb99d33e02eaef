And now we’re seeing how leading companies are capturing business value from these often-dazzling AI and generative AI (gen AI) capabilities.\n\nOne of the most interesting findings in this year’s survey is that among the high performers capturing the most value from gen AI, most solutions are highly customized or bespoke (what we refer to as “shaper” or “maker” archetypes of gen AI solutions). While many companies are finding value from off-the-shelf gen AI solutions (or the “taker” archetype), capturing the full value of this technology often requires significant customization—for example, training models on proprietary company and customer data or tuning models to improve performance within a specific industry or business context.\n\nThe survey also sheds new light on high performers’ practices. High performers, for example, are significantly more likely than others to embed testing and validation in the release process for models, as well as to develop clear processes to iteratively improve model outputs. Over time, these kinds of practices will become even more important, as highly customized and bespoke solutions are the ones that will truly be differentiating for companies. Off-the-shelf solutions, by contrast, are likely to become table stakes. Collectively, these data on practices are consistent with our ongoing work and research on digital and AI transformations, which shows that competitive advantage comes from building organizational and technological capabilities to broadly innovate, deploy, and improve solutions at scale—in effect, rewiring the business for distributed digital and AI innovation.\n\n# About the Research\n\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent’s nation to global GDP.\n\nAlex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky are global coleaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and senior partners in McKinsey’s Chicago and London offices, respectively; Lareina Yee is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner, is a partner; and Bryce Hall is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.\n\nThey wish to thank Kaitlin Noe, Larry Kanter, Mallika Jhamb, and Shinjini Srivastava for their contributions to this work.\n\nDesigned by McKinsey Global Publishing\n\nCopyright © 2024 McKinsey & Company.
