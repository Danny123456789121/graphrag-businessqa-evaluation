Nonetheless, AI providers are already striving to enhance energy efficiency and integrate clean energy sources.\n\nWater Use. Water-based cooling remains the most energy-efficient option for data centers, and its overall impact on water consumption is low. In 2016 in the US, data centers were estimated to have used less than 0.02% of the country’s water consumption for cooling. Nevertheless, in some cases, water-based cooling can put pressure on local water resources. Data center operators have begun to address this issue by providing more disclosure, exploring new cooling techniques, and investing in replenishment initiatives.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n•  Waste. While data centers currently account for only a small fraction of the world’s e-waste challenge, there is an opportunity for tech firms to build on early circularity successes and take a more thoughtful approach embracing more recycling and reuse.\n\n•  Other Potential Risks. AI applications should be sustainable and equitable by intention. AI can be applied to both climate-friendly and climate-unfriendly applications, can narrow or widen disparities between the Global North and the Global South, and can be trained on data sets that reflect the world’s diversity. Leaders and model builders need to be mindful in their design choices.\n\nPolicymakers have a critical oversight role to play in maximizing the benefits from AI-driven climate action while minimizing its risks. Critical policy outcomes to pursue include the following:\n\n- Enabling AI for climate progress by encouraging data sharing, ensuring affordable technology access, building awareness, and investing in talent\n- Accelerating the deployment of AI for climate by defining public and private sector priorities, delivering on public sector use cases, and encouraging private sector action\n- Promoting environmentally and socially responsible deployment of AI\n\n# 3 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# How We Define Artificial Intelligence\n\nAccording to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI is defined as the ability of computers to imitate human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving, using math and logic to simulate the process of reasoning that helps humans learn from new information and make decisions.\n\nFor the purposes of this report, we are using a broader definition of AI that comprises a set of mathematical and computer science techniques aimed at analyzing data to help understand and navigate real-world phenomena through:\n\n- providing better information (descriptive use cases),\n- delivering improved predictions (predictive use cases), and\n- suggesting optimization moves and recommendations to reach targets (prescriptive use cases).\n\nThese goals can be attained by applying a wide range of techniques including those in the table below—all of which we include in this report’s definition of AI.\n\nApplying AI to real-world problems is common practice today. The technology has proven its ability to help public and private organizations have a better understanding of their context, provide better services, and improve their operational performance.\n\n|Technology|General Example|Climate-Related Example|\n|---|---|---|\n|Advanced Analytics|Supermarket Inventory Management. Advanced analytics can identify best sellers and demand dynamics, enabling more efficient shelving and restocking strategies, thereby reducing waste and ensuring popular items are always in stock.|Energy Consumption Optimization. Advanced analytics can optimize a building’s carbon footprint by adjusting heating, cooling, and lighting systems in response to real-time data from sensors and weather forecasts.|\n|Machine Learning|Credit Card Fraud Detection. Machine learning helps banks and credit card companies detect unusual transactions, enabling them to alert card holders and minimize fraud losses.|Predicting Wildfires. Machine learning models can analyze weather data, satellite imagery, and terrain information to predict the likelihood of wildfires, helping authorities take preventive measures and optimize resource allocation.|\n|Deep Learning|Medical Image Evaluation. Applied to the analysis of medical images such as X-rays and MRIs, deep learning helps doctors diagnose diseases and other abnormalities more accurately, enabling more timely and effective treatments.|Extreme Weather Prediction. Deep learning can analyze vast amounts of historical and real-time meteorological and satellite data, leading to more accurate forecasts for hurricanes, tornadoes, and typhoons.|\n|Large Language Models|Customer Service Chatbots. Large language models enable companies to automate the process of answering customer questions and helping troubleshoot issues, enhancing the efficiency of, and satisfaction with, customer service operations.|Green Technology Innovation. Large language models can accelerate innovation by digesting research papers and patent applications and rapidly surfacing ideas and identifying knowledge gaps.|\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# The Climate Action Imperative and the Promise of AI\n\nDespite significant progress over the last several years in mobilizing the global community to intensify its climate actions and ambitions, the world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement’s target to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. This target was selected because scientists believe that above that level, the effects would be catastrophic and potentially irreversible. At present—based on updated national pledges since COP26 in 2021—the United Nations Environment Programme currently estimates that we are on a path to warming by 2.8°C.\n\nEven if the world succeeds in limiting warming to 1.5°C, there will still be adverse impacts. Already today at 1.1°C, the IPCC reports that over 3 billion people live in areas highly vulnerable to climate impacts. We are already seeing the impact on weather, agriculture, water security, and migration. If we overshoot the target, the picture becomes increasingly dire: seas will rise further, droughts will be worse, and extreme weather events will be more common.\n\n# ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\nIn a 1.5°C world, the IPCC forecasts that 48% of the world’s population will be exposed to deadly heat levels for more than 20 days a year. In a 3° to 4°C world, that number increases to 74%.
