Scope of the investment landscape\n\nFor data on investment flows into generative AI, we relied on Pitchbook.\n\nFor data on investments in artificial intelligence overall, we referred to The AI Index 2023 annual report by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI.1\n\n# II. How we sized the use case value potential\n\n# Overall objective\n\nThe objective was to estimate the potential economic impact of generative AI and foundation models using a bottom-up assessment of the most relevant use cases across business functions and industries. The resulting analysis approximates the potential value of generative AI and foundation models in terms of productivity, or the equivalent amount by which the technologies could reduce the global functional spending required to maintain current revenue levels.\n\n# Summary of our approach\n\nOur micro-to-macro use-case-based approach to estimating the potential impact of generative AI included the following:\n\nHow we estimated the impact of generative AI across industries. We identified and cataloged generative AI and foundation model use cases with input from experts from McKinsey’s industry and functional practices. While the resulting generative AI and foundation model use case database is not necessarily exhaustive, it was meant to be as comprehensive as possible.\n\n# Business function overview\n\n|Business function|Definition|\n|---|---|\n|Customer operations|Activities related to customer care, such as call centers|\n|Software development|Activities related to designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software programs, applications, and systems, such as enterprise resource planning tools and other internal tools, that meet specific business or customer needs|\n|Product R&D|Activities related to new products or services, such as market and academic research, ideation, and simulations used in the early stages of product development, and heavy simulations, prototyping, and testing used later in the development process|\n|Legal, risk, and compliance|Activities related to risk and compliance, such as labor relations, litigation support, and contract creation|\n\n1 The AI Index 2023 annual report, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, April 2023.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Activities related to B2B and B2C marketing, for example,\n\n# Marketing and sales\n\nmarket research, creative, marketing strategy, and sales, customer preparation, and interaction support, including pricing analytical support, price scraping, and item matching\n\n# IT\n\nActivities related to internal information tech systems, such as administrative and IT help desk, but excluding software engineering for internal solutions (captured within software engineering)\n\n# Talent and organization (including HR)\n\nActivities related to organizational performance and talent management;
