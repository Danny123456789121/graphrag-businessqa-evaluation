The joint meetings with the Technology and Strategy Committee in April and October focused on SAP’s cybersecurity framework, which had been enhanced based on the results of the assessment by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, a department of the U.S. Department of Commerce). Beyond this, the Committees reviewed the status of the SOC certifications for fiscal 2023, and the Audit and Compliance Committee approved the certification services to be provided by BDO. The auditor attended the Audit and Compliance Committee meetings except for the joint meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee and the Technology and Strategy Committee, and reported in depth on its audit work and on its quarterly reviews of selected cloud and software agreements.\n\n22/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– The Finance and Investment Committee held four regular meetings and four extraordinary meetings in 2023. In addition, it held a joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in February 2023 and again in December 2023. The Committee devoted considerable time at several meetings to discussing business development and investor relations, and to discussing an analysis of management efficiency. At an extraordinary meeting in January 2023, the Committee and the Executive Board examined the different options for selling SAP’s interest in Qualtrics. In the joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in February 2023, the members of both Committees discussed the annual budget for 2023 and recommended its approval to the Supervisory Board. In the Finance and Investment Committee meeting that followed, the members were updated on the Group’s liquidity situation and on productivity in the development organization. The Committee held an extraordinary meeting in March where, after careful consideration, it resolved to recommend the divestiture of Qualtrics to the Supervisory Board. At its meeting in April, the Committee and the Executive Board discussed selected capital market topics. In addition, the Committee was updated on the investments in the venture capital area, which were being carried out in cooperation with the fund manager Sapphire Ventures, and the strategic aspects of these activities. It also reviewed SAP’s product strategy and the management of SAP’s product portfolio. In July, the Committee discussed SAP’s global strategy for the use and expansion of its data centers, as well as SAP’s sovereign cloud offerings and share-based compensation plans. Beyond this, the Executive Board reported on selected RISE with SAP contracts as well as the strategy to extend existing customer contracts, and gave the Committee members advance notice of the Company’s plans to acquire LeanIX, a provider of cloud-based IT management software. The Committee deliberated on this acquisition at length at its meeting in September, where it subsequently resolved its recommendation to the Supervisory Board. At its October meeting, the Committee discussed key treasury topics. In December 2023, the Committee held a second joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee, at which the Executive Board presented the preliminary Group annual plan for 2024. This meeting was held in preparation for the Supervisory Board meeting in February 2024, at which the full Supervisory Board resolved to approve the Group annual plan for 2024.\n\n– The Technology and Strategy Committee held six meetings in 2023, which included two joint meetings with the Audit and Compliance Committee as described above. The Committee discussed the outlook for key technology trends in the software industry in the years to come and SAP’s corporate and product strategies. At the February meeting, the Executive Board presented management’s strategy for the Customer Experience product segment – which encompasses everything an organization does to deliver superior customer outcomes – placing particular focus on customer relationship management (CRM) and SAP’s various analytics applications in this domain. In April, the Committee turned its attention to SAP’s solutions for business network growth areas, business process optimization, and sustainability. In October 2023, the Committee dealt with matters related to data integration and data management, and reviewed the Company’s innovation strategy for SAP Datasphere and the product’s generative AI capabilities. At their joint meeting in October 2023, the Finance and Investment Committee and the Technology and Strategy Committee deliberated on cybersecurity and the priorities to be set for it.\n\n– The People and Culture Committee met four times in the reporting year. At its February meeting, the Committee deliberated at length on the results of the employee survey that had been conducted in the fall of 2022, notably those relating to employee engagement, as well as feedback about management, and discussed the measures to be derived from this insight as a result. Beyond this, it focused on SAP’s training business, which had undergone a radical transformation since 2021 aimed at reaching one million active users by the end of 2023. In March, the Committee looked at the progress made in the initiative to promote a standardized performance management concept that supports the envisioned performance-based compensation and incentive system and integrated planning of annual targets for employees. In July 2023, the managers responsible for the People Compliance process at SAP introduced themselves to the Committee and, after explaining that the focus of their efforts was on preventing employee misconduct vis-à-vis others, gave an in-depth overview of the underlying compliance processes and related information. Another topic of interest at this meeting was the progress being made in strategic personnel planning. The Committee was presented in this regard with a detailed overview of the past and expected demographic development of the SAP SE workforce.\n\n23/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nand discussed the skills and expertise the Company would require of employees in the future.
