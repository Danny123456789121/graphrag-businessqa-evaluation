We will continue to vigorously defend against all claims and lawsuits against us. The provisions recorded for these claims and lawsuits as at December 31, 2023, are neither individually nor in the aggregate material to SAP.\n\n# Among the claims and lawsuits disclosed in this Note are the following classes:\n\n# Intellectual Property-Related Litigation and Claims\n\nIntellectual property-related litigation and claims are cases in which third parties have threatened or initiated litigation claiming that SAP violates one or more intellectual property rights that they possess. Such intellectual property rights may include patents, copyrights, and other similar rights.\n\nContingent liabilities exist from intellectual property-related litigation and claims for which no provision has been recognized. Generally, it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around the litigation and claims, as outlined above. Based on our past experience, most of the intellectual property-related litigation and claims tend to be either dismissed in court or settled out of court for amounts significantly below the originally claimed amounts. We currently believe that resolving the intellectual property-related claims and lawsuits pending as at December 31, 2023, will neither individually nor in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit, or cash flows.\n\nIndividual cases of intellectual property-related litigation and claims include the following:\n\nIn June 2018, Teradata Corporation, Teradata US, Inc. and Teradata Operations, Inc. (collectively “Teradata”) filed a civil lawsuit against SAP SE, SAP America, Inc., and SAP Labs, LLC in U.S. federal court in California. Teradata alleged that SAP had misappropriated trade secrets of Teradata, had infringed Teradata’s copyrights (this claim was subsequently withdrawn by Teradata), and had violated U.S. antitrust laws. Teradata sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. In 2019, SAP asserted patent infringement counterclaims against Teradata seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In 2020, Teradata initiated a second civil lawsuit against SAP asserting patent infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief; in February 2021, SAP filed patent infringement counterclaims against Teradata in this second U.S. lawsuit as well as a civil lawsuit against Teradata in Germany asserting patent infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. Currently, all claims between the parties have been dismissed. Teradata has appealed the dismissal of its trade secret and antitrust claims; this appeal is expected to be completed by late 2024.\n\n# Tax-Related Litigation\n\nWe are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. In respect of non-income taxes, we are involved in various proceedings with only a few foreign tax authorities regarding assessments and litigation matters on intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. The total potential amount in dispute related to these matters for all applicable years is approximately €416 million (2022: €344 million). We have not recorded a provision for these matters, as we believe that we will prevail.\n\nFor more information about our income tax-related litigation, see Note (C.5).\n\n238/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Anti-Bribery Matters\n\nSAP has received communications and whistleblower information alleging conduct that may violate anti-bribery laws in the United States (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)) and in other countries. SAP’s Office of Ethics & Compliance (OEC) conducted investigations with the assistance of an external law firm and voluntarily advised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC), the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), and local authorities where potential violations were investigated. In early January 2024, following comprehensive and exhaustive investigations, dialogue, and corresponding remediation activities, SAP entered into final settlement agreements with U.S. SEC and U.S. DOJ, as well as with local authorities and parties in South Africa, to resolve criminal and civil claims fully and finally against SAP. Under these agreements, SAP is required to make payments amounting to €207 million. As a consequence, as at December 31, 2023, provisions for fines in regulatory compliance matters totaling €155 million (December 31, 2022: €0 million, June 30, 2023: €170 million) were recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements as well as repayments to customers, for which revenue recognized from contracts with customers have been reversed. A considerable portion of these repayments to customers was eligible to be credited against the fines incurred in the regulatory compliance matters. Immaterial amounts were already paid in 2022. The remaining payments will be made to a large extent within the first half of 2024.\n\n# (G.4) Board of Directors\n\n# Executive Board\n\nMemberships on supervisory boards and other comparable governing bodies of enterprises, other than subsidiaries of SAP, on December 31, 2023\n\n|Name|Position|Responsibilities|Supervisory Board Membership|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Christian Klein|Chief Executive Officer|Strategy & Operations, Corporate Development, Sustainability, Business AI, and Compliance|Supervisory Board, adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, Germany|\n|Dominik Asam (from March 7, 2023)|Chief Financial Officer|Global Finance and Administration including Legal, Investor Relations, Internal Audit, Data Protection & Export Control|Supervisory Board, Bertelsmann Management SE and Bertelsmann SE & Co.
