The more a frame is rooted in an alignment logic (business case frame), the greater its focus but the lower its complexity. In contrast, the more a frame uses paradoxical thinking (paradoxical frame), the higher its complexity but the lower its focus.\n\nWe propose that these two ideal-type frames are useful heuristic devices to understand managerial decision making in a sustainability context. We now develop the consequences of each frame for the process of managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues. Exploring the consequences of the two cognitive frames provides a more comprehensive understanding of managerial cognition on ambiguities around sustainability (Walsh, 1995).\n\n# FIGURE 1\n\nRelationship Between the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame\n\n|Paradoxical frame|Paradoxical frame|\n|---|\n|Content:|Combination of economic, environmental, and social attributes|\n| |Increasing number and diversity of attributes|\n|3|Increasing complexity and diversity of interconnections between attributes|\n|Business case frame|Content:|\n|Focus on economic attributes|Low Degree of integration|\n| |High|\n\n# SENSEMAKING OF CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE BUSINESS CASE FRAME AND THE PARADOXICAL FRAME\n\nSensemaking occurs as a sequence of three core processes: scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas et al., 1993). Below we develop the differences in terms of managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues depending on whether decision makers hold a business case frame or a paradoxical frame. In the scanning phase decision makers reduce the amount and complexity of information, and, depending on the frame they hold, notice different aspects of a situation, in turn leading to differences in their information processing and interpretation of the situation. In the interpretation phase any given situation may be understood as relevant by some but perceived as irrelevant or completely overlooked by others (Barr & Huff, 1997). Assigning more or less relevance and specific meaning to the information then has consequences for the managers’ strategic response.\n\n# Scanning\n\n“Scanning involves information gathering; it usually is considered an antecedent to interpretation and action” (Thomas et al., 1993: 240). Because of their cognitive limitations, decision makers are exposed to more information than they can process (Mintzberg, 1973); hence, “executives can perceive only a selected portion of the environment” (Das & Teng, 1999: 764). Decision makers scan information according to the relevance they assign to it based on their cognitive frames (Hambrick, 1982; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Owing to the confirmatory bias of cognitive framing, they selectively notice information that conforms to their cognitive frames and ignore information that contradicts these frames (Nickerson, 1998; Palich & Bagby, 1995). They also fill gaps with frame-consistent information and tend to miss extreme or highly surprising information because it escapes their cognitive categories (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).\n\nImportant aspects of scanning refer to the depth and breadth of the information that managers collect (Beyer et al., 1997; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988) on sustainability issues (Mazutis, 2013). Information collection operates on a continuum between, at one extreme, focused search, where decision makers are looking for specific information with a clear purpose in mind, and, at the other extreme, general browsing through information, “without a particular problem to solve or question to answer” (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997: 83). Regarding the breadth of perceived aspects, Beyer and colleagues found that “the more restricted the observational goals of decision makers, the more selective their perceptions will be” (1997: 720). Similarly, the more managers attend to selected targets and previously formed hypotheses about the relationship between different aspects, the more “they might overlook information and evidence that may prove the opposite” (Das & Teng, 1999: 762). That is, a priori objectives and hypotheses selectively highlight particular cues from the organizational context (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988).\n\nThe business case frame, with its content built on economic attributes and its structure based on an alignment logic, provides managers with strong direction but, at the same time, restricts observational goals. We thus expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a rather narrow portion of the information on a sustainability issue. They will more easily absorb information they perceive as having business relevance and that is structured similar to other business information, which is very often expressed in quantitative terms (Daft & Weick, 1984). For instance, the publication of the “Stern Review” attracted managerial attention because it presented monetary estimates of the economic damage caused by climate change. Crucially, the report presented climate change as a business opportunity, stressing the benefits of early action as a way to prevent the costs of remaining inactive (Stern, 2006).\n\nDecision makers with cognitive frames of low complexity also tend to collect information from fewer selected sources (Karlins, 1967; Stabell, 1978). Accordingly, managers with a business case frame will limit their attention to sustainability-related claims of stakeholders closely related to the market environment, since these will be perceived as more powerful and relevant for business (Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997). People tend to stereotype information depending on its source (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), so decision makers with a business case frame will attend less to environmental and social issues brought forward by stakeholders having no direct impact.\n\npact on their business.
