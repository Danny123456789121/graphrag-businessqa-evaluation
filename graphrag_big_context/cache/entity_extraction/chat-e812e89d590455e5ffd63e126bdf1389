They include amounts recognized as contract liabilities and amounts that are contracted but not yet due.\n\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as at December 31, 2023, was €58.0 billion (December 31, 2022: €46.9 billion). The transaction price thereof allocated to cloud performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied (total cloud backlog) as at December 31, 2023, was €44.3 billion (December 31, 2022: €32.4 billion). The remaining amount mostly comprises obligations to provide software support services. The vast majority of software support contracts are contracts in the renewal phase that typically have a one-year contract term, while cloud subscription contracts typically are multiple-year contracts. The portion of remaining performance obligations related to services consists of non-cancelable revenue from contracts for projects with a predefined output.\n\nOverall, almost half of the total remaining performance obligations is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months following the respective balance sheet date. This estimate is based on several factors. For example, for certain cloud business models with a contractually agreed spend volume (consumption-based models), judgment is applied on customers’ deployment of the purchased solutions. The amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and changes in this amount over time, are impacted by, among others:\n\n- Currency fluctuations\n- The contract period of our cloud and software support contracts remaining at the balance sheet date, and thus the timing of contract renewals\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Performance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Years\n\nRevenue recognized in the reporting period for performance obligations satisfied in earlier periods was €78 million (December 31, 2022: €81 million), mainly resulting from changes in estimates of variable considerations and changes in estimates related to percentage-of-completion-based contracts.\n\n# Contract Balances\n\nThe following table presents the activities impacting contract liabilities balances during the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\n|Contract Liabilities|€ billions|2023|\n|---|---|---|\n|1/1/2023| |5.3|\n|Increases resulting from billing and invoices becoming due| |11.4|\n|Decreases resulting from satisfaction of performance obligations| |–11.0|\n|Other1| |–0.7|\n|12/31/2023| |5.0|\n\n1 Other includes, for example, the impact of foreign currency translation and business combinations and divestitures.\n\nThe amount of revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the reporting period was €4.5 billion (December 31, 2022: €4.1 billion).\n\n# (A.2) Trade and Other Receivables\n\n# Accounting for Trade and Other Receivables\n\nDepending on the business model, we measure trade receivables and contract assets from contracts with customers either at amortized cost, or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) less expected credit losses. We account for expected credit losses by recording an allowance on a portfolio basis. We apply the simplified impairment approach. On initial measurement of the receivables, we consider all credit losses that are expected to occur during the lifetime of the receivables. We use a provision matrix to estimate these losses.\n\nAdditionally, we recognize allowances for individual receivables if there is objective evidence of credit impairment. Account balances are written off either partially or in full if we judge that the likelihood of recovery is remote.\n\nFor information about how the default risk for trade receivables is analyzed and managed, how the loss rates for the provision matrix are determined, how credit impairment is determined and what our criteria for write-offs are, see the section on credit risk in Note (F.1).\n\nIn our Consolidated Income Statements, net gains/losses from expected credit loss allowances are included in Other operating income/expense, net. Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net.\n\nDetermining our expected credit loss allowance involves significant judgment. In this judgment, we primarily consider our historical experience with credit losses in the respective provision matrix risk class and current data on overdue receivables. We expect that our historical default rates represent a reasonable approximation for future expected customer defaults. Besides historical data, our judgment used in developing the provision matrix considers reasonable and supportable\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
