Generative AI–related companies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting for 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.\n\nGenerative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how knowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. Across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance. In the process, it could unlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors from banking to life sciences. We have used two overlapping lenses in this report to understand the potential for generative AI to create value for companies and alter the workforce. The following sections share our initial findings.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Glossary\n\nApplication programming interface (API) is a way to programmatically access (usually external) models, data sets, or other pieces of software.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are composed of interconnected layers of software-based calculators known as “neurons.” These networks can absorb vast amounts of input data and process that data through multiple layers that extract and learn the data’s features.\n\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are layers of connected “neurons” whose connections have parameters or weights that can be trained. It is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and audio.\n\nEarly and late scenarios are the extreme scenarios of our work-automation model. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.\n\nFine-tuning is the process of adapting a pretrained foundation model to perform better in a specific task. This entails a relatively short period of training on a labeled data set, which is much smaller than the data set the model was initially trained on. This additional training allows the model to learn and adapt to the nuances, terminology, and specific patterns found in the smaller data set.\n\nFoundation models (FM) are deep learning models trained on vast quantities of unstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are GPT-4, PaLM, DALL·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.\n\nGenerative AI is AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that earlier AI did not have, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also be used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or positive based on call transcripts) while offering significant improvement over earlier models. For simplicity, when we refer to generative AI in this article, we include all foundation model use cases.\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs) are computer chips that were originally developed for producing computer graphics (such as for video games) and are also useful for deep learning applications. In contrast, traditional machine learning and other analyses usually run on central processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer’s “processor.”\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) make up a class of foundation models that can process massive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions of words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing tasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and LaMDA (the model behind Bard) are examples of LLMs.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nMachine learning (ML) is a subset of AI in which a model gains capabilities after it is trained on, or shown, many example data points. Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and learn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences, rather than by receiving explicit programming instruction. The algorithms also adapt and can become more effective in response to new data and experiences.\n\nModality is a high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio.\n\nProductivity from labor is the ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy. Labor productivity growth comes from increases in the amount of capital available to each worker, the education and experience of the workforce, and improvements in technology.\n\nPrompt engineering refers to the process of designing, refining, and optimizing input prompts to guide a generative AI model toward producing desired (that is, accurate) outputs.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is a mechanism that aims to mimic cognitive attention, relating different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence.\n\nStructured data are tabular data (for example, organized in tables, databases, or spreadsheets) that can be used to train some machine learning models effectively.\n\nTransformers are a relatively new neural network architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms to transform a sequence of inputs into a sequence of outputs while focusing its attention on important parts of the context around the inputs. Transformers do not rely on convolutions or recurrent neural networks.\n\nTechnical automation potential refers to the share of the worktime that could be automated. We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. We used databases published by institutions including the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to break down about 850 occupations into approximately 2,100 activities, and we determined the performance capabilities needed for each activity based on how humans currently perform them.\n\nUse cases are targeted applications to a specific business challenge that produces one\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country that has seen significant investment in generative AI-related companies, raising about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence that can generate content and reshape knowledge work across various industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An API is a set of protocols for building and interacting with software applications, allowing access to models and data sets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior, performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANNS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ANNs are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks, used in machine learning to process data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various forms of data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOUNDATION MODELS (FM)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Foundation models are large-scale AI models trained on vast amounts of data, capable of performing a wide range of tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LLMs are a type of foundation model designed to understand and generate human language, processing large amounts of text data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING (ML)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ML is a branch of AI focused on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transformers are a neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data effectively.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The United States is a leading country in the investment and development of generative AI technologies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)<|>APIs are essential for accessing and utilizing generative AI models and data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)<|>Generative AI is a subset of AI that focuses on content generation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>FOUNDATION MODELS (FM)<|>Foundation models are the backbone of generative AI, enabling its capabilities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOUNDATION MODELS (FM)<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS)<|>LLMs are a specific type of foundation model designed for natural language processing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING (ML)<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>Deep learning is a specialized area within machine learning that uses neural networks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>DEEP LEARNING<|>Transformers are a key architecture used in deep learning for processing data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)<|>FOUNDATION MODELS (FM)<|>APIs allow interaction with foundation models for various applications<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
