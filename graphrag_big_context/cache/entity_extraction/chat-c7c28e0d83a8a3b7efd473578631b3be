Software support revenue slightly decreased by 3% (1% at constant currencies) to €11,495 million in 2023. Software licenses revenue decreased 14% (12% at constant currencies) mainly due to the shift toward cloud revenue. As such, the segment achieved a total software licenses and support revenue of €13,259 million. Total segment revenue nevertheless rose 5% (8% at constant currencies) and ended 2023 at €30,057 million. Overall, the share of more predictable revenue within the Applications, Technology & Services segment increased 1.6pp from 78.4% in 2022 to 80.0% in 2023. Cost of revenue increased 5% (8% at constant currencies) compared to the prior year, ending 2023 at €7,951 million. This development was mainly driven by an increase in cost of cloud. Consequently, segment profit increased 11% (15% at constant currencies) and reached €9,811 million in 2023, whereas segment margin improved 1.7pp (1.9pp at constant currencies).\n\n# Reconciliation of Cloud Revenues and Margins\n\n|€ millions, unless otherwise stated|Q1–Q4 2023 Actual Currency|Currency Impact|Constant Currency|Q1–Q4 2022 Actual Currency|Constant Currency|∆ in % Actual Currency|∆ in % Constant Currency|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cloud revenue – SaaS1|10,734|322|11,056|8,985|19|23| |\n|Cloud revenue – PaaS2|2,182|54|2,236|1,533|42|46| |\n|Cloud revenue – IaaS3|748|18|766|908|–18|–16| |\n|Cloud revenue|13,664|394|14,058|11,426|20|23| |\n|Thereof SAP S/4HANA Cloud revenue4|3,495|105|3,599|2,088|67|72| |\n|Cloud gross margin – SaaS1 (in %)|72.8| |73.1|72.1|0.7pp|1.0pp| |\n|Cloud gross margin – PaaS2 (in %)|84.7| |84.8|80.9|3.9pp|3.9pp| |\n|Cloud gross margin – IaaS3 (in %)|34.3| |32.5|35.2|–0.9pp|–2.6pp| |\n|Cloud gross margin (in %)|72.6| |72.7|70.3|2.2pp|2.4pp| |\n\n1 Software as a service: SaaS comprises all other offerings that are not shown as PaaS or IaaS.\n\n2 Platform as a service: PaaS primarily includes SAP Business Technology Platform, the SAP LeanIX portfolio, and SAP Signavio solutions.\n\n3 Infrastructure as a service: A major portion of IaaS comes from SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud.\n\n4 Mainly derived from the Applications, Technology & Services segment.\n\n# Financial Income, Net\n\nFinancial income, net, increased to –€456 million (2022: –€1,389 million).

Finance costs mainly consist of interest expense on financial liabilities and from derivative instruments (including a forward contract to hedge the USD purchase price from the Qualtrics sale against EUR-USD fluctuations. This forward contract matured in the second quarter of 2023 with a total realized loss of €91 million, of which €106 million was recognized in finance costs) amounting to €639 million (2022: €272 million), and IFRS 9-related fair value adjustments or losses from disposal of Sapphire Ventures investments totaling €525 million (2022: €1,802 million).
