To determine which risk factors pose the greatest threat to the viability of the SAP Group, we classify them as high, medium, or low based on 1) the likelihood that a risk factor will occur within the assessment horizon, and 2) the impact the risk factor would likely have on SAP’s business objectives were it to occur. The scales for measuring these indicators are given in the following tables.\n\n|Probability/Likelihood of Occurrence|Description|Impact Level|Impact Definition|Impact|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1% to 19%|Remote|Insignificant|Negligible negative impact on business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows|From €0 to €25 million|\n|20% to 39%|Unlikely|Minor|Limited negative impact on business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows|From €25 million to €50 million|\n|40% to 59%|Likely|Moderate|Some potential negative impact on business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows|From €50 million to €100 million|\n|60% to 79%|Highly Likely|Major|Considerable negative impact on business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows|From €100 million to €500 million|\n|80% to 99%|Near Certainty|Business-Critical|Detrimental negative impact on business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows|From €500 million|\n\nThe combination of the likelihood of a risk factor and its impact on SAP’s reputation, business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows leads to a subsequent classification as either “high,” “medium,” or “low.”\n\n| |Insignificant (€0 to €25 million)|Minor (€25 million to €50 million)|Moderate (€50 million to €100 million)|Major (€100 million to €500 million)|Business-Critical (from €500 million)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|80% to 99%|L|M|H|H|H|\n|60% to 79%|L|M|M|H|H|\n|40% to 59%|L|L|M|M|H|\n|20% to 39%|L|L|L|M|M|\n|1% to 19%|L|L|L|L|M|\n\nL = Low Risk, M = Medium Risk, H = High Risk\n\nTo further streamline our integrated report, we disclose material and relevant risk factors and focus on “major” and “business-critical” risk factors as per our assessment. Thus, the following risk factors are not included in the Integrated Report 2023 as they do not currently fall into either the “major” or “business-critical” category: Corporate Governance; Environment and Sustainability; Sales and Revenue Conditions; Liquidity; Use of Accounting Policies and Judgment; Currency, Interest Rate, and Share Price Fluctuation; Insurance and Venture Capital; Unauthorized Disclosure of Information; Investor Relations; Corporate Affairs; Marketing; Portfolio; SAP Strategy; Human Workforce.\n\n129/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThe following table provides an overview of major and business-critical risk categories (together with the respective risk factors).
