Our Global Health, Safety & Well-Being team provides global frameworks and a comprehensive health, safety, and well-being portfolio to enable SAP’s business with its organizations at all levels to run healthy and safe. Please also refer to GRI 403-6 and GRI 2-8.|SAP + external parties|3|\n|403-4|Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety|SAP’s Health & Safety program “Run Healthy” includes a self-assessment conducted by a cross-functional staffed council in order to drive tailor-made and effective local programs and initiatives. Digital solutions are leveraged to guide SAP’s people to their relevant health content by considering individual needs and location and to gather their feedback to drive highest standards of quality, as we do with the permanent Qualtrics-based Health Feedback Survey across all health and well-being offerings. A Run Healthy council is the execution entity for the Run Healthy program (see GRI 403-1 for its purpose and target). It meets regularly (usually quarterly) and contains the Run Healthy lead, different line-of-business representatives, such as from the Human Resources, Real Estate and Facilities, and Health departments, as well as an employee representative. The program is being expanded step by step; not all SAP employees are represented by the Run Healthy program.

Employees have access to these services and are informed about them in SAP’s internal employee portal, monthly newsletters, live sessions, and campaigns, or by contacting the SAP Health team directly. In addition, we have Web-based tools such as the SAP Health Navigator which guides SAP people toward health offerings and tips according to their individual needs.
