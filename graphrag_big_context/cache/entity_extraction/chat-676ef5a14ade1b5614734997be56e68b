In judging whether a unit qualifies as a business for restructuring purposes, we consider if the unit has its own management team, has access to all inputs and processes necessary to provide outputs, and generates or could generate revenues. The materiality of a change to a business is assessed based on both the size and the nature of the change and therefore does not necessarily involve a material quantitative impact on our financial statements.\n\n# Restructuring Expenses\n\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Employee-related restructuring expenses|–222|–85|–25|\n|Onerous contract-related restructuring expenses and restructuring-related impairment losses|8|–52|–132|\n|Restructuring expenses|–215|–138|–157|\n\n181/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nMost of the restructuring expenses recognized in 2023 relate to the targeted restructuring program in selected areas of the company that SAP announced and launched in the first quarter of 2023 to further focus on its strategic growth areas and accelerated cloud transformation. Restructuring expenses primarily include employee-related benefits such as severance payments. The restructuring costs presented in 2022 mainly include expenses related to the wind-down of business in Russia and Belarus.\n\nIf not presented separately in our income statement, restructuring expenses would have been classified in the different expense items in our income statement as follows:\n\n|Restructuring Expenses by Functional Area|€ millions|2023|2022|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cost of cloud| |7|20|–127|\n|Cost of software licenses and support| |–8|–9|–6|\n|Cost of services| |–31|–70|–13|\n|Research and development| |–42|–16|–12|\n|Sales and marketing| |–121|–58|3|\n|General and administration| |–19|–4|–2|\n|Restructuring expenses| |–215|–138|–157|\n\n182/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Section C – Financial Results\n\nThis section provides insight into the financial results of SAP’s reportable segments and of SAP overall as far as not already covered by previous sections. This includes but is not limited to segment results, income taxes, and earnings per share.\n\n# (C.1) Results of Segments\n\n# General Information\n\nAt year end 2023, SAP had five operating segments that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, which is responsible for assessing the performance of the Company and for making resource allocation decisions as our chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The operating segments are largely organized and managed separately according to their product and service offerings. The Applications, Technology & Services (ATS) segment is SAP’s only reportable segment.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the non-reportable SAP Signavio segment was dissolved and integrated into the Applications, Technology & Services segment.\n\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2023, we sold our stake in Qualtrics, a formerly reportable segment. For more information about the sale of Qualtrics, see Note (D.1).\n\nDue to their size, the following segments are non-reportable:\n\n- The Emarsys segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of cloud-based customer experience offerings and from the sale of related services.\n- The Taulia segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of working capital solutions.\n- The Business Network segment combines SAP’s network offerings, covering procurement, logistics, asset management, and industry-specific solutions spanning end-to-end value chains. The segment generates revenues from cloud application subscriptions, transactional fees, and services.\n- The Sustainability segment bundles a portfolio of sustainability-related solutions that enables SAP’s customers to record and report financial and non-financial metrics and act on improving their sustainability footprint across all ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) dimensions.\n\nThe segment information for 2023 and the comparative prior periods were restated to conform with the new segment composition.\n\n# Segment Reporting Policies\n\nOur management reporting system, and hence our segment reporting system, reports our intersegment services as cost reductions and does not track them as internal revenue. Intersegment services mainly represent utilization of human resources of one segment by another segment on a project basis. Intersegment services are charged based on internal cost rates including certain indirect overhead costs but excluding a profit margin.\n\nMost of our depreciation and amortization expense affecting segment profits is allocated to the segments as part of broader infrastructure allocations and is thus not tracked separately on the operating segment level. Other depreciation and amortization expense is directly allocated to the operating segments.\n\nOur management reporting system produces a variety of reports that differ by the currency exchange rates used in the accounting for foreign-currency transactions and operations, where both actual and constant currency numbers are reported to and used by our CODM. Reports based on actual currencies use the same currency rates as are used in our financial statements. Reports based on\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nWe report revenues and expenses using the average exchange rates from the previous year’s corresponding period in constant currencies.\n\nWe use an operating profit indicator to measure the performance of our operating segments. The accounting policies applied in the measurement of operating segment expenses and profit differ as follows from the IFRS accounting principles used to determine the operating profit measure in our income statement:\n\nThe expense\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
