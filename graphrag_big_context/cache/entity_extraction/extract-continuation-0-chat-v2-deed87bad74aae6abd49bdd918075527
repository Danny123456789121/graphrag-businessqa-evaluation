Since managers’ frames “do not spring up randomly, but rather are the encoding of their prior history” (Kaplan & Tripsas, 2008: 791), we would expect that a range of factors at personal, organizational, and institutional levels will influence the formation of cognitive content and structure. With regard to personal background, researchers have argued that personality traits, such as need for closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) and tolerance for ambiguity (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), play an important role in sensemaking under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity (McKenzie, Woolf, van Winkelen, & Morgan, 2009). With regard to the organization as a context for managerial decision making (Gioia & Thomas, 1996; Weick, 1979), the influence of organizational structure on managers’ cognition (Hannaway, 1985) may differ between centralized and decentralized organizations (Pugh et al., 1963). Moreover, since managers’ cognitive frames are shaped by the particular institutional fields they have been exposed to (Weber & Glynn, 2006), dominant and contested institutional logics (Purdy & Gray, 2009; Reay & Hinings, 2009) may prime different cues and privilege certain frames over others (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research into the antecedents of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame will help us to understand who the managers are that are more likely to adopt a pragmatic or a prudent stance on sustainability issues.\n\nOur focus on cognition at the individual level raises the question of how different cognitive frames and the resulting decision-making.\n\nstances relate to organizational action (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993). We see at least two key aspects at the interface between individual cognition and organizational action that merit further investigation: the activation of frames and the dominance of frames. A better understanding of the factors that trigger a stronger or weaker activation of the two frames promises relevant insights. Such factors may be found within the organization—for instance, in an organizational climate of participation (Tesluk, Vance, & Mathieu, 1999) and creativity (Ekvall, 1996)— or outside the organization—in major regulative, technological, or economic discontinuities (Griffith, 1999; Tushman, Newman, & Romanelli, 1986). Moreover, since managerial cognition is a social process within an organizational context (Daft & Weick, 1984), individual frames will only translate into organizational action when they are transformed “into the organization’s predominant collective frames” (Kaplan, 2008: 730). Collective cognitive frames are the outcome of a political process where organizational members compete over the dominant interpretation of an issue (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991). Future research could address the factors that enable decision makers to translate their own cognitive frame into the dominant collective frame. Overall, further development of the cognitive framing perspective may result in a more comprehensive theory that establishes a connection among individual history, cognition, and agency.\n\nWe believe that our cognitive framing perspective and our propositions provide ample opportunities for future empirical studies. Given the nascent state of research into tensions and cognitive diversity in sustainability, scholars may find it most fruitful to use both quantitative and qualitative methods (Edmondson & McManus, 2007). However, testing our propositions through quantitative research presupposes the development of measurement scales for the business case frame and the paradoxical frame. To gain insights into the cognitive processes of decision makers who use business case frames or paradoxical frames, (semi-)qualitative methods, such as interviews, content analyses, and exploratory case studies, will be particularly suitable (Grégoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2010; Lüscher & Lewis, 2008).\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that a cognitive framing perspective offers a better understanding of managerial decision making on sustainability issues by recognizing the importance of a greater cognitive diversity of managers with regard to the content and structure of their frames. Our goal in this research, therefore, has not been to advocate a specific cognitive frame but, rather, to pave the way for the consideration of different cognitive perspectives on complex and ambiguous issues, such as corporate sustainability.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nAlbert, S., & Whetten, D.
