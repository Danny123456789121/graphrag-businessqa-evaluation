The following functional areas help implement our People Strategy: Future of Work (including Global Health, Safety & Well-Being), Global Diversity & Inclusion, SAP Learning, Talent Attraction, Total Rewards, and our Global People Success Services team, which includes the HR Business Partner organization, People Experience, and Global HR Service Delivery.\n\n# Guidelines and Policies\n\nSAP is committed to ensuring the fair and equal treatment of all employees in a sustainable manner. For that reason, we established comprehensive policies that guide us in our daily business. Examples include our SAP Global Antidiscrimination Statement and SAP Health & Safety Commitment Statement.\n\n# How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\nThe impact of our People Strategy is measured by seven KPIs (see table “Our Key People-Related KPIs at a Glance”). Five out of the seven KPIs are based on the results of our engagement survey program #Unfiltered. With #Unfiltered, we strengthen our commitment to listen regularly to our employees and act together on their feedback. Our focus in 2023 was on continuing our efforts to further strengthen the excitement about the future of SAP. We gauged the sentiment on employee.\n\nAs a result of the departure of Sabine Bendiek, as of January 1, 2024, SAP’s HR function has been re-established as an independent Board area named People & Culture.\n\nThe Commitment Statement, first published in February 2023, is the public version of our internal SAP Global Health & Safety Policy.\n\nBoth links lead to information that was not part of the statutory audit or the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n82,651 employees participated in the #Unfiltered survey in April (response rate: 76%), and 78,041 employees participated in the #Unfiltered survey in October (response rate: 71%). All headcount (HC)-relevant employees and, in addition, in Germany, the non-HC relevant employees on parental leave, on long-term sick leave, with a tenure of more than six months, PhD students, and vocational trainees were invited to take part in the 2023 #Unfiltered survey cycle.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\nengagement (which includes excitement for the future of SAP), leadership trust, and health and well-being along with other topics twice in 2023. The average scores from both data collections were used as the full-year Employee Engagement Index and Leadership Trust Net Promoter Score. Additional people-related KPIs can be found in the Report data Hub.\n\n# Our Key People-Related KPIs at a Glance\n\n| |Employee Engagement Index|Leadership Trust|Business Health Culture Index| | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|percent| | |Net Promoter Score|percent| | | |\n|86|83|80| | | | | |\n|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023| | | |\n|80|+–0pp|71|–1pts|81|+–0pp| | |\n|Innovation Index|Simplification of Processes|Employee Retention|Women in Management| | | | |\n|percent|percent|percent|percent| | | | |\n|87|+–0pp|62|–2pp|96.4|+3.6pp|29.7|+0.4pp|\n\n# Build SAP’s Skills for the Future\n\nSAP is committed to accelerating cloud growth. This requires workforce upskilling and expansion. Attracting, hiring, onboarding, developing, and retaining top talent is vital for our future success. In 2023, we focused on internal roles and strategic investment areas to support our transformation and long-term growth. The competitive talent market underscores the need to further communicate our Employer Value Proposition, encourage employee ambassadorship, and promote referrals. We remain committed to fostering inclusivity across generations, genders, nationalities, and more, to ensure a rich and diverse workforce.\n\nFor 2023, it remained our ambition to have 30% of management roles held by women. Our aspiration is to reach gender parity in our workforce at all levels and to retain women leaders.\n\n# Footnotes\n\n21 Information was not part of the statutory audit or the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n22 Employee Engagement Index: For more information, see the Performance Management System section. The Employee Engagement Index target range for 2023 was 76% to 80%; this range will also be the target for 2024.\n\nLeadership Trust Net Promoter Score: for more information, see the Performance Management System section.\n\nBusiness Health Culture Index (BHCI): Indicates the extent to which SAP successfully offers employees a working environment that promotes health, and supports their long-term employability and their active engagement in reaching our corporate goals. The index covers questions concerning how employees rate their personal well-being, the working conditions at SAP, and our leadership culture. The BHCI is calculated based on the results of our #Unfiltered program (April 2023 survey). For 2024 through 2025, our ambition remains to keep the BHCI between 78% and 80%.\n\nInnovation Index: Indicates to what extent we foster an innovation culture. The index is measured by three questions in our #Unfiltered program (April 2023 survey).\n\nSimplification of Processes: Shows the impact of our continued efforts to simplify our processes. The index is measured by nine questions in our #Unfiltered program (October 2023 survey).\n\nEmployee Retention: Ratio of the average number of employees minus the employees who left voluntarily, to the average number of employees, taking into account the past 12 months (in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a global software corporation that specializes in enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, focusing on cloud growth and workforce upskilling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINA VARGIU-BREUER<|>PERSON<|>Gina Vargiu-Breuer is a member of the SAP Executive Board who joined in February 2024.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SABINE BENDIEK<|>PERSON<|>Sabine Bendiek was previously associated with SAP's HR function before its re-establishment as an independent Board area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>#UNFILTERED<|>EVENT<|>#Unfiltered is an employee engagement survey program at SAP aimed at gathering feedback from employees to improve workplace culture and performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEOPLE & CULTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>People & Culture is the re-established independent Board area of SAP's HR function as of January 1, 2024.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL HEALTH & SAFETY POLICY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP Global Health & Safety Policy outlines the company's commitment to employee health and safety.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GINA VARGIU-BREUER<|>SAP<|>Gina Vargiu-Breuer is a member of the SAP Executive Board, contributing to the company's strategic direction<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SABINE BENDIEK<|>SAP<|>Sabine Bendiek was previously involved in SAP's HR function, influencing its policies and strategies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>#UNFILTERED<|>SAP<|>The #Unfiltered survey is a key initiative by SAP to measure employee engagement and gather feedback<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEOPLE & CULTURE<|>SAP<|>People & Culture is a new independent Board area within SAP focusing on HR functions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL HEALTH & SAFETY POLICY<|>SAP<|>The Global Health & Safety Policy is part of SAP's commitment to employee well-being and safety<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
