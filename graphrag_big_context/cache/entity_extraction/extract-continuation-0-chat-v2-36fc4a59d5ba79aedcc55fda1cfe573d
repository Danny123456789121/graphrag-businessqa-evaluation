We may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us. Additionally, we may experience difficulty carving out portions of or entire businesses, we may incur a loss of revenue or experience a negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. Such potential transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur additional expenses, disrupt customer, partner, and employee relationships, and may expose us to unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as a result of indemnification obligations.\n\nFurther, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject to risks such as a decline in the business to be divested, a loss of employees, customers, or suppliers, and the risk that the transaction may not close, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business to be divested as well as our retained business. If a divestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have incurred significant costs without the corresponding benefit.\n\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate risks and adverse effects. For example, we: perform technical, operational, financial, and legal due diligence on the company or assets to be acquired or divested; identify, implement, and track risk mitigation measures for material transactions or integration risks; and conduct process, risk, and control analyses that are subsequently integrated into SAP’s processes and control framework and supported by mitigations as required by any specific circumstances to subsequently increase adherence to SAP’s standards and policies.\n\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor were to occur, the impact could be moderate. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be unlikely, and classify this risk factor as low.\n\n# Innovation\n\nWe might not be able to compete effectively if we strategize our solution portfolio ineffectively or if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological and product innovations, enhancements, new business models, and changing market expectations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological and process innovations and new business models, as well as on our ability to develop new products and services, enhance and expand our existing products and services portfolio, and integrate products and services we obtain through acquisitions. To be successful, we are required to adapt our products and our go-to-market approach to a cloud-based delivery and consumption model so as to satisfy increasing customer demand and to ensure an appropriate level of adoption, customer satisfaction, and retention.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: inability to develop and sell new cloud products spanning various organizations on time and in line with market demands due to complexity in heterogeneous technical environments; inability to anticipate and develop.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\ntechnological improvements or succeed in adapting SAP products, services, processes, and business models to technological change, changing regulatory requirements, or emerging industry standards; a change in requirements of our customers and partners to strengthen the Intelligent Enterprise strategy; the possibility that our product and technology strategy might not be successful, or that our customers and partners might not adopt our technology platforms, applications, or cloud services quickly enough, or that they might consider other competing solutions in the market, or that our strategy might not match customers’ expectations and needs, specifically in the context of expanding the product portfolio into additional markets.\n\nWe are integrating AI into a number of our products, including our suite of enterprise applications and SAP BTP, and we expect our use of AI across our portfolio to continue to grow. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Data sets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by SAP or our partners could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required, which could introduce error or inefficiencies to the intended use of our AI-enabled offerings. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\n\nIn particular, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the applications of intellectual property and privacy laws to AI technology. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technology have not been fully addressed by courts or other laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our use of AI technology or integration of AI technology into our products and services may result in disputes with respect to ownership or intellectual property, or exposure to claims of copyright or other intellectual property misappropriation. In addition, our AI technology may involve the processing of personal and other sensitive data and may be subject to laws, policies, legal obligations, and contractual requirements related\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, focusing on integrating AI into its products and services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>EVENT<|>AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that SAP is integrating into its suite of enterprise applications and services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INNOVATION<|>EVENT<|>Innovation at SAP involves developing new products and services, enhancing existing offerings, and adapting to technological changes and market demands.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>AI<|>SAP is integrating AI into its products and services to enhance its offerings and meet customer demands<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>INNOVATION<|>SAP's success depends on its ability to innovate and adapt its product portfolio to changing market expectations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
