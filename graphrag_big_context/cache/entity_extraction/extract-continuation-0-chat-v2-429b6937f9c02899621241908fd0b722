Podlasie is one of the most religiously diverse regions in Poland. The Catholic and Orthodox congregations constitute 77% and 13.5% of all inhabitants of Podlaskie Voivodeship, respectively (in some districts, for example in the Hajnowski district, over 80% of the inhabitants are Orthodox Church believers) [65].\n\nThe research was conducted on a group of 73 participants of MBA studies at the Janski University in Łomża, one of the three centres of economic life in the region. The research included students of two editions of the studies—2019 and 2020. The study group is dominated by men (66%) and people with over 10 years of work experience (53%). All participants acquired higher education, which is a formal requirement for candidates for MBA studies.\n\n# 2.2. Research Tool\n\nThe technique of a survey was used. The research tool was constructed on the basis of a questionnaire used on Dutch company managers with regards to the application of sustainable human resource management [39]. It consists of a record and 24 statements relating to four aspects of sustainable human resource management (6 for each aspect): Social, psychological, environmental, and strategic.\n\nThe type and intensity of activities related to diversity management (social aspect) were identified on the basis of six statements concerning undertaking activities for older workers (1), various age groups (2), people with disabilities (3), various cultural groups (4), religious groups (5), and women (6).\n\nThe psychological aspect (the possibility for an employee to pursue a sustainable professional career) was diagnosed on the basis of 6 statements claiming that: Employees are treated as a key resource of the organization (1), they are provided with a job consistent with their interests and talents (2), coaching (3) and professional development (4) are available, the company covers the costs of training (5), and monitors the progress in employee behaviour towards sustainable development (6).\n\nInclusion of ecological issues in human resource management by enterprises was diagnosed on the basis of the assessment of statements concerning: The company’s taking into account the pro-ecological attitudes of job candidates (1) and during employee assessment (2), using public transport by employees (3) and compensating employees for their costs resulting from this (4), the use of ecological cars by the company (5), as well as the company’s canteen offering organic food (6).\n\nActivities reflecting the strategic aspect related to the practice and introduction of Sustainable HRM to the company’s strategy were diagnosed on the basis of the following statements: The HR department is involved in creating a sustainable development policy (1), the HR department has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan (2), the HR department has financial resources and human capital to initiate and promote actions for sustainability (3), declarations of respondents that they see the benefits of taking initiatives for sustainability (4) and their organization could be considered a model in this respect (5), and sustainability is an opportunity for the HR department.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\nto prove its strategic position in the company (6). It can be stated that these statements relate to the conscious (4 and 6) and behavioural (1, 2, 3, 5) aspects.\n\nThe responses were scaled using the seven-point Likert scale, on the basis of which the respondents assessed whether the action described in the statement was carried out in their company. The extreme values of the scale are “definitely no” (1) and “definitely yes” (7). The Cronbach’s alpha for the individual scales of the questionnaire is: 0.87; 0.87; 0.84; 0.89.\n\nThe statements included in the questionnaire made it possible to answer the questions of whether and what activities for Sustainable HRM are undertaken, according to the respondents, in their companies, and what is the relationship between activities undertaken by HR departments in the area of diversity management (social aspect), enabling the development of sustainable professional career (psychological aspect) as well as promoting pro-ecological behaviour (ecological aspect) and strategic HR activities. The answer to the above questions also allowed us to verify the research hypothesis.\n\n# 2.3. Selection and Application of Statistical Methods\n\nIn the first step, the skewness of the distributions was calculated (Tables 1–4). The absolute value of the obtained results was interpreted as follows [66]: 0–0.2 very weak asymmetry (distribution close to symmetric); 0.2–0.4 weak distribution asymmetry; 0.4–0.6 asymmetry of distribution strong; above 0.8, the asymmetry of distribution is very strong. As in most of the statements, the distributions of the answers were asymmetric and the skewness coefficient ranged from moderate to very strong, the calculation of the arithmetic mean and standard deviations was omitted in favour of median and mode. The basis for drawing conclusions about the implementation by the company’s HR department of individual types of activities in the field of sustainable development was the analysis of the distribution of answer variants given by the respondents (Figures 1–4). It was assumed that the selection of the answers “rather yes” (5), “yes” (6), and “definitely yes” (7) proves that the HR department undertook such actions, and selecting the answers “definitely no” (1), “no” (2), “probably not” (3), and “don’t know” (4) suggest that no such action is taken. On this basis, it was determined whether and what activities related to diversity management, building a sustainable professional career for employees, and shaping pro-ecological attitudes are practised in enterprises represented by MBA course students, and what activities related to sustainable human\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PODLASIE<|>GEO<|>Podlasie is a region in Poland known for its religious diversity, with significant Catholic and Orthodox populations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLAND<|>GEO<|>Poland is a country in Central Europe where Podlasie is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANSKI UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Janski University in Łomża is one of the three centers of economic life in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, offering MBA studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ŁOMŻA<|>GEO<|>Łomża is a city in Poland, part of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, where Janski University is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MBA STUDIES<|>EVENT<|>MBA studies at Janski University involve a group of participants acquiring higher education and professional skills.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAJNOWSKI DISTRICT<|>GEO<|>Hajnowski district is a specific area within Podlasie known for its high percentage of Orthodox Church believers.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODLASIE<|>POLAND<|>Podlasie is a region located within the country of Poland<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JANSKI UNIVERSITY<|>ŁOMŻA<|>Janski University is situated in the city of Łomża<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MBA STUDIES<|>JANSKI UNIVERSITY<|>MBA studies are conducted at Janski University<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAJNOWSKI DISTRICT<|>PODLASIE<|>Hajnowski district is a part of the Podlasie region<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
