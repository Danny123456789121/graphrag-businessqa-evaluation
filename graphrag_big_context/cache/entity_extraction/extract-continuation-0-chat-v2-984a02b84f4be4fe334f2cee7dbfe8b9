The Customer NPS score is calculated based on the “Likelihood to Recommend” question with its proprietary scoring, identified on a scale of 0–10. We use this measure because we believe that we can only achieve our financial goals when our customers are loyal to, and satisfied with, SAP and our solutions. To derive the Customer NPS, we start with the percentage of “promoters” of SAP, that is, those giving us a score of 9 or 10 on a scale of 0–10. We then subtract the percentage of “detractors,” that is, those giving us a score of 0–6. The method ignores “passives,” that is, those giving us a score of 7 or 8. Consequently, the range of achievable scores is –100 to +100, with the latter being the best achievable score for customer loyalty as measured by the Customer NPS methodology. Starting in 2023, we made adjustments to the survey to further improve data quality and to align the sample more closely with SAP’s business priorities. We have excluded incomplete responses and responses from respondents who report that they have no influence over purchasing decisions, and we have restricted the number of eligible responses from Concur.\n\n# Employee Engagement Index and Leadership Trust NPS\n\nWe determine the Employee Engagement Index and the Leadership Trust NPS as the average of the scores retrieved in each of the surveys we run within a fiscal year. Our engagement survey program “#Unfiltered” runs according to a “continuously listening” approach that includes multiple data collections throughout the year. The average scores provide an assessment, for the full year, of our employees’ engagement and trust level.\n\nWe measure both the Employee Engagement Index and the Leadership Trust NPS to get insights on the following:\n\n- Employee Engagement Index: We use this index to measure the satisfaction and commitment of our employees, how proud they are of our company, and how strongly they identify with SAP. Applying this measure is recognition that our growth strategy depends on engaged employees. The index is measured as a percentage of favorable responses using five questions from our #Unfiltered engagement survey program.\n- Leadership Trust NPS: We use this score to further enhance accountability and to measure our collective effort to foster a work environment based on trust. It is derived from a question in our surveys that gauges employees’ trust in our leaders. Based on the Customer NPS methodology, the Leadership Trust NPS is calculated as a percentage of “promoters” (a score of 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale) minus the percentage of “detractors” (a score of 1 through 6). The method ignores “passives” (a score of 7 or 8). Consequently, the value range of the NPS is –100 to +100, with the latter being the best achievable score.\n\n# Women in Executive Roles (WiER)\n\nStarting in 2024, we will use this KPI to measure the ratio of women to all genders in the three executive levels below the SAP Executive Board, namely the Global Executive Team, the Senior Executive Team, and the Executive Team.\n\n59/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nSAP is dedicated to promoting gender equality in the workplace and is working toward achieving gender balance at all levels of the organization. Our priority, with the help of this KPI, is to monitor how the Company is progressing on this commitment, especially at the most senior levels of the organization.\n\n# Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nWe use the following metrics to measure our progress toward our ambitious short-term and long-term climate targets (in kilotons of CO2 equivalents, rounded to the nearest kiloton). We define, measure, and report our greenhouse gas emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.\n\n- Net carbon emissions: We used this metric to measure our progress toward our ambition to become carbon neutral in our own operations by 2023. The net carbon emissions (scope 1, scope 2, and selected scope 3 emissions) are calculated by deducting self-produced renewable energy, renewable energy certificates, and carbon offsets from our gross carbon emissions. The net carbon emissions metric will be discontinued from 2024 and replaced by the Gross greenhouse gas emissions metric.\n- Gross greenhouse gas emissions: Starting in 2024, we will use this metric to measure greenhouse gas emissions along the value chain (scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions relevant for SAP’s business model) as part of our Net Zero by 2030 commitment. We apply a market-based approach. Renewable energies, for example in the form of self-generated renewable electricity, investments in certified renewable energy certificates, long-term green electricity contracts (power purchase agreements), or renewable electricity purchased by our suppliers and customers can be counted toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Value-Based Management\n\nOur holistic view of the performance measures described above, and the associated analyses, are together the foundation of our value-based management. We use planning and control processes to manage the compilation of these key measures and their availability to our decision-makers across various management levels.\n\nSAP’s long-term strategic plans are the point of reference for our short- and medium-term planning and controlling processes. We initially identify future growth and profitability drivers at a highly aggregated level for the entire SAP Group. In a first step, the financial plan’s growth ambition is determined by its comprehensive product portfolio which is grouped into solution areas, with profitability drivers allocated to functions such as development, marketing, sales, delivery, and administration.
