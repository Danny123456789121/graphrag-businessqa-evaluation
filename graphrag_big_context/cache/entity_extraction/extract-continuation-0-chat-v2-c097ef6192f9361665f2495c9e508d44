The main components are emissions from business flights, rental cars, train travel, and business trips with private cars. The calculation approach is the same as outlined above in the Carbon Neutrality 2023 section.\n\n286/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– Employee Commuting: Includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions of employees for transportation of employees between their homes and their worksites during the reporting year in vehicles not owned or operated by SAP. The calculation approach is the same as outlined above in the Carbon Neutrality 2023 section for the category employee commuting.\n\n# Downstream Scope 3\n\nUse of Sold Products: A big part of our overall emissions stems from the use of our software (customers running SAP solutions on their hardware and premises). Due to our lack of control over our customers’ IT landscapes, these emissions are not included in our carbon neutrality 2023 target. Nonetheless, we have been calculating the emissions for indicative purposes for many years. We are also taking them into account for our net zero 2030 target. Because of this, and to enhance the accuracy of the calculation, we refined the calculation methodology in 2023. The estimated energy consumption is extrapolated globally based on an average number of productive installations and average PUE, derived from SAP’s external data centers. Previously, we relied only on planning data to estimate the average system size. Now, we also use real data from our customers to calculate the weighted average system size. In addition, we revisited the underlying data base. The data base we used in the past for indicative purposes included systems with active and non-active maintenance contracts. Because of this, carbon emissions from products in use had been significantly overstated. For systems without maintenance contracts, SAP has no transparency on whether the solutions are still in use. Therefore, from 2023 onwards, we only consider on-premise solutions with active maintenance contracts. This way, we ensure that only active, still functional software products are used in the calculation.\n\nEmissions are calculated using a global electricity emission factor. The calculation covers all of our major solutions, including on-premise software. Cloud solutions are not included, as they are part of internal, co-location, and hyperscale datacenter electricity emissions. Mobile solutions (for example, SAP apps running on customer IT equipment) are also not included.\n\nSAP aims to constantly improve the calculation methodology. Calculation parameters will be adapted when significant technology changes occur or more accurate data sources are available.\n\n# Excluded Scope 3 Emissions\n\nThe following Scope 3 emissions sources are not applicable or insignificant to SAP’s business operations: Downstream transportation and distribution, processing of sold products, end-of-life treatment of sold products, downstream leased assets, franchises, and investments. Additionally, the category upstream leased assets are not relevant for SAP since we have classified emissions resulting from leased assets as Scope 1 and 2 emissions following the operational control approach of the GHG Protocol.\n\n# Baseline for Net Zero\n\n# SAP’s 2023 Gross Carbon Emissions Along the Value Chain (Market-Based)\n\n|Scope 3 Upstream|Scope 1 & 2|Scope 3 Downstream|\n|---|---|---|\n|1.2 M tons CO2e|0.1 M tons CO2e|5.6 M tons CO2e|\n|17%|2%|81%|\n|1%|13%|3%|\n|Travel and commute|Purchased goods and services|Capital goods|\n|Use of Sold Products|Use of Sold Products|Use of Sold Products|\n|6.9 M tons CO2e|6.9 M tons CO2e|6.9 M tons CO2e|\n\n287/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Renewable Electricity\n\nAs outlined in the Energy and Emissions section, SAP uses electricity from renewable energy sources to abate electricity-related emissions. This is a strategic lever to achieve our carbon neutrality target and net zero target.\n\n# Quality Criteria\n\nWe define renewable electricity as electricity coming from renewable electricity sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, sustainably sourced biomass (including biogas), and sustainable hydropower. As recommended by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and CDP/RE100, we actively look for the best available quality and standards, which support renewable electricity projects that meet robust criteria in terms of environmental integrity, reporting and verification. We have defined quality criteria for the procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) by SAP to drive change in the electricity market and to avoid the risk caused by low-quality products. The key characteristics of our renewable electricity purchasing guidelines are as follows:\n\n# Quality Criteria for SAP’s Procurement of EACs\n\n|Type of Renewable Electricity|Currently, SAP only considers solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind for its own renewable electricity sourcing.|\n|---|---|\n|Installation|The power plant producing the renewable electricity shall not be older than 10 years. In case of renovation of an old power plant, the 10-year rule applies only to the additional electricity output due to efficiency increase. SAP strives to not consider EACs from government-supported power plants.|\n|Vintage|The renewable electricity must be produced in the same year or the year preceding the reporting period to which it will be applied.|\n|EKOenergy|All of our purchased renewable electricity is EKOenergy-certified, a high-quality, internationally recognized not-for-profit ecolabel for renewable energy installations that fulfill additional sustainability criteria.
