It projects that “spending on digital technology by organizations will grow at 7x the economy in 2024, as companies are compelled by market demands to grow digital business models and strengthen digital capabilities,”2 and finds that “in a scenario where agility is paramount, a continued reliance on legacy systems can be detrimental. As we move closer to 2025, organizations must prioritize this transition not just to be at the forefront of their market but simply to survive.”3\n\nAccording to IDC, “by early 2025, organizations still on legacy systems will need to modernize their applications immediately to survive and adapt to the digital world already surpassing them.”3 In addition, by 2028, “organizations with established digital business platforms will have 50% higher digital market share with greater abilities to track ROI and execute digital revenue initiatives,”2 and “85% of CIOs will leverage organizational changes to harness AI, automation, and analytics, driving agile, insight-driven digital businesses.”4\n\nConcerning sustainability, IDC expects that “by 2027, G2000 organizations’ business and IT leaders will dedicate at least 20% of their digital tech spending toward sustainability initiatives”, “meeting their digital goals while taking sustainability into account. These types of sustainability initiatives will increase in the next five years as significant parts of digital technology investment strategies.”2\n\nIn particular, IDC reports that “tools and technologies that facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting of ESG metrics will be essential” to “mitigate legal risks and enhance their brand and competitive advantage.”4 It predicts, for example, that “applications that enable real-time carbon footprint tracking and integrate seamlessly with green supply chain mechanisms will transition from a nice-to-have to a must-have”3 and that, therefore, “the automation of regulatory compliance will be essential for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting accurate ESG metrics to meet regulatory standards.”4\n\n# Impact on SAP\n\nThe global economy is currently impacted by multiple crises, such as political tensions, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, disruptions of supply chains, and increasing natural disasters due to climate change. Nevertheless, SAP’s resilience is remarkable and with 83% of our revenue recurring, the Company is able to withstand economic pressure to a large degree. Even so, SAP must continue to evolve and remain agile while continuously adapting to a fast-changing landscape.\n\nIn 2024 and beyond, SAP plans to execute along the refined corporate strategy, with increasing focus on key strategic growth areas, such as cloud adoption, SAP Business AI, and value for customers. This makes us confident in our ability to expand our addressable market and deliver sustained topline growth. In addition, given our increased focus on operational efficiency, we are very confident we will be able to achieve our midterm ambition.\n\n# Financial Targets and Prospects\n\n# Revenue and Operating Profit Targets and Prospects (Non-IFRS)\n\n# Outlook 2024\n\nThe outlook for 2024 has been prepared in accordance with our updated non-IFRS definition from 2024.
