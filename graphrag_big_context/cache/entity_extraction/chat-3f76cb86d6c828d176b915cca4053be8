In this context, corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has been a central focus of attention. This paper aims to analyze CSP determinants in Brazil, an important emerging market. Firm CSP is proxied by the membership to the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) which comprises environmental, social, economic and governance issues.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Logit panel data models are estimated for a sample of 2,685 firm-year observations in the period of 2006-2015.\n\nFindings – Results show that firms operating in environmental risky industries tend to be leading CSP firms in Brazil which might be a positive consequence of the Brazilian environmental legislation that could be forcing such firms to be more committed to environmental issues. High ownership concentration reduces the probability of a firm’s membership to the ISE index signaling that large controlling blockholders may not see sustainability and governance concerns as relevant. Larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities tend to be CSP leaders. Additionally, the financial crisis of 2007-2009 had a negative effect on CSP in Brazil.\n\nPractical implications – The implications of the present findings may be of interest to academics and firms’ stakeholders. The fact that firms from environmental risky industries exhibit higher concerns with CSP, probably because of the Brazilian environmental rules that has advanced in the past decades, show the prominence of policymakers in the critical scenario of environmental issues. When designing regulation, policymakers should be conscious of the importance of social issues and pay attention to all ways available to foster firm sustainability concerns. The additional evidence that dominant shareholders do not appear to see CSP as a relevant concern in Brazil points out an agency conflict in which large blockholders’ interests may be prevailing over other stakeholders’ interests. That is important to academics who study the role played by ownership structure on firm’s policies. Furthermore, larger firms, as well as the ones with more growth opportunities, seem to invest in CSP, possibly for seeing it as a way to generate competitive advantage.\n\nOriginality/value – As per the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper to point out the relevance of industry environmental sensitivity over firm’s commitment to sustainability issues in Brazil. Additional evidence is provided on the negative effect of ownership concentration on the probability of firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index using a longer period as well as robust logit panel data model estimates compared to previous studies. Unlike previous works, the paper analyzes the complexity of a sustainability index in the Brazilian market. Such index comprises corporate social responsibility, sustainability and corporate governance concerns. This set of concerns makes it a complex index and requires a deeper rationale for the determinants of CSP as proxied by the membership to it, under the stakeholder and agency theoretical frameworks.\n\nKeywords Determinants, Brazil, Sustainability index, Corporate social and sustainability performance\n\nPaper type Research paper\n\nVicente Lima Crisostomo is Associate Professor at the Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.\n\nFatima de Souza Freire is Professor at the University of Brasilia, Brasília, Brazil.\n\nMaria Rafaela De Oliveira Freitas is Accountant at Tribunal de Justiça do Estado do Ceará (Ceará State Court) and got her Master degree at Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil.\n\n# 1.

This range of stakeholders goes beyond the ones taken into account by the agency theory – shareholders, managers and creditors – and has caused a growing concern for firms about their operation, sustainability and relation with all stakeholders as predicted under the stakeholder theoretical framework. This means that the firm should not only worry about value creation for shareholders but also about the welfare of all social groups and the adequate interaction with the environment (Freeman and Phillips, 2002; Tullberg, 2013).\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) actions and the awareness to sustainability issues as a whole have been considered as able to improve firm’s reputation, with possible benefits on firm’s value, although the results are still inconclusive (Freeman et al., 2004; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Park et al., 2014). In this context, the assessment of corporate sustainability performance (CSP), taking into account environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) concerns, by specialized institutions has become usual, highlighting the importance given to social concerns and long-term sustainability of firms by market institutions (Chen and Nainggolan, 2018; Statman, 2006). The Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBOVESPA which comprises ESG issues of the Brazilian firm was launched in 2005 (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).\n\nThe motivating factors that drive corporate sustainability policy at the firm level have been highlighted as an important topic of research that requires additional attention (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007). Undertaking such research in emerging economies has also been highlighted as necessary (Ziegler and Schröder, 2010). In this regard, this work intends to advance research in the emerging markets framework by studying Brazil, an emerging economy with increasing international visibility, characterized by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
