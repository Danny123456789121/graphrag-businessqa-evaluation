Undertaking such research in emerging economies has also been highlighted as necessary (Ziegler and Schröder, 2010). In this regard, this work intends to advance research in the emerging markets framework by studying Brazil, an emerging economy with increasing international visibility, characterized by high private benefits of control, high ownership concentration and low protection of minority shareholders which favors the prevalence of controlling shareholders’ interests (Dyck and Zingales, 2004; La Porta et al., 1998). Besides, Brazil has faced some institutional advances in environmental protection in recent decades although there is still much to be done (Tollefson, 2016).\n\nUnder the Brazilian environmental legislation, Law 10.165/2000 categorized industries’ environmental risk and enforced government environmental control. At this moment, it is important to assess whether these institutional advances observed in the Brazilian environmental legislation have been able to produce effects on the firm level.\n\nThis research aims to analyze firm’s attributes that are related to social and sustainability policies of Brazilian firms, focusing on firm’s environmental risk and ownership concentration. In this regard, more recently, ownership structure has been suggested to play a role on firm’s social and sustainability policies because of distinct shareholders’ interests and the diversity in institutional contexts (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007; Li and Zhang, 2010), as well as the environmental risk of firm’s activities (Adams, 2002; Crifo et al., 2015; Hackston and Milne, 1996). Additionally, the study also searches for the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and its eventual recovery in the aftermath.\n\nTo achieve this purpose, logistic regression models were estimated for a panel data set of 327 Brazilian listed firms, in a total of 2,685 firm-year observations, in the period of 2006-2015. The annual membership to the ISE of BM&FBOVESPA is used as proxy for higher CSP.\n\nThe results show that firm’s membership to an environmental risky industry, according the Brazilian environmental law, is able to improve firm’s CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries are leading CSP firms in Brazil given that they present higher probability to be a component of the ISE sustainability index. The findings also indicate that CSP proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index is adversely affected by high ownership concentration. This reveals the presence of an agency conflict in which dominant shareholders’ interests prevail over CSP, given that the presence of such shareholders lowers the probability that the firm becomes member of the annual Brazilian ISE. It is worth\n\nmentioning that the negative effect of voting ownership concentration disappears with the presence of more large shareholders, taken into account by the voting ownership held by the four and five largest shareholders, signaling a possible contest power from other large shareholders who may favor CSR. Furthermore, other firm attributes also increase firm CSP, firm size and firm growth opportunities in Brazil.\n\nThe present work offers insights on the determinants of firm’s social and sustainability policies in an important emerging market (Brazil). The research builds on stakeholder and agency theories by investigating the possible effect of industry environmental risk and ownership concentration on CSP as proxied by firm’s membership to the Brazilian firm ISE. The study contributes to the literature that deals with firm membership to sustainability indices set by capital markets as a proxy for social and sustainability performance (Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Crisostomo and Oliveira, 2016; Artiach et al., 2010). Specifically, the paper complements prior studies in the Brazilian market about CSP determinants by taking into account the industry environmental risk, using a larger variety of proxies for ownership concentration, extending the period of study and using panel data methodology that provides even more robust results and allows better analysis on the CSP determinants.\n\n# 2. Background and hypotheses\n\n# 2.1 The assessment of corporate sustainability\n\nLiterature suggests that firms actions related to sustainability are associated with ethical, environmental and economic criteria of a firm’s decision-making process to ensure business continuity, while corporate social policy may be more associated to the willingness of the firm to undertake actions that benefit stakeholders (Van Marrewijk and Werre, 2003). As a whole, corporate social and sustainability concerns integrate business ethics and stakeholder management, being all associated and complementary concepts under development (Sarkar and Searcy, 2016; Carroll and Shabana, 2010). Conceptual questions apart, assessing the degree of attention that a firm directs to social and sustainability concerns is a complex task and there is still no agreement on how it should be done. In fact, there are a variety of measures used in this context trying to adequately evaluate firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).\n\nThe assessment of CSP as a whole may take into account firm sustainability, firm social concerns, business ethics, stakeholder management and environmental issues. Specialized institutions have worked on it and created indices that intend to convey information about the level of firms’ CSP (Statman, 2006). Examples of such indices are the ones created by market institutions like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index of the New York Stock Exchange; the FTSE-4Good in the London Stock Exchange; the Johannesburg Index in South Africa; and the Brazilian ISE set up by the Brazilian stock market.\n\n# 2.2 The Brazilian corporate sustainability index\n\nThe ISE index is a theoretical portfolio, composed by up to 40 firms that are included into it based\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
