Thus, there is no impairment risk resulting from the allocation of the LeanIX goodwill.\n\n# Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nThe key assumptions on which management based its cash flow projections for the period covered by the underlying business plans are as follows:\n\n|Key Assumption|Basis for Determining Values Assigned to Key Assumption|\n|---|---|\n|Budgeted revenue growth|Revenue growth rate achieved in the current year, adjusted for an expected increase in SAP’s addressable cloud and database markets; expected growth in the established software applications and analytics markets. Values assigned reflect our past experience and our expectations regarding an increase in the addressable markets.|\n|Budgeted operating margin|Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin achieved in the current year, increased by expected efficiency gains. Values assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains.|\n|Discount rates|Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using discount rates (after-tax rates). Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach.|\n|Terminal growth rate|Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were extrapolated using segment-specific terminal growth rates. These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which our segments operate.|\n\n# Key Assumptions and Detailed Planning Period\n\n|Percent, unless otherwise stated|Applications,1|Technology & Services| |Emarsys| |Taulia|Business Network| | |Sustainability|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Budgeted revenue growth (average of the budgeted period)|12.8|11.4|13.3|13.9|22.3|24.8|12.7|14.0|31.5|34.6|\n|After-tax discount rate|11.9|11.1|12.3|11.7|11.0|11.3|12.5|11.9|11.7|10.9|\n|Terminal growth rate|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|3.0|\n|Detailed planning period (in years)|5|5|12|12|13|13|10|10|12|12|\n\n1 The 2022 figures relate to the Applications, Technology & Support segment without the reallocation of the SAP Signavio segment.\n\nOn October 1, 2023, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the operating segments.\n\n# Applications, Technology & Services Segment\n\nFor more information about our 2023 segment changes, see Note (C.1). The recoverable amount was determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. The fair value measurement was categorized as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs used in the valuation. The cash flow projections were based on actual operating results and specific estimates covering a detailed planning period and the terminal growth rate thereafter. The projected results were determined based on management’s estimates and are consistent with the assumptions a market participant would make (a target operating margin of 34.5% (2022: 27.8%) was used in the valuation). We believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of our Applications, Technology & Services segment to exceed the recoverable amount.\n\n# Emarsys Segment\n\nThe recoverable amount was determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. The fair value measurement was categorized as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs used in the valuation. The cash flow projections were based on actual operating results and specific estimates covering a detailed planning period and the terminal growth rate thereafter. The projected results were\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\ndetermined based on management’s estimates and are consistent with the assumptions a market participant would make (a target operating margin of 33.2% (2022: 29.4%) was used in the valuation). Given the fact that the Emarsys segment is expected to show disproportionate growth in the coming years and has not yet reached a steady state, we have used a longer detailed planning period than one would apply in a more mature segment. The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount by €618 million (2022: €513 million).\n\n# Sensitivity to Change in Assumptions\n\n| |Emarsys| | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | | | |2023|2022|\n|Budgeted revenue growth (change in pp)| | | |–2.5|–2.0|\n| |Target operating margin at the end of the budgeted period (change in pp)| | |–21|–16|\n\n# Taulia Segment\n\nThe recoverable amount was determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation.

The projected results were determined based on management’s estimates and are consistent with the assumptions a market participant would make (a target operating margin of 26.5% (2022: 24.9%) was used in the valuation).
