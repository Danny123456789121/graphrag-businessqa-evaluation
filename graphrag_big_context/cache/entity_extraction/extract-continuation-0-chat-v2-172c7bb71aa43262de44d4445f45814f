The acquisition closed on March 9, 2022, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals; the operating results and the assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements starting on that date. Consideration transferred amounted to €705 million.\n\n**Taulia Acquisition: Recognized Assets and Liabilities**\n|€ millions| |\n|---|---|\n|Intangible assets|157|\n|Other identifiable assets|87|\n|Total identifiable assets|244|\n|Other identifiable liabilities|88|\n|Total identifiable liabilities|88|\n|Total identifiable net assets|156|\n|Goodwill|549|\n|Total consideration transferred|705|\n\nPrior to December 31, 2022, we completed our accounting assessment relating to the supply chain financing (SCF) transactions offered by Taulia. Based on the setup of the compartments and series within which the SCF receivables and liabilities are siloed, and on the related contractual and founding agreements, we concluded that we do not control the receivables and liabilities resulting from the SCF activities under IFRS 10. Thus, we do not include the respective items in our balance sheet and do not show cash flows linked to the SCF transactions in investing/financing cash flow.\n\nIn Q1 2023, measurement of tax-related assets and liabilities for the Taulia business combination accounting was completed and resulted in €28 million adjusted to the Other identifiable assets’ opening balance and Goodwill.\n\nIn general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces. Taulia goodwill was attributed to expected synergies from the acquisition, particularly in the following areas:\n\n- Cross-selling to existing SAP customers across all regions, using SAP’s sales organization\n- Further expanding the SAP Business Network capabilities and strengthening SAP’s solutions for the CFO office\n- Creating new offerings by combining Taulia products and SAP products\n- Improving profitability in Taulia sales and operations\n\nThe allocation of the goodwill resulting from the Taulia acquisition to our operating segments depends on how our operating segments actually benefit from the synergies of the Taulia business combination.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Impact of the Business Combination on Our Financial Statements\n\nThe amounts of revenue and profit or loss of the Taulia business acquired in 2022 since the acquisition date were included in our Consolidated Income Statement for 2022 as follows:\n\n# Taulia Acquisition: Impact on SAP’s Financials\n\n|€ millions|20221 as Reported|Contribution of Taulia|\n|---|---|---|\n|Revenue|30,871|59|\n|Profit after tax|1,708|–38|\n\n1 From continuing and discontinued operations\n\nHad Taulia been consolidated as at January 1, 2022, our revenue and profit after tax for 2022 would not have been materially different.\n\n# 2022 Divestitures\n\nOn August 17, 2022, SAP and Francisco Partners (FP) announced that FP had signed a definitive agreement with SAP America, Inc. under which FP would acquire SAP Litmos from SAP.
