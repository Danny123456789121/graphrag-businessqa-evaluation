It is part of a broader European initiative to create AI-related masters programs to build skills in areas such as AI ethics and AI’s application to health care.\n- The UNESCO-developed Artificial Intelligence and Digital Transformation Competency Framework provides guidance on the essential AI and digital competencies for civil servants. This initiative responds to a significant demand for efforts to enhance the digital skills of government officials, particularly in Africa. UNESCO conducted workshops in Africa and India to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges before formulating its solutions.\n\n# Examples of climate-related trainings:\n\n- The UN Climate Change Learning Partnership (UN CC:Learn) offers a range of introductory and advanced online courses for policymakers to learn how to address climate change and apply an integrated approach to climate action throughout the various stages of the policy cycle.\n- Climate Change and Energy: Policymaking for the Long Term is an executive education program for policymakers developed by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. It seeks to equip them with the knowledge, analytical tools, and frameworks needed to comprehend climate science and economics—and to craft policies and adaptation strategies.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Support the creation and expansion of AI and climate-related upskilling programs for corporates\n\n(for example, climate change training for AI experts, AI introduction for climate experts).\n\n# Example of AI for Climate trainings:\n\nThe Climate Change AI summer school aims to equip individuals who have a background in AI and/or climate change with the knowledge and skills necessary to address significant climate challenges using AI.\n\n# Examples of AI-related trainings:\n\nQuebec’s Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity has granted $23.4 million in funding to SCALE AI to upskill over 25,000 professionals, executives, and managers in AI between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe EU-funded project Artificial Intelligence Skills Alliance (ARISA) unites 20 partners for a four-year period (2022–2025) to create the European strategy for AI skills development, including up/reskilling curricula and learning programs.\n\n# Examples of Climate Change trainings:\n\nClimate-KIC, a knowledge and innovation community supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, provides education programs, at the intersection of zero-carbon, climate resiliency, and innovation, in Europe and online for postgraduates and professionals.\n\nThe national business support agency of Ireland, Skillnet, offers the Climate Ready Academy to help Irish businesses develop climate-related skills, including sector-specific programs such as the Energy Leaders Programme.\n\n# Build AI and climate modules within education curricula\n\n(for example, early-stage initiation for K-12, cross-skills for AI students or climate students, etc.).\n\n# Examples of climate-related curricula:\n\nSince September 2020, Italian students in every grade have spent 33 hours each year learning about climate change and sustainability, bringing Italy to the forefront of environmental education worldwide.\n\nIn the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Collection of Climate and Energy Educational Resources (CLEAN) provides open access to over 700 validated, ready-to-use teaching materials and guidelines suitable for secondary through higher education classrooms.\n\n# Examples of AI-related curricula:\n\nCountries such as Finland, the UK, Japan, and Singapore have introduced computational thinking and programming to pedagogical courses to increase students’ exposure to coding and computing at early stages of education.\n\nMorocco’s Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research, and Innovation has initiated the “Code 212” project, designed to help students acquire skills in coding, programming, big data, AI, and related fields. A core objective is to establish Code 212 centers in all national universities, thereby enhancing students’ digital competencies alongside their specialized studies.\n\n33\n\n# ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Deploy AI for Climate\n\nWhile enabling AI is necessary to help society mitigate and build resilience to climate impacts, policymakers can play an important role in accelerating the deployment of AI technologies in both the public and private sectors. We discuss each in turn.\n\n# Define and Deliver on Public Sector Priorities\n\nThe dozen AI use cases for climate outlined in Exhibit 3 are all important, but that doesn’t mean that they’re always equally important. Every country and region is different and each confronts its own distinct set of climate challenges given its geography, industry mix, human resources, and relative wealth. Therefore, every country or region needs to develop its own climate priorities and action plan.\n\nFor Germany, an industrial giant where the Climate Action Act mandates carbon neutrality by 2045, the priorities for AI might be accelerating the decarbonization of industries and driving energy efficiency. By contrast, Bangladesh—given its significant vulnerability to sea-level rise and extreme weather—might prioritize accelerating its National Adaptation Plan and developing early warning systems for communities.\n\nIn addition to identifying their high-priority use cases, policymakers must also expedite the application of AI to climate challenges. The public sector can serve as a pivotal catalyst for accelerating AI-supported climate action and set a compelling example for the entire economy. This is particularly important since, while 87% of organizations acknowledge the role of AI in climate action, only 40% can envision practical applications within their own operations.\n\n# Leaders could:\n\n- Integrate AI solutions and expertise into government strategic planning on climate priorities (for example, Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and sector-specific transition plans).\n\nExample:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
