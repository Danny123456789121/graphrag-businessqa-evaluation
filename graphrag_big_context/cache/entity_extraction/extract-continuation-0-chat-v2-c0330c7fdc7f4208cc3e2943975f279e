Establishing an inclusive supplier network â€“ that is, minority enterprises defined by gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and other characteristics, as well as certified social enterprises that focus their companyâ€™s mission on making social impact â€“ remains a priority for SAP. We believe that our commitment to an inclusive, bias-free culture in our workplace must be mirrored in our approach to our supplier base.\n\nDriven by our GPO, SAPâ€™s supplier diversity and social enterprise initiatives aim to build the capacity of diverse and social businesses to provide a fair chance at competing for contracts and are treated equally to other SAP suppliers.\n\nAs part of its PwP program, SAP was a corporate member of supplier and social enterprise certification organizations such as WEConnect International, Disability:IN, and Social Enterprise UK. These organizations enable the GPO to identify opportunities to engage with diverse suppliers and social enterprises, supporting our social procurement spend targets.\n\nIn addition, our GPO has started to implement a supplier qualification process based on sustainability indicators. This will enable the organization to increase visibility over our vendors, improve our.\n\nTop 100 suppliers by emissions are part of the pilot for the improved qualification process.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nengagement, and make an informed supplier selection based on environmental and social performance. This process captures information pertaining to the performance of our suppliers in three focus areas: Social, diverse, and inclusive supply chain; environmental supply chain; and human rights in the value chain. As a next step, the GPO plans to set up a Supplier Enablement Team as a dedicated team responsible for the supplier qualification process.\n\n# Addressing Supply Chain Legislation Across the World\n\nIn light of the uptake in legislative action around the world, such as the UK and Australian Modern Slavery Act and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), SAP respects the human rights in its own operations but equally in its supply chain. This includes, for instance, introducing new concepts for identifying human rights risks across our supply chain (for more information, see the Human Rights section).\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Sustainable Procurement section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor.\n\n275/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Waste and Water\n\n# Aspiring to a World of Zero Waste\n\nWe believe in SAPâ€™s capabilities to help transform the economy into a low-carbon, circular system to reach a restorative and regenerative world of zero waste and significantly cleaner oceans. In alignment with SAPâ€™s Global Environmental Policy, our waste and water strategy and corresponding company-wide initiatives aim to continuously reduce SAPâ€™s impact on the environment by generating less waste, reducing water consumption, and enabling our customer to do the same.\n\n# Being an Enabler: Leveraging Software Solutions\n\nSAP advocates global systems change at scale to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. To make the circular economy the de facto approach to material use and waste management, we are working with our customers and partners on solutions that address full-circle transparency across a wide range of material flows. For more details about our circular economy solutions, see the Product Strategy section and our Circular Economy Solutions Web site.\n\n# Being an Exemplar: Cutting Down Waste in Our Own Operations\n\n# Managing Our Discarded Electrical and Electronic Devices\n\nWaste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE, or e-waste) is one of the worldâ€™s fastest-growing waste streams. As a global cloud company running data centers for our customers and office buildings across the world with a large amount of IT devices in place for our more than 107,000 employees, the ecological footprint of our electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and their end-of-life treatment is a growing area of focus for SAP. In our Global Environmental Policy, we made the commitment to strive towards zero e-waste in our own operations by diverting close to 100% from incineration, landfill, and nature by 2030. As such, we cooperate with international and local IT asset lifecycle partners to reuse and recycle our e-waste. We also engaged with them to improve their sustainability roadmap â€“ helping to reach our own sustainability target for 2030 â€“ as well as with the Climate Neutral Data Centre\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a global cloud company that provides software solutions and services, focusing on sustainability and supplier diversity initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WECONNECT INTERNATIONAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WEConnect International is a certification organization that supports women-owned businesses and helps them connect with corporate buyers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISABILITY:IN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Disability:IN is an organization that advocates for the inclusion of people with disabilities in the workforce and supports businesses in their diversity efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL ENTERPRISE UK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Social Enterprise UK is a membership organization that supports social enterprises and promotes social value in business.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK MODERN SLAVERY ACT<|>EVENT<|>The UK Modern Slavery Act is legislation aimed at preventing modern slavery and human trafficking in supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIAN MODERN SLAVERY ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Australian Modern Slavery Act is legislation that requires businesses to report on their efforts to combat modern slavery in their operations and supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE ACT<|>EVENT<|>The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) mandates companies to ensure human rights are respected in their supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIRCULAR ECONOMY<|>EVENT<|>The circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through recycling and reuse.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>WECONNECT INTERNATIONAL<|>SAP is a corporate member of WEConnect International, supporting women-owned businesses through supplier diversity initiatives.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>DISABILITY:IN<|>SAP collaborates with Disability:IN to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in the workforce.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>SOCIAL ENTERPRISE UK<|>SAP engages with Social Enterprise UK to support social enterprises and promote social value in its supply chain.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>UK MODERN SLAVERY ACT<|>SAP respects human rights in its operations and supply chain in compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>AUSTRALIAN MODERN SLAVERY ACT<|>SAP adheres to the Australian Modern Slavery Act by ensuring transparency in its supply chain practices.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMAN SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE ACT<|>SAP implements measures to comply with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, ensuring human rights are respected.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>CIRCULAR ECONOMY<|>SAP advocates for the circular economy by developing solutions that promote sustainability and reduce waste.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
