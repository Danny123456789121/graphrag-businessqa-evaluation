This article relates to the area of Human Resource Management and activities undertaken by HR departments to implement the principles of sustainable development in the enterprise. In particular, it refers to the concept of Sustainable HRM, recognized by many researchers as a new paradigm in the area of HRM. Although an intensely-studied subject, there is a clear gap in research regarding Sustainable HRM in Polish companies. Additionally, there is a lack of research contribution on the Podlasie region—ecologically and ethnically the most diverse region in the country. While sustainability in environmental terms is evident in the region, the article focuses on sustainability implementation in the business sector. The article helps to close the research gap. Its aim is to examine the two-fold role of HR departments in: Implementing activities in the area of Sustainable HRM, and introducing the principles of sustainability to corporate strategies. It was assumed that such activities contribute to corporate sustainability. In order to verify the role of HR departments, a new, comprehensive research model, based on the work of De Prins, was built. The model relates to the double-task of HR departments in organizations. The added value of the article stems from the research model proposal, which can be applied without geographical limitations and to numerous organization types. The paper introduces one of the applications of the model—a regional one. The model was tested in a questionnaire survey conducted among employees of enterprises operating in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, which is unique in terms of environment, culture, and economy in Poland. The respondents were participants of MBA studies at one of the universities of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. The results of the study fully confirmed the hypothesis adopted in the study regarding the performance of activities by HR departments in the psychological and social areas of Sustainable HRM. The third aspect of the study, regarding the ecological area, was not clearly confirmed in the study. It was found that this may result from the restrictive law regulating the issue of the impact of enterprises on the natural environment. The results of the study allowed for the verification of the main hypothesis assumed in the research model, thus confirming its truthfulness.\n\n# Keywords\n\nSustainable HRM; corporate sustainability; manager’s opinion; Podlasie enterprises\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe aim of the article is to highlight the role of Human Resource Management (HRM) on the path to a sustainable organization. Stahl, Brewster, Colling, and Hajro [1] point to two different approaches to the HRM–CS (Corporate Sustainability) relation. One of these approaches is based on the assumption\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 8987; doi:10.3390/su12218987 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\nthat HR acts as a driver for CS. The other assumes that CS is seen as an enabler of sustainable HRM. This article is based on the assumption that the relation between CS and HRM is mutual, complex, and interactive. The article is theoretical and empirical in nature. It was created on the basis of a literature review on Sustainable HRM and Corporate Sustainability, as well as research conducted among employees of HR departments of companies operating in the region of north-eastern Poland.\n\nIn HRM literature, it is common to find that most HRM practices are shaped by strategic and economic aspirations of organizations to maximize profit [2,3]. This concept, which supports the managerial view of HRM practices and primarily aims at improving the economic performance of the company, is assumed to be the mainstream view of HRM [2, 3]. While corporations need to be profitable in order to ensure their existence; they cannot be interested in profits only when trying to reach Corporate Sustainability [4]. Organizations should be managed in the interest of more stakeholders than just the shareholder’s [5–9]. Sustainable HRM, by relating to multiple stakeholders, seems to bring the people and respect for humanity back to human resource management [10] and widen the future HR perspective by including both internal and external stakeholders as well as more employee-oriented thinking [11, 12]. Business should be conscientious not to exploit the most important asset of the company for the sole purpose of profit [13] (p. 132).\n\n# 1.1. Corporate Sustainability\n\nThe concept of CS is related to the broader concept of sustainable development, which has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” [14] (p. 43). Therefore, sustainability transported to the business level is referred to as Corporate Sustainability [15].\n\nIn reference to the concept of sustainable development (SD), Corporate Sustainability can be defined as meeting the needs of a firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well [15]. At the organizational level, this concept of SD has been translated to CS, which “entails the preservation, regeneration, and development of the ecological, economic and social resources of a system” [16] (\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BARBARA MAZUR<|>PERSON<|>Barbara Mazur is a researcher affiliated with the Department of Management at Lublin University of Technology, focusing on Sustainable Human Resource Management and Corporate Sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNA WALCZYNA<|>PERSON<|>Anna Walczyna is a researcher affiliated with the Department of Strategy and Business Planning at Lublin University of Technology, contributing to studies on Sustainable Human Resource Management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUBLIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lublin University of Technology is an educational institution in Poland where research on Sustainable HRM and Corporate Sustainability is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODLASIE<|>GEO<|>Podlasie is a region in Poland known for its ecological and ethnic diversity, where the study on Sustainable HRM was conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODLASKIE VOIVODESHIP<|>GEO<|>Podlaskie Voivodeship is a unique region in Poland where the research model for Sustainable HRM was tested among local enterprises.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABLE HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Human Resource Management refers to practices that integrate sustainable development principles into HRM, aiming for corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Sustainability is the business approach that meets the needs of stakeholders while ensuring the ability to meet future needs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARBARA MAZUR<|>LUBLIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY<|>Barbara Mazur is affiliated with Lublin University of Technology, where she conducts research on Sustainable HRM.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNA WALCZYNA<|>LUBLIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY<|>Anna Walczyna is affiliated with Lublin University of Technology, contributing to research on Sustainable HRM.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARBARA MAZUR<|>ANNA WALCZYNA<|>Barbara Mazur and Anna Walczyna are co-authors of research on Sustainable HRM and Corporate Sustainability.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODLASIE<|>PODLASKIE VOIVODESHIP<|>Podlasie is a region within the Podlaskie Voivodeship, where the research on Sustainable HRM was conducted.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABLE HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Sustainable Human Resource Management practices contribute to achieving Corporate Sustainability in organizations.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
