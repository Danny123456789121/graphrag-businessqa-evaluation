This includes a preliminary €2 billion estimate for payouts associated with the program, a €0.2 billion impact from a settlement earlier this year of pre-existing regulatory compliance matters accrued in 2023, and a €0.2 billion adverse impact due to the discontinuation of the SAP-triggered financing program.\n\n– An effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of around 32.0% (2023: 30.3%, based on the updated non-IFRS definition)\n\nFurthermore, SAP provides the following additional forward-looking information for selected metrics:\n\n– CCB: we expect a year-end growth rate similar that of 2023, while at a larger scale.\n\n– Cloud ERP Suite revenue: we expect to sustain the high growth rate in 2024.\n\nWhile SAP’s full-year 2024 business outlook is at constant currencies, numbers reported in actual currencies are likely to be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations as the year progresses. See the table below for the expected currency impacts for the full-year 2024. These expectations are based on the December 2023 level.\n\n|In percentage points (pp)|FY/2024|\n|---|---|\n|Cloud revenue growth|-2.0pp to 0.0pp|\n|Cloud and software revenue growth|-1.5pp to 0.5pp|\n|Operating profit growth (non-IFRS)|-2.0pp to 0.0pp|\n\nThe following table shows the estimates of the items that represent the differences between our non-IFRS financial measures and our IFRS financial measures for operating profit.\n\n|€ millions|Estimated Amounts for 2024|Actual Amounts for 2023|\n|---|---|---|\n|Acquisition-related charges|305–385|345|\n|Restructuring|about 2,000|214|\n|Regulatory compliance matters|0|155|\n\nFurthermore, the differences between free cash flow as our non-IFRS financial measure and operating cash flow as our IFRS financial measure include estimated cash flows in 2024 for leasing and capital expenditures of €1.2 billion (2023: €1.1 billion).\n\nWe do not provide an outlook for the effective tax rate (IFRS) due to the uncertainty and potential variability of gains and losses associated with equity investments, which are reconciling items between non-IFRS and IFRS.\n\n# Proposed Dividend\n\nIn 2024, we intend to pay a dividend of €2.20 per share (subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Shareholders Meeting in May 2024). For more information, see the Financial Performance: Review and Analysis section.\n\n# Ambition 2025\n\nIn this section, all numbers (except cloud revenue and total revenue) are based exclusively on non-IFRS measures.\n\n144/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nBy 2025, SAP now expects:\n\n- Non-IFRS cloud gross profit of approximately €16.2 billion, which now includes share-based compensation expenses of approximately €0.1 billion1\n- Non-IFRS operating profit of approximately €10.0 billion, which now includes share-based compensation expenses of approximately €2 billion1\n- Free cash flow of approximately €8.0 billion\n\nSAP continues to expect:\n\n- Cloud revenue of more than €21.5 billion\n- Total revenue of more than €37.5 billion\n- The share of more predictable revenue to be approximately 86%\n\nFurther, SAP strives for an acceleration of total revenue growth and an expansion of operating margin beyond 2025.\n\n1Non-IFRS. Our Ambition for 2025 has been adjusted in accordance with our updated non-IFRS definition applicable from 2024. For more information, see the Performance Management System section.\n\nNote: For a reconciliation of non-IFRS results to IFRS equivalents, see the Performance Management System section.\n\n# Investment Goals\n\nOur planned investment expenditures for 2024 and 2025, other than for business combinations, consist primarily of the purchase of IT infrastructure and the construction activities described in the Assets (IFRS) section. We expect investments in IT infrastructure to be approximately €400 million and in construction activities to be approximately €350 million in 2024. In 2024, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately €950 million. In 2025, capital expenditures are expected to decrease to approximately €700 million.\n\n# Goals for Liquidity and Finance\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our net liquidity was €3.5 billion. We believe that our liquid assets combined with our undrawn credit facilities are sufficient to meet our operating financing needs in 2024 as well, and, together with expected cash flows from operations, will support debt repayments and our currently planned capital expenditure requirements over the near and medium term.\n\nIn 2024, we expect a free cash flow of approximately €3.5 billion (compared to €5.1 billion in 2023) and of around €8.0 billion in 2025. The decline in free cash flow in 2024 will be driven predominantly by our preliminary €2.0 billion estimated outflow for restructuring, a €200 million outflow for compliance matters, and a €200 million adverse impact due to the discontinuation of the SAP-triggered financing program.\n\nIn 2024, we intend to repay €850 million in Eurobonds and US$323 million in U.S. private placements.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
