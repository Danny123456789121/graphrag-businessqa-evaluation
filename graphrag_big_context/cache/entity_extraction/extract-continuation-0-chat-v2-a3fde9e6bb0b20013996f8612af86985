As at December 31, 2023, SAP had repurchased 7,563,796 shares at an average price of €125.49, with payouts of approximately €949 million under the\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nprogram in 2023. Repurchased shares will primarily be used to service future awards granted under the ‘Move SAP’ share-based compensation plan.\n\n# Liquidity Management\n\nOur primary source of cash, cash equivalents, and current investments is funds generated from our business operations. Over the past several years, our principal use of cash has been to support operations and our capital expenditure requirements resulting from our growth, to quickly repay financial debt, to acquire businesses, to pay dividends on our shares, and to buy back SAP shares on the open market. On December 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments were primarily held in euros and U.S. dollars. We generally invest only in the financial assets of issuers or funds with a minimum credit rating of BBB, and pursue a policy of cautious investment characterized by wide portfolio diversification with a variety of counterparties, predominantly short-term investments, and standard investment instruments. Our investments in financial assets of issuers with a credit rating lower than BBB were not material in 2023.\n\nWe believe that our liquid assets combined with our undrawn credit facilities are sufficient to meet our operating financing needs in 2024 and, together with expected cash flows from operations, will support debt repayments, currently planned capital expenditure requirements, and capital returns to our shareholders over the near term and medium term. It may also be necessary to enter into financing transactions when additional funds are required that cannot be wholly sourced from free cash flow, to maintain flexibility, and/or limit repayment risk.\n\nTherefore, we continuously monitor funding options available in the capital markets and trends in the availability of funds, as well as the cost of such funding. In recent years, we were able to repay additional debt within a short period of time due to our persistently strong free cash flow. For more information about the financial debt, see the Cash Flows and Liquidity section.\n\n# Credit Facilities\n\nOther sources of liquidity are available to us through various credit facilities, if required. To retain high financial flexibility, we have available a €3.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility with an end date in March 2028 plus two one-year extension options. A possible future utilization is not subject to any financial covenants. So far, we have not used, and do not currently foresee any need to use, this credit facility.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, SAP SE had additional available credit facilities totaling €550 million. Several other SAP entities have credit facilities available that allow them to borrow funds at prevailing interest rates.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Financial Debt\n\nFinancial debt is defined as the nominal volume of bank loans, commercial paper, private placements, and bonds.\n\n# Maturity Profile of Financial Debts\n\n|Year|Variable|Fixed|\n|---|---|---|\n|2024|1,143|1,250|\n|2025|1,100|1,250|\n|2026|1,091|1,000|\n|2027|1,000|800|\n|2028|871|500|\n|2029|91|1,250|\n|2030| | |\n|2031| | |\n\nNominal volume of financial debt on December 31, 2023, included amounts in euros (€7,755 million) and U.S. dollars (€655 million).
