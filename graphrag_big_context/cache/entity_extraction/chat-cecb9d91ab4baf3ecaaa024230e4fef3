The decline in free cash flow in 2024 will be driven predominantly by our preliminary €2.0 billion estimated outflow for restructuring, a €200 million outflow for compliance matters, and a €200 million adverse impact due to the discontinuation of the SAP-triggered financing program.\n\nIn 2024, we intend to repay €850 million in Eurobonds and US$323 million in U.S. private placements. The ratio of net debt as of December 31, 2023, divided by the total of operating profit (IFRS) plus depreciation and amortization was –0.49x and therefore below our 2023 target of 0.5x.\n\n# Non-Financial Goals for 2024 and Ambition for 2025\n\nIn addition to our financial goals, we also focus on four non-financial targets: customer loyalty, employee engagement, carbon impact, and women in executive roles.\n\nFor 2024, SAP expects employee engagement, measured by the Employee Engagement Index, to be between 76% and 80% (2023: 80%). Through 2025, we aim to achieve a steady increase in our Employee Engagement Index score.\n\nSAP measures customer loyalty using the Customer Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS). We expect the score to be between 9 and 13 for Customer NPS in 2024. SAP expects to steadily increase the Customer NPS through 2025.\n\n145/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nIn 2024, we expect to steadily decrease carbon emissions across the relevant value chain. Further, SAP has also committed to achieving net-zero along our value chain in line with a 1.5 degrees Celsius future in 2030.\n\nFrom 2024, SAP will track a new KPI: Women in Executive Roles (WiER). For 2024 and beyond, we are expecting to steadily increase the percentage of women on Global Executive Team, Senior Executive Team, and Executive Team level as we strive to achieve our target of 25% by the end of 2027.\n\n# Premises on Which Our Outlook and Prospects Are Based\n\nIn preparing our outlook and prospects, we have taken into account all events known to us at the time we prepared this report that could influence SAP’s business going forward.\n\n# Outlook for SAP SE\n\nThe primary source of revenue for SAP SE is the license fees it charges subsidiaries for the right to market and maintain SAP software solutions. Consequently, the performance of SAP SE in operating terms is closely tied to the cloud and the software revenue of the SAP Group.\n\nDue to the rise, at constant currencies, in non-IFRS cloud and software revenue anticipated for the SAP Group in 2024, we expect a moderate increase in product revenue for SAP SE.\n\nGiven the Company-wide restructuring program we announced and the projected restructuring expenses at SAP SE level, and assuming that there are no one-time effects relating to acquisitions or to other non-recurring events, we expect SAP SE’s operating profit to decrease significantly.\n\nWe expect that this growth will also result in further revenue and profit growth for SAP SE to the same degree. We expect that SAP SE will continue to receive investment income in the form of profit transfers and dividends from its subsidiaries. The growth we expect for the SAP Group should have a positive effect on this investment income.\n\nThe outlook for the SAP Group in respect to liquidity, finance, investment, and dividend is equally applicable to SAP SE.\n\nAmong the assumptions underlying this outlook are those presented above concerning the economy and our expectations for the performance of the SAP Group.\n\n# Opportunities\n\nOur customers choose SAP as a trusted partner for their digital business transformation. We have established a framework for opportunity management by evaluating and analyzing key areas such as current markets, external scenarios, economic conditions, and technological trends. We have also researched customer and product segmentation, growth drivers, and industry-specific factors for success. These combined insights play a key role for the Executive Board in the development of our market strategies. Our shareholder value relies heavily upon a fine balance of risk mitigation and value-driven opportunities. Therefore, our governance model helps ensure that decisions are based on return, investment required, and risk mitigation.\n\nAs far as opportunities are likely to occur, we have incorporated them into our business plans, our outlook for 2024, and our medium-term prospects outlined in this report. Therefore, the following section focuses on future trends or events that might result in an uplift of our outlook and medium-term prospects should they develop more positively than anticipated in our forecasts.\n\nSAP SE is the parent company of the SAP Group and earns most of our revenue from subscription fees, software license fees, and dividends paid by affiliates. Consequently, the opportunities described below also apply – directly or indirectly – to SAP SE.\n\n# Opportunities from Economic Conditions\n\nEconomic conditions clearly influence our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. Should the global economy recover faster than is reflected in our plans today, our revenue and profit may surpass our current outlook and medium-term prospects. Our medium-term planning considers\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nchanges in market conditions as a result of the ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic environments. Although we continue to be mindful of the negative aspects of this global situation, we take opportunities to further invest into our strategic growth areas. For more information about future trends in the global economy and the IT market outlook, as well as their potential influence on SAP, see the beginning of this Expected Developments and Opportunities section.\n\n# Opportunities Through Innovation\n\nOur continued growth through innovation is based on our ability\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
