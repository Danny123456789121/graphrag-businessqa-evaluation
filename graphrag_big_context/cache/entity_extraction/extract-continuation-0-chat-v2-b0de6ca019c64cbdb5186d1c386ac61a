cover equity-settled and cash-settled awards issued to our employees. The respective expenses are recognized as employee benefits and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities that the receiving employees perform.\n\n# Valuation, Judgment, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nWe use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our share-based payments, including expected share price volatility and expected dividend yields. In addition, the final number of Performance Share Units (PSUs) vesting also depends on the achievement of performance indicators. Furthermore, the payout for cash-settled share units depends on our share price on the respective vesting dates. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ from these assumptions could require material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for these share-based payments. The fair value of the share units granted under the SAP Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020) is dependent on our performance against the total shareholder return (TSR) for NASDAQ-100 companies, the volatility, and the expected correlation between the TSR of the NASDAQ-100 companies and our TSR.\n\nRegarding future payout under our cash-settled plans, the SAP share price is the most relevant factor. With respect to our LTI 2020, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted not only by our share price but also by the relative TSR performance against the NASDAQ-100 companies. Future payouts under our LTI 2020 will also be dependent on meeting non-market-based performance conditions based on SAP’s long-term strategy. The latter, however, is not incorporated into our fair value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity of awards granted. Changes in these factors could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the valuation model, and the future payout.\n\nUnder the OWN SAP share purchase plan, we\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP Group is a multinational software corporation that specializes in enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, with a significant employee headcount across various regions including EMEA, Americas, and APJ.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMEA<|>GEO<|>EMEA refers to the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region where SAP Group operates and has a significant employee presence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAS<|>GEO<|>Americas refers to the region encompassing North and South America where SAP Group has a notable employee presence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APJ<|>GEO<|>APJ stands for Asia Pacific Japan, a region where SAP Group has a considerable employee headcount.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSES<|>EVENT<|>Employee Benefits Expenses refer to the costs incurred by SAP Group for employee salaries, social security, share-based payments, and other related expenses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Share-Based Payments are a form of employee compensation that SAP Group provides, which includes equity-settled and cash-settled awards.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>EMEA<|>SAP Group has a significant employee headcount in the EMEA region, indicating its operational presence there.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>AMERICAS<|>SAP Group has a notable employee presence in the Americas region, indicating its operational activities there.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP GROUP<|>APJ<|>SAP Group has a considerable employee headcount in the Asia Pacific Japan region, indicating its operational activities there.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSES<|>SAP GROUP<|>Employee Benefits Expenses are incurred by SAP Group as part of its operational costs for maintaining its workforce.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS<|>SAP GROUP<|>Share-Based Payments are a component of Employee Benefits Expenses that SAP Group provides to its employees as part of their compensation.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
