Shortly after SAP announced its good results for financial year 2022 at the end of January, the SAP share price rose more than 7% in a single week to €112.58. The successful execution of SAP’s cloud transformation and the resulting improvement in profitability sent clear signals to the market. The positive sentiment solidified over the course of the following months, lifting SAP stock to €115.60 by the time the results for the first quarter were announced. The Q1 numbers and outlook for the full year were once again convincing and pushed the share a further 7% higher to €123.62 within a week. The market already had high expectations for the half-year results at the end of July due to SAP’s performance in the previous quarters, and these expectations were met with the announcement, albeit without providing any further strong stimulus.\n\nWith the results for the crucial third quarter, which once again confirmed the successful execution of SAP’s strategy in terms of order entry, sales revenue, and operating profit, SAP stock began a remarkable upward trend. Within six weeks, the share price climbed to a new all-time high of €148.18 on December 8, 2023, in a supportive market environment. The share ended the trading year on December 29 at a closing price of €139.48, representing an increase of 43.1% compared to the previous year’s closing price. SAP’s market capitalization at the end of December was €171.3 billion, making it once again the most valuable company in the German share index. With our intensified Investor Relations activities in North America, we could drive a strong increase in trading volume of the SAP ADR at the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, SAP was ranked 61st among the 100 most valuable companies in the world according to a study by the management consulting firm EY.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# SAP Stock Versus Major Indices (January 2, 2023, to December 29, 2023)\n\n|SAP Stock (Xetra)|DAX40 Performanceindex (Xetra)|Nasdaq-100 Index|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n\n160%\n\n150%\n\n140%\n\n130%\n\n120%\n\n110%\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n1.

Throughout the year, members of the Executive Board of SAP SE and the Investor Relations (IR) team discussed our latest strategy, its execution and business development, and how SAP was helping customers meet the many challenges faced by companies today, with institutional investors, analysts, and private investors worldwide.\n\nOur event analysis showed that most of the conferences attended consisted of participants with longer investment time horizon and high purchase potential. 85% of the SAP engagements were with asset managers with an investment horizon of 1+ years. The number of days SAP engaged with the buy-side exceeded the industry benchmark and SAP IR interacted with 75% of the Top 100 shareholders throughout the year.\n\nIn summary, the IR team, together with senior management, held more than 300 meetings in 2023 to maintain the dialogue with investors and analysts, including one-on-one phone calls, video conferences, and road shows. Members of the Executive Board and the IR team attended more than 20 conferences across an expanded geographical mix. In May, we hosted the Financial Analyst Conference as a part of our SAP® Sapphire® event in Orlando, Florida, United States. In 2023, for the first time since 2020, SAP held the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) with physical presence again in Mannheim, Germany.\n\nWe continued our dialogue with investors, focusing on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics and providing them with insights into our sustainability policies and products. SAP’s leadership in this area has been recognized by leading sustainability rating organizations.\n\nSAP representatives engaged with retail shareholders at virtual and physical events. The IR team and the Treasury team also maintained regular communication with the debt investor community.\n\nWe provide a wide range of information online about SAP and its stock. Our communications channels include the LinkedIn channel SAP Investor Relations and the SAP INVESTOR magazine. Shareholders\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\ncan reach the IR team directly by telephone hotline and by e-mail at investor@sap.com. We also publish an overview of the latest analyst consensus on the Investor Relations Web site. In addition, we provide a Webcast for all key investor events at which members of our Executive Board speak, and we post all relevant presentations on the Investor Relations Web site.\n\n# Key Facts About SAP Stock/SAP ADRs\n\n# Listings\n\n|Germany|Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart|\n|---|---|\n|United States (ADRs)|New York Stock Exchange|\n\n# IDs and symbols\n\n|WKN/ISIN\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a leading technology company known for its enterprise software solutions, particularly in cloud transformation and financial performance, with a market capitalization of €171.3 billion at the end of December 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASDAQ-100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, reflecting the performance of the technology sector.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Stock Exchange is one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, where SAP's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANNHEIM<|>GEO<|>Mannheim is a city in Germany where SAP held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLANDO<|>GEO<|>Orlando is a city in Florida, United States, where SAP hosted the Financial Analyst Conference as part of its SAP Sapphire event in 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is the country where SAP is headquartered and where it held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYST CONFERENCE<|>EVENT<|>The Financial Analyst Conference is an event hosted by SAP to discuss its strategy and business development with investors and analysts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP SAPPHIRE<|>EVENT<|>SAP Sapphire is an event organized by SAP to showcase its products and engage with customers and investors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>NASDAQ-100<|>SAP's stock performance is reflected in the Nasdaq-100 index, which includes major technology companies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE<|>SAP's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, linking the company to this financial market<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>MANNHEIM<|>SAP held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in Mannheim, Germany, indicating a direct connection between the company and the location<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>ORLANDO<|>SAP hosted the Financial Analyst Conference in Orlando, Florida, showcasing its engagement with investors in this city<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMANY<|>SAP is headquartered in Germany, establishing a strong geographical and operational link<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYST CONFERENCE<|>SAP SAPPHIRE<|>The Financial Analyst Conference is part of the SAP Sapphire event, indicating a relationship between the two events<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
