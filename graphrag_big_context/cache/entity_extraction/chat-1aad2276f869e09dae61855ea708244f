The purchase price was €949 million. The transaction closed on March 5, 2021, following satisfaction of regulatory and other approvals. The Signavio operating results and assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements starting on that date.\n\n# Signavio Acquisition: Recognized Assets and Liabilities\n\n|€ millions| |\n|---|---|\n|Intangible assets|255|\n|Other identifiable assets|73|\n|Total identifiable assets|328|\n|Other identifiable liabilities|108|\n|Total identifiable liabilities|108|\n|Total identifiable net assets|220|\n|Goodwill|729|\n|Total consideration transferred|949|\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nIn general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces. Signavio goodwill was attributed to expected synergies from the acquisition, particularly in the following areas:\n\n- Cross-selling opportunities to existing SAP customers across all regions, using SAP’s sales organization\n- The acquisition of Signavio complements SAP’s business process intelligence offerings and will help create new offerings by combining Signavio products and SAP products, but is also expected to result, for example, in increased SAP S/4HANA and RISE with SAP sales.\n- Improved profitability in Signavio sales and operations\n\nThe allocation of the goodwill resulting from the Signavio acquisition to our operating segments depends on how our operating segments actually benefit from the synergies of the Signavio business combination.\n\n# Clarabridge Acquisition\n\nOn October 1, 2021 (after receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions), Qualtrics completed its previously announced acquisition of Clarabridge, a customer experience management software company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, USA, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger. The number of Qualtrics class A common stock issued to the sellers was fixed based on a valuation of US$1,125 million (subject to certain adjustments) – the assumed Qualtrics share price was US$37.33. The actual consideration transferred (mainly in shares valued at the acquisition date fair value of the common stock) amounted to US$1,298 million (€1,116 million). This includes €910 million of issued shares, €115 million of assumed awards, and €91 million of cash paid.\n\nQualtrics has (1) assumed, amended, and restated Clarabridge stock plans, and (2) converted the assumed options to purchase shares of Clarabridge stock outstanding into corresponding Qualtrics options. Qualtrics has granted equity incentive awards to certain continuing employees of Clarabridge and its subsidiaries under its own Qualtrics equity plan at Qualtrics’ sole discretion.\n\n**Clarabridge Acquisition: Recognized Assets and Liabilities**\n|€ millions| |\n|---|---|\n|Intangible assets|218|\n|Other identifiable assets|84|\n|Total identifiable assets|302|\n|Other identifiable liabilities|107|\n|Total identifiable liabilities|107|\n|Total identifiable net assets|195|\n|Goodwill|921|\n|Total consideration transferred|1,116|\n\nIn general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces. The Clarabridge goodwill consists largely of the synergies that SAP expects to achieve from combining the acquired assets and operations with its existing operations, especially in its Qualtrics subsidiary.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Impact of Business Combinations on Our Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe amounts of revenue and profit or loss of the Signavio and Clarabridge businesses acquired in 2021 since the acquisition date are included in the 2021 consolidated income statements as follows:\n\n# 2021 Acquisitions: Impact on SAP’s Financials (Signavio and Clarabridge)\n\n| |2021|Contribution of 2021 Acquisitions|\n|---|---|---|\n|€ millions|as Reported| |\n|Revenue|27,842|70|\n|Profit after tax|5,376|–89|\n\n1 From continuing and discontinued operations\n\nHad the acquired entities been consolidated as at January 1, 2021, our 2021 revenue and profit after tax would not have been materially different.\n\n# 2021 Divestitures\n\nOn April 13, 2021, SAP and investment company Dediq GmbH, Munich (Germany) (“Dediq”) announced that they had agreed to enter into a partnership in the area of financial services. Following the close of the transaction in September 2021 (after satisfaction of all closing conditions including regulatory approvals), SAP and Dediq jointly own the new SAP Fioneer entity (with SAP owning a minority share).\n\nSAP and SAP Fioneer have executed transition service and go-to-market agreements, among others.
