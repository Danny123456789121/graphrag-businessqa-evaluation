Generative AI could still be described as skill-biased technological change, but with a different, perhaps more granular, description of skills that are more likely to be replaced than complemented by the activities that machines can do.\n\nPrevious generations of automation technology often had the most impact on occupations with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. For lower-wage occupations, making a case for work automation is more difficult because the potential benefits of automation compete against a lower cost of human labor. Additionally, some of the tasks performed in lower-wage occupations are technically difficult to automate—for example, manipulating fabric or picking delicate fruits. Some labor economists have observed a\n\n42 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n“hollowing out of the middle,” and our previous models have suggested that work automation would likely have the biggest midterm impact on lower-middle-income quintiles. However, generative AI’s impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation (Exhibit 13).\n\n# Exhibit 13\n\nGenerative AI could have the biggest impact on activities in high-wage jobs; previously, automation’s impact was highest in lower-middle-income quintiles.\n\n|Wage quintiles|Higher earners|81–100|61–80|41–60|21–40|0–20|Lower earners|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Without generative AI1| |With generative AI|Largest increase in automation adoption from generative AI|Largest automation adoption without generative AI| | | |\n|United States|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|Japan|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|Germany|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|France|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|China|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|India|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|Mexico|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n|South Africa|40|30|20|10|0| | |\n\n1 Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier 43\n\n# Generative AI could propel higher productivity growth\n\nGlobal economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades.15 Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, long-term structural challenges—including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth.\n\nDeclining employment is among those obstacles. Compound annual growth in the total number of workers worldwide slowed from 2.5 percent in 1972–82 to just 0.8 percent in 2012–22, largely because of aging. In many large countries, the size of the workforce is already declining.16 Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 1992 to 2022 (Exhibit 14). However, since then, productivity growth has slowed in tandem with slowing employment growth, confounding economists and policy makers.17\n\n# Exhibit 14\n\nProductivity growth, the main engine of GDP growth over the past 30 years, slowed down in the past decade.\n\n|Real GDP growth contribution of employment and productivity growth, 1972–2022|Productivity growth bigger contributor to GDP growth|\n|---|---|\n|3.8| |\n|3.1|2.5|\n|2.8|2.1|\n|1.4|1.7|\n|0.8| |\n|1972–82|0.7|\n|1982–92|0.8|\n|1992–2002| |\n|2002–12| |\n|2012–22| |\n\nSource: Conference Board Total Economy database; McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nThe deployment of generative AI and other technologies could help accelerate productivity growth, partially compensating for declining employment growth and enabling overall economic growth. Based on our estimates, the automation of individual work activities enabled by these technologies could provide the global economy with an annual productivity boost of 0.5 to 3.4 percent from 2023 to 2040 depending on the rate of automation adoption—with generative AI contributing to 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points of that growth—but only if individuals affected by the technology were to shift to other work activities that at least match their 2022 productivity levels (Exhibit 15). In some cases, workers will stay in the same occupations, but their mix of activities will shift; in others, workers will need to shift occupations.\n\n# Exhibit 15\n\nGenerative AI could contribute to productivity growth if labor hours\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
