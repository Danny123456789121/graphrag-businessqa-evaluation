Finally, from the perspective of the company’s internal green management strategy, this study verifies that the psychological processes of company members related to green issues affect their GSV and GPPO. We also analyzed members’ environmental behavior and performance as well as excluding other behaviors and organizational characteristics that may disturb employees. In future research, we will be able to further explore the perceived organization’s support to the environment and the organization’s impact on the environment’s citizenship behavior [46]. Or, according to Chen, Chang, and Lin [24], starting from the green absorptive capacity of employees, further discuss the issues and determinants that affect employees’ environmental behavior and performance.\n\n# 5.4. Conclusions\n\nAccording to expectancy–valence theory, the psychological process related to green issues affect the background factors controlling the influence of GSV on company members. This study combined insights from PO theory and expectancy–valence theory and presented a psychological process structure. Due to the research gap related to the association between GSV and green management scope, this paper presents a framework that emphasizes how GSV affects the relationship between EGC and EEP through GPPO in the current environmental era. This research explored an extramental mechanism that illustrated the connection between GPPO and relevant variables. The research model indicates that EGC and EEP are affected by the exposure to GSV through an increase in GPPO. A Taiwanese employee sample was used to support the proposed hypotheses. This study provides many important\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\nimplications for guiding managers and decision-making authorities. According to the integrated model of the psychological process of green issues in this study, the assumptions of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory indicate the psychological process of employees’ motivation and psychological ownership. The overall process of an enterprise to effectively strengthen employees’ mentality of green issues is an important key to improving the organization’s green management performance. In the process of improving EEP, companies must not only strengthen the psychological process of employees’ green issues, but reducing EGC is also an important key. Effectively reducing EGC can enable employees to devote themselves to work and contribute to EEP. Therefore, companies should upgrade their GSV to enhance their employees’ GPPO and EEP and decrease their employees’ EGC to achieve corporate sustainability goals.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, T.-W.C.; Data curation, T.-W.C.; Formal analysis, T.-W.C.; Funding acquisition, T.-W.C.; Methodology, T.-W.C.; Resources, T.-W.C.; Writing—review and editing, K.-H.W. and Y.-H.L.
