Software engineers can use generative AI in pair programming and to do augmented coding and train LLMs to develop applications that generate code when given a natural-language prompt describing what that code should do.\n\nSoftware engineering is a significant function in most companies, and it continues to grow as all large companies, not just tech titans, embed software in a wide array of products and services. For example, much of the value of new vehicles comes from digital features such as adaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and IoT connectivity.\n\nAccording to our analysis, the direct impact of AI on the productivity of software engineering could range from 20 to 45 percent of current annual spending on the function. This value would arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system designs. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and capabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study found that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent faster than those not using the tool. An internal McKinsey empirical study of software engineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced the time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work experience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment.\n\nOur analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in productivity that generative AI could bring by improving code or enhancing IT architecture—which can improve productivity across the IT value chain. However, the quality of IT architecture still largely depends on software architects, rather than on initial drafts that generative AI’s current capabilities allow it to produce.\n\nLarge technology companies are already selling generative AI for software engineering, including GitHub Copilot, which is now integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and Replit, used by more than 20 million coders.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# How product R&D could be transformed\n\n# Early research analysis\n\nResearchers use generative AI to enhance market reporting, ideation, and product or solution drafting.\n\n# Virtual design\n\nResearchers use generative AI to generate prompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them to iterate quickly with more design options.\n\n# Virtual simulations\n\nResearchers accelerate and optimize the virtual simulation phase if combined with new deep learning generative design techniques.\n\n# Physical test planning\n\nResearchers optimize test cases for more efficient testing, reducing the time required for physical build and testing.\n\n# Product R&D\n\nGenerative AI’s potential in R&D is perhaps less well recognized than its potential in other business functions. Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with a value ranging from 10 to 15 percent of overall R&D costs.\n\nFor example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nWhile other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply AI in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, can limit their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models that have been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models optimized for a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types of products to which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models lack the capabilities to help design products across all industries.\n\nIn addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate designs, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the following examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring:\n\n- Enhanced design. Generative AI can help product designers reduce costs by selecting and using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can lead to cost reductions in logistics and production.\n- Improved product testing and quality. Using generative AI in generative design can produce a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. Generative AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial phases involving customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing candidates.\n\nWe also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use of which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even greater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI. While we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, we did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product categories. These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the performance of individual\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERIC AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new content, designs, or solutions based on input data, enhancing various fields including software engineering and product R&D.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company known for its software products, including GitHub Copilot, which integrates generative AI to assist software developers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB COPILOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub, integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, designed to assist software developers in writing code more efficiently.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPLIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Replit is an online coding platform used by millions of coders, which incorporates generative AI to enhance coding experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entos is a biotech pharmaceutical company that utilizes generative AI in its research and development processes to design small-molecule therapeutics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI INSIGHTS<|>EVENT<|>AI insights refer to the analytical information derived from AI systems that help diagnose issues and suggest improvements in various fields, including software engineering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>EVENT<|>Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development in a methodical way, which is increasingly enhanced by generative AI technologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R&D<|>EVENT<|>Research and Development (R&D) involves innovative activities undertaken by corporations or governments in developing new services or products, significantly impacted by generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING SURROGATES<|>EVENT<|>Deep learning surrogates are models that can be paired with generative AI to enhance the design and testing processes in various applications.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>GITHUB COPILOT<|>Microsoft developed GitHub Copilot, which uses generative AI to assist software developers in coding tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB COPILOT<|>REPLIT<|>Both GitHub Copilot and Replit utilize generative AI to enhance the coding experience for developers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENTOS<|>GENERIC AI<|>Entos employs generative AI in its R&D processes to design therapeutics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>GENERIC AI<|>Generative AI is increasingly being integrated into software engineering to improve productivity and efficiency<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R&D<|>GENERIC AI<|>Generative AI has the potential to transform R&D processes by accelerating design and testing phases<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING SURROGATES<|>GENERIC AI<|>Deep learning surrogates can enhance the capabilities of generative AI in design and testing<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
