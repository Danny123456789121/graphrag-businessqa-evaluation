Extrapolating globally, 18 percent of work could be automated by AI, with scenarios ranging from 15 to 35 percent, depending on different levels of AI capabilities.\n- Seven percent of US employment would be substituted by AI, and 300 million jobs globally would be exposed to automation, assuming jobs for which at least 50 percent of importance- and complexity-weighted tasks are exposed to automation are likely to be substituted by AI, 10 to 49 percent are likely to be complemented, and less than 10 percent are unlikely to be affected.\n- Generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a ten-year period, assuming that 7 percent of workers are fully displaced but able to find employment at slightly less productive positions, that partially exposed workers increase their productivity, and that roughly half of firms adopt generative AI during that period. Scenarios of productivity growth range from 0.3 to 3.0 percentage points depending on the difficulty level of tasks generative AI could perform, how many jobs are automated, and the speed of adoption.\n- Extrapolating globally, annual productivity growth from generative AI could be 1.4 percentage points over ten years.\n|\n\n# Open AI, OpenResearch, University of Pennsylvania\n\n|Citation|Tyna Eloundou et al., GPTs are GPTs: An early look at the labor market impact potential or large language models, Cornell University arXiv economics working paper, arXiv:2303.10130, March 2023|\n|---|---|\n|Unit of analysis|Skills; occupation groups; industries|\n|Scope|United States|\n|Approach|- Investigate implications of large language models (LLMs) on the United States labor market using three exposure categories (exposure being a measure of whether access to an LLM would reduce the time required to complete a specific detailed work activity or task by at least 50 percent): 1 is no exposure, 2 is direct exposure, and 3 is LLM+ exposure (that is, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM) to reach 50 percent.\n- Exposure was assessed by human annotators and GPT-4.\n|\n|Data collection|- The working paper used the O*NET database (1,016 occupations, 2,087 detailed work activities [DWA], and 19,265 tasks).
