We have found three archetypes for implementing generative AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5\n\nAcross most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs—though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported generative AI uses within respondents’ business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\n\n5 “Technology’s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,” McKinsey, July 11, 2023.\n\n# Exhibit 9\n\nOrganizations are pursuing a mix of off-the-shelf generative AI capabilities and also significantly customizing models or developing their own.\n\n# Strategy for developing generative AI (gen AI) capabilities, % of reported instances of gen AI use1\n\n|Energy and materials|60|40|Significant customization or developed own model|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Technology|56|44|Primarily off the shelf, with little or no customization|\n|Media and telecommunications|54|46| |\n|Consumer goods and retail|50|50| |\n|Financial services|47|53| |\n|Healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical products|47|53| |\n|Advanced industries|42|58| |\n|Business, legal, and professional services|37|63| |\n|Overall|47|53| |\n\n1 Question was asked only of respondents who said their organizations regularly use generative AI in at least 1 business function.

Although it varies by industry, roughly half of our survey respondents say they are using readily available, off-the-shelf gen AI models rather than custom-designed solutions. This is a very natural tendency in the early days of a new technology—but it’s not a sound approach as gen AI becomes more widely adopted. If you have it, your competitor probably has it as well. Organizations need to ask themselves: What is our moat? The answer, in many cases, likely will be customization.\n\nBut even there, the answer is not so simple. The spine and brain of the enterprise of the future will rely on a well-orchestrated mix of multiple foundational models—both off-the-shelf solutions and tools that have been finely tuned to the enterprise’s specific needs. In fact, with gen AI we are moving from a binary world of “build versus buy” to one that might be better characterized as “buy, build, and partner,” in which the most successful organizations are those that construct ecosystems that blend proprietary, off-the-shelf, and open-source models. Finally, leaders must understand that gen AI models generally comprise just 15 percent of any given solution. In other words: it’s not just tech. To create value, organizations must have all the elements in place—domain reimagining abilities; relevant skill sets (including the upskilling of nontechnical colleagues); a robust operating model; proprietary data. It’s only when those factors are in place that organizations will be able to unlock impact and move from experimentation to scale.\n\nAcross most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs—though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own.\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\n\n# Web 2024\n\n# State of AI\n\n# Exhibit 10\n\n# Exhibit 10 of 12\n\nBusiness functions are most often able to put their generative AI capabilities to use within one to four months.\n\nTime for organization to put generative AI capabilities to use, from project launch, % of respondents\n\n| |34| |31|29| |27| |27|25|1–4 months| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|22| |21|22|19| | |5–8 months| | | | |\n|\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
