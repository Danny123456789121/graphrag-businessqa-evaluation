Thus, significant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each company’s needs.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n17\n\n# Potential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following:\n\n- Efficient and effective content creation. Generative AI could significantly reduce the time required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also facilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, writing style, and format. Team members can collaborate via generative AI, which can integrate their ideas into a single cohesive piece. This would allow teams to significantly enhance personalization of marketing messages aimed at different customer segments, geographies, and demographics. Mass email campaigns can be instantly translated into as many languages as needed, with different imagery and messaging depending on the audience. Generative AI’s ability to produce content with varying specifications could increase customer value, attraction, conversion, and retention over a lifetime and at a scale beyond what is currently possible through traditional techniques.\n- Enhanced use of data. Generative AI could help marketing functions overcome the challenges of unstructured, inconsistent, and disconnected data—for example, from different databases—by interpreting abstract data sources such as text, image, and varying structures. It can help marketers better use data such as territory performance, synthesized customer feedback, and customer behavior to generate data-informed marketing strategies such as targeted customer profiles and channel recommendations. Such tools could identify and synthesize trends, key drivers, and market and product opportunities from unstructured data such as social media, news, academic research, and customer feedback.\n- SEO optimization. Generative AI can help marketers achieve higher conversion and lower cost through search engine optimization (SEO) for marketing and sales technical components such as page titles, image tags, and URLs. It can synthesize key SEO tokens, support specialists in SEO digital content creation, and distribute targeted content to customers.\n- Product discovery and search personalization. With generative AI, product discovery and search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images, and speech, and deep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual user preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most relevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow CPG, travel, and retail companies to improve their ecommerce sales by achieving higher website conversion rates.\n\nWe estimate that generative AI could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending.\n\nOur analysis of the potential use of generative AI in marketing doesn’t account for knock-on effects beyond the direct impacts on productivity. Generative AI–enabled synthesis could provide higher-quality data insights, leading to new ideas for marketing campaigns and better-targeted customer segments. Marketing functions could shift resources to producing higher-quality content for owned channels, potentially reducing spending on external channels and agencies.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Generative AI in Sales\n\nGenerative AI could also change the way both B2B and B2C companies approach sales. The following are two use cases for sales:\n\n- Increase probability of sale. Generative AI could identify and prioritize sales leads by creating comprehensive consumer profiles from structured and unstructured data and suggesting actions to staff to improve client engagement at every point of contact. For example, generative AI could provide better information about client preferences, potentially improving close rates.\n- Improve lead development. Generative AI could help sales representatives nurture leads by synthesizing relevant product sales information and customer profiles and creating discussion scripts to facilitate customer conversation, including up- and cross-selling talking points. It could also automate sales follow-ups and passively nurture leads until clients are ready for direct interaction with a human sales agent.\n\nOur analysis suggests that implementing generative AI could increase sales productivity by approximately 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.\n\nThis analysis may not fully account for additional revenue that generative AI could bring to sales functions. For instance, generative AI’s ability to identify leads and follow-up capabilities could uncover new leads and facilitate more effective outreach that would bring in additional revenue. Also, the time saved by sales representatives due to generative AI’s capabilities could be invested in higher-quality customer interactions, resulting in increased sales success.\n\n# Generative AI as a Virtual Collaborator\n\nIn other cases, generative AI can drive value by working in partnership with workers, augmenting their work in ways that accelerate their productivity. Its ability to rapidly digest mountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and options that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. This can significantly speed up the process of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact tasks.\n\nGenerative AI could increase sales productivity by 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# How software engineering could be transformed\n\n# Inception and planning\n\nSoftware engineers and product managers use generative AI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling large volumes of data, such as user feedback, market trends, and existing system logs.\n\n# System design\n\nEngineers use generative AI to create multiple IT architecture designs and iterate on the potential configurations, accelerating system design, and allowing faster time to market.\n\n# Coding\n\nEngineers are assisted by AI tools that can code, reducing development time by assisting with drafts, rapidly finding prompts, and serving as an easily navigable knowledge base.\n\n# Testing\n\nEngineers employ algorithms that can enhance functional and performance testing to ensure quality and can generate test cases and test data automatically.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Maintenance\n\nEngineers use AI insights on system logs, user feedback, and performance data to help diagnose issues, suggest fixes, and predict other high-priority areas of improvement.\n\n# Software engineering\n\nTreating computer languages as just\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate content, analyze data, and assist in various tasks across marketing, sales, and software engineering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKETING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Marketing is a business function that involves promoting and selling products or services, utilizing strategies to reach target audiences effectively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sales is the process of selling products or services to customers, focusing on lead generation, customer engagement, and closing deals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications and systems.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>MARKETING<|>Generative AI can enhance marketing functions by improving content creation, data analysis, and customer engagement strategies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>SALES<|>Generative AI can improve sales productivity by identifying leads and automating follow-ups, thus enhancing client engagement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>Generative AI assists software engineers in coding, testing, and system design, thereby accelerating development processes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKETING<|>SALES<|>Marketing and sales are closely related functions that work together to promote products and convert leads into customers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALES<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>Sales teams often rely on software engineering to develop tools that facilitate customer interactions and improve sales processes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKETING<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>Marketing strategies often require software engineering support to create and maintain digital platforms for customer engagement<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
