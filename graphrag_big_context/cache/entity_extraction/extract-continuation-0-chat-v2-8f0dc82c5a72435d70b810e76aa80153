However, as generative AI continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please see Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).\n\n# Box 1\n\n# How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases\n\nTo assess the potential value of generative AI, we updated a proprietary McKinsey database of potential AI use cases and drew on the experience of more than 100 experts in industries and their business functions. Our updates examined use cases of generative AI—specifically, how generative AI techniques (primarily transformer-based neural networks) can be used to solve problems not well addressed by previous technologies.\n\nWe analyzed only use cases for which generative AI could deliver a significant improvement in the outputs that drive key value. In particular, our estimates of the primary value the technology could unlock do not include use cases for which the sole benefit would be its ability to use natural language. For example, natural-language capabilities would be the key driver of value in a customer service use case but not in a use case optimizing a logistics network, where value primarily arises from quantitative analysis.\n\nWe then estimated the potential annual value of these generative AI use cases if they were adopted across the entire economy. For use cases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some of those in sales and marketing, we estimated the economy-wide value generative AI could deliver by increasing the productivity of sales and marketing expenditures.\n\nOur estimates are based on the structure of the global economy in 2022 and do not consider the value generative AI could create if it produced entirely new product or service categories.\n\n1 “Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.\n\nIn this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: business function and modality.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Value potential by function\n\nWhile generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3). Our analysis of 16 business functions identified just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately 75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.\n\n# Exhibit 3\n\nUsing generative AI in just a few functions could drive most of the technology’s impact across potential corporate use cases.\n\n| |Impact, $ billion| | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| |500|Sales|Represent ~75% of total annual impact of generative AI|\n|400| |Marketing| |\n| |300|Software engineering (for corporate IT)| |\n|200| | |Customer operations|\n| |100|Product R&D1| |\n|0|Supply chain| | |\n|0|Manufacturing| | |\n|0|Finance| | |\n|0|Risk and compliance| | |\n| |0|Talent and organization (incl HR)| |\n|0|Procurement management| | |\n|0|Corporate IT1| | |\n|0|Legal| | |\n|0|Strategy| | |\n| |0|Pricing| |\n\nNote: Impact is averaged.\n\n1Excluding software engineering.\n\nSource: Comparative Industry Service (CIS), IHS Markit; Oxford Economics; McKinsey Corporate and Business Functions database; McKinsey Manufacturing and Supply Chain 360; McKinsey Sales Navigator; Ignite, a McKinsey database; McKinsey analysis\n\nNotably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent in our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, is now much lower.7 This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which exclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers for previous applications of AI.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Generative AI as a virtual expert\n\nIn addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in function-specific use cases, the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal knowledge management systems. Generative AI’s impressive command of natural-language processing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries in the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This could empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make better-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.\n\nIn 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about a fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly “read” vast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source material in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable solution than hiring a team of human experts for the task.\n\n# Operational benefits of generative AI\n\nFollowing are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual expert in a handful of use cases.\n\nIn addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in specific use cases, the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal knowledge management systems.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# How customer operations could be transformed\n\n# Customer self-service interactions\n\nCustomer interacts with a humanlike chatbot that delivers immediate, personalized responses to complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand voice regardless of customer language or location.\n\n# Customer–agent interactions\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that provides insights and analysis on economic trends and the impact of technology, including generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can create content, solve problems, and enhance creativity across various industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOX 1<|>EVENT<|>Box 1 is a section in the document that discusses how the value potential of generative AI use cases was estimated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER OPERATIONS<|>FUNCTION<|>Customer operations is a business function that could be significantly impacted by generative AI, particularly in enhancing customer interactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKETING AND SALES<|>FUNCTION<|>Marketing and sales are business functions that could see substantial value from the implementation of generative AI technologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>FUNCTION<|>Software engineering is a business function that could benefit from generative AI, particularly in corporate IT applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<|>FUNCTION<|>Research and development is a business function that could leverage generative AI to drive innovation and efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL ECONOMY<|>GEO<|>The global economy refers to the interconnected economies of countries around the world, which could be impacted by the adoption of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The McKinsey Global Institute conducts research on the economic potential and applications of generative AI technologies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>BOX 1<|>Box 1 discusses the methodology used by McKinsey to estimate the value potential of generative AI use cases<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>CUSTOMER OPERATIONS<|>Generative AI has the potential to transform customer operations by enhancing self-service and agent interactions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>MARKETING AND SALES<|>Generative AI could significantly increase productivity in marketing and sales functions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>Generative AI can improve software engineering processes, particularly in corporate IT<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<|>Generative AI can drive innovation in research and development functions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL ECONOMY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The adoption of generative AI across industries could have a significant impact on the global economy<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
