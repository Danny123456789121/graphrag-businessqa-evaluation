The wind-down of business operations in Russia and Belarus was nearly completed in the first quarter of 2023 and remaining contract obligations were reduced to a non-material volume by the end of the year.\n\nAfter two years of significant investments to accelerate SAP’s transition to the cloud (the so-called phase one), the second phase of our cloud transformation started in January 2023 with the publication of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. At that time, SAP showed the passing of the tipping point towards positive profitability (non-IFRS), as planned and predicted in the strategy update that was communicated in October 2020.\n\nContinuous execution along the midterm ambition and forthcoming positive results over the remaining quarters in 2023 underpinned SAP’s commitment to the corporate strategy. The focus on efficiencies and disciplined spending resulted in a significant expansion of its cloud gross margins (non-IFRS) throughout the year.\n\nSAP has been an early adopter of AI technology. During the SAP Sapphire conference in May, the Company showcased the use of AI in various products. At the beginning of the second half of 2023, the Company announced strategic direct investments in three leading generative AI companies. The investments underscore SAP’s open ecosystem approach to AI, which is aimed at leveraging the best technology to embed AI across SAP’s portfolio. The Company anticipates significant possibilities for market expansion through these technologies and new premium offerings.\n\n# Overall Financial Position\n\n# Executive Board’s Assessment\n\nGiven the macroeconomic environment outlined above, the course of business was again favorable for SAP in 2023.\n\nNoteworthy is the strong momentum in our cloud business: cloud revenue was up 20%, reaching €13.7 billion. SAP’s current cloud backlog (CCB) exceeded €13.7 billion, an increase of 25%. Total revenue increased 6% to €31.2 billion, and IFRS operating profit decreased slightly to €5.8 billion. Non-IFRS operating profit increased 9% to €8.7 billion. Free cash flow increased 16% to €5.1 billion.\n\nRegarding SAP’s non-financial performance, we met our initial outlook ranges for all three of our most important non-financial performance indicators: the Customer Net Promoter Score increased 6 points to 9 (initial outlook: 8 to 12), the Employee Engagement Index remained unchanged at 80% (initial outlook: 76% to 80%), and our net carbon emissions continued to decrease, dropping 85 kt to 0 kt (initial outlook: 0 kt).\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nOn this basis, we are confident we can deliver on our financial and non-financial outlook for 2024 and on our updated 2025 ambition.\n\n# Performance Against Our Outlook for 2023 (Non-IFRS)\n\nAs in previous years, our 2023 operating profit-related goals and published outlook were based on our non-IFRS financial measures at constant currencies. For this reason, in the following section we discuss performance against our outlook in terms of non-IFRS numbers, unless otherwise stated, (at constant currencies) derived from IFRS measures. The subsequent section about International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) operating results discusses numbers only in terms of IFRS, so the numbers in that section are not expressly identified as IFRS numbers.\n\n# Outlook for 2023 (Non-IFRS)\n\nThe initial outlook for 2023, including Qualtrics (for more information, see the table Comparison of Outlook and Results for 2023), expected full-year cloud revenue to range between €15.3 billion and €15.7 billion, and cloud and software revenue to range between €28.2 billion and €28.7 billion, with more predictable revenue anticipated to make up 83% of this result. Furthermore, we expected operating profit (non-IFRS) to range between €8.8 billion and €9.1 billion and a free cash flow of approximately €5.0 billion. We expected a full-year 2023 effective tax rate (IFRS) of 28.0% to 32.0% (2022: 32.0%) and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 26.0% to 28.0% (2022: 29.6%), strongly depending on the development of Sapphire Ventures’ investments. This initial outlook reflected SAP executing on its cloud strategy, which is driving the accelerated cloud growth through both new business and cloud adoption by existing customers, scaling SAP’s cloud momentum towards its midterm ambition.\n\nIn April 2023, we adjusted our outlook for continuing operations, reflecting the expected Qualtrics divestiture. We thereafter expected cloud revenue to range between €14.0 billion and €14.4 billion, cloud and software revenue to range between €26.9 billion and €27.4 billion, and operating profit (non-IFRS) to range between €8.6 billion and €8.9 billion.
