The Committee adopted a total of three resolutions by correspondence vote. In two sessions in January 2023, the Committee dealt with the renewal of Scott Russell and Julia White’s Executive Board contracts, and with the introduction of compensation for the Lead Independent Director after it had become apparent that this role involves considerable additional time and effort. In addition, the Committee consented to the secondary employment of an Executive Board member and examined the German Federal Labor Court’s ruling on SAP’s Employee Involvement Agreement. The Committee approved, by way of correspondence vote, the conclusion of a consulting contract by Luka Mucic. Following his departure from the SAP Supervisory Board at the end of March 2023, Luka Mucic was to remain a member of the Qualtrics Executive Board until SAP had fully divested Qualtrics. The consulting contract was to serve as the legal basis for this membership. When it met in April, the Committee resolved an update to the contractual non-compete clause in Executive Board contracts that was to be introduced in connection with the conversion of those contracts to the new compensation system. In addition, the Committee dealt with the search for candidates to replace Sabine Bendiek as head of the Executive Board’s HR portfolio. The Committee subsequently agreed on the candidate proposed by the Supervisory Board for this portfolio when it met in July. As well as discussing various compensation matters, the Committee's October 25, 2023, meeting focused particularly on a change in the non-IFRS definition for fiscal 2024 and on the creation of a new Supervisory Board office.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\nextraordinary meeting on December 6, 2023, to deliberate on the candidate to be proposed to the Supervisory Board as a new Executive Board member for the Product & Engineering area. It came to the conclusion that Muhammad Alam was its favorite candidate. In January 2024, the Committee prepared the Supervisory Board’s resolution to elect Muhammad Alam to the Executive Board effective April 1, 2024, once the details of his Executive Board contract had been negotiated. The proposed resolution took into account the new SAP Executive Board structure that was announced on January 9, 2024.\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee held 12 meetings in 2023 – two of which jointly with the Finance and Investment Committee and two jointly with the Technology and Strategy Committee. Said schedule included one telephone conference per quarter to vote on the quarterly reporting, and one session per quarter to address regular and topical agenda items. In addition, in November and December 2023, the Committee resolved both times internally on the System and Organization Controls (SOC). The SOC involves software-related certifications and risk analyses that enable companies to conduct an impartial investigation in accordance with a framework established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which the companies and their customers both require in the context of their financial reporting.\n\nIn its ordinary meetings, the Committee also had the opportunity to engage with the auditor without the Executive Board present, which was an integral part of the meeting agenda. The Committee comprehensively prepared the resolutions of the Supervisory Board for all topics assigned to it, as described above. Regular agenda items included the course of business in the respective quarter, the accounting processes, the preparation of end-of-quarter closings, and the quarterly reports due for publication. In addition, the Committee chairperson was in regular contact with the auditor. Other recurring meeting topics included the monitoring of SAP’s risk management system, internal control system, non-financial reporting, and compliance system (including specific compliance issues, the status of corresponding SAP-internal investigations, and case-related collaboration with authorities).\n\nThe Committee also dealt regularly with the monitoring of SAP’s cybersecurity processes that the Executive Board had established and continually optimizes to ensure compliance of all activities in this area. At its February 2023 meeting, the Committee prepared the Supervisory Board’s resolutions on the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group for 2022 in the run-up to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, which were adopted by the Supervisory Board at the audit meeting. Other material topics dealt with by the Committee beyond the regular meeting topics in its ordinary meetings and those described in the “Sustainability” section of this report included quarter-specific matters and the amendments to the non-IFRS definition for fiscal 2024.\n\nFurther, the Committee monitored the progress of selected lawsuits involving SAP. The Audit and Compliance Committee also received regular updates on how BDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (BDO) was performing its tasks as the new auditor for SAP’s financial statements and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Committee continually monitored the quality of the auditor and the management report. To this end – in addition to evaluating satisfaction surveys for the prior year’s audit by the previous auditor – the Committee obtained and referred to the report from the current auditor on its internal quality assurance standards and to any material findings from internal quality audits, external quality controls, and peer reviews, and from any investigations conducted by the government or regulators into the auditor's audits.\n\nAt its meeting in July, the Committee discussed the audit focus for 2023 with the auditor. As reported in more detail below, the Committee also held two joint meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee in February and December 2023 to discuss the Group annual plan for 2023 and the preliminary Group annual plan for 2024. The joint meetings with the Technology and Strategy Committee in April and October focused on SAP’s cybersecurity framework, which had been enhanced based on the results of the assessment by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, a department of the U.S. Department of Commerce). Beyond this, the Committees reviewed the status of the SOC certifications for fiscal 2023, and the Audit and Compliance Committee approved the certification services to be provided by BDO.
