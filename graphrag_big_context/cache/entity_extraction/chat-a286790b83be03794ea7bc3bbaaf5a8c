Please refer to GRI 3-3 for the main types of work-related ill health. The identification of work-related hazards that pose a risk of ill health (such as via the BHCI or the Run Healthy program), as well the actions taken to eliminate/ minimize these hazards and risks, are outlined in GRI 403-1 to GRI 403-7. Internally, we track and monitor an SAP illness rate (in %) which is defined as the total number of days absent (including absences shorter than 3 days) / scheduled workdays per year (250 days) x 100. In 2023, SAP had a global illness rate of 2.1%. We do not break the illness rate down into different categories due to the low risk of specifically work-related illnesses. Therefore, we only track an overall illness rate. In 2023, our Stress Satisfaction Score evaluation confirmed lower stress levels on average compared to satisfaction. Furthermore, we leverage the company reports from our external Employee Assistance Program (EAP) providers to recognize health trends and to derivate appropriate actions. For non-employee workers, we require our suppliers and sub-suppliers to uphold health and safety standards via our Global Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, in Germany we have safety Instructions for contractors in place.
