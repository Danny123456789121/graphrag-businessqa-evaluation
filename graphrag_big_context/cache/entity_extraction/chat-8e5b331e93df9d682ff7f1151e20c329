The emissions are extrapolated based on the number of server units in data centers and office space with an air conditioning (A/C) system (100% data coverage). All refrigerants are assumed to be HFC134a.\n- Mobile Combustion in Corporate Cars: Emissions from fuel combustion of company cars. In the context of carbon reporting, the term ‘company car’ refers to all cars for which SAP permanently covers the fuel costs. Emission calculation is based on fuel consumption. If detailed fuel data is not available in specific countries, stable values (liters/car) are used for extrapolation based on the number of company cars reported. The stable values for extrapolation are based on the previous year’s carbon emissions data.\n- Refrigerants in Corporate Cars: HFC emissions caused by air conditioning devices in company cars (fuel and electric cars). Refrigerant emissions are based on an estimate of HFC1234yf emissions per car (in Europe) and HFC134a emissions per car (for the rest of the world) and are extrapolated based on the number of corporate cars reported (100% data coverage).\n- Mobile Combustion in Corporate Jets: Emissions caused by business trips with SAP-owned or chartered jets. Emission calculation for SAP’s jets is based on actual fuel consumption (100% data coverage).\n\n# Scope 2\n\nRefers to indirect carbon emissions and is defined as emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, purchased steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from the organization. To determine SAP’s global net emissions, we use the location-based method to calculate the Scope 2 emissions. To calculate the market-based Scope 2 emissions, we have applied a regional EAC portfolio approach (see Renewable Electricity below). At SAP, the following emission categories are covered by Scope 2:\n\n- Electricity in Office Buildings: Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity in office buildings. Calculation of emissions is based on building electricity consumption. CO2e conversion factors are updated annually based on country-specific grid factors. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m2) based on the previous year’s energy consumption data are used for extrapolation.\n- Electricity in SAP-Owned Data Centers: Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity in SAP-owned and -operated data centers. The calculation of emissions is based on data center electricity consumption (100% data coverage). COe conversion factors are updated annually based on country-specific grid factors.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Electricity in Co-Location Data Centers\n\nEmissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity in co-location data centers. A co-location is a local computing center where the building infrastructure is controlled and managed by an external provider but where SAP has control over the operations of the network and server infrastructure on which SAP software is running. CO2e conversion factors are updated annually based on country-specific grid factors. Electricity consumption for co-location data centers is calculated based on the consumed server power and a power usage effectiveness (PUE) factor. Where no data is available, average factors are applied.\n\n# E-Mobility\n\nEmissions from company cars with electric drive. Electricity consumption is calculated based on the number of e-cars per country, an average energy consumption value for e-cars, and an average mileage per year. Emissions calculation is based on country-specific emission factors (100% data coverage).\n\n# Home Office Electricity\n\nEmissions caused by end-user IT equipment used by SAP employees working from home. Due to the high number of employees working from home (flexible hybrid working model, Pledge to Flex) we started to report the electricity emissions of IT equipment usage outside of the office in 2022. Per employee, an average equipment usage consisting of a notebook, monitor, and mobile phone is considered. For each of these hardware device types, the model that is primarily used by SAP employees is taken into account to determine the average electricity consumption per hour. Average daily usage, charging hours, and stand-by hours are additionally considered when calculating the electricity consumption of an employee in home office. The information about the share of home office per location is determined based on the latest commuting survey conducted in 2022 (see Employee Commuting). Emission calculation is based on country-specific emission factors.\n\n# Purchased Chilled and Hot Water and Steam\n\nEmissions caused by the consumption of purchased heat or steam in office buildings (district heating). Calculation of emissions is based on consumption of district heating. Emission factors are updated annually. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m2) based on the previous year’s energy consumption data are used for extrapolation.\n\n# Scope 3\n\nRefers to other indirect carbon emissions, and is defined as emissions that are a consequence of operations of an organization but are not directly owned or controlled by the organization. Scope 3 emissions are divided into upstream and downstream emissions.\n\n# Upstream\n\nOnly selected upstream emissions are included in our target to be carbon neutral in our own operations in 2023. The following upstream Scope 3 carbon emissions are included in our carbon neutrality 2023 target:\n\n# Business Flights\n\nEmissions caused by business trips by airplane. Calculation of emissions is based on actual distance traveled and actual costs spent. This data is used to determine an average emission factor per euro spent based on short, medium, and long-haul flight emission factors. For CO2e calculation, this factor is applied to actual costs for business flights. Emission factors for business flights do not consider the radiative forcing factors.\n\n# Rental Cars\n\nEmissions caused by business trips\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
