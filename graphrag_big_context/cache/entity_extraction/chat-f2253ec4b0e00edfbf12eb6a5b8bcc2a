It attributes this development to strong private consumption and the support of resilient labor markets.\n\nConcerning the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) region, the euro area economy grew minimally over the first half of 2023, reports the ECB. In the second half of the year, real GDP contracted slightly, mostly due to a decline in inventories but also because of subdued confidence, low competitiveness, renewed geopolitical tensions, and tighter financing conditions. However, services activity grew modestly and contributed positively to growth in the second half of the year.\n\nIn the Americas region, U.S. economic growth showed more resilience than previously anticipated. Despite significant tightening of monetary policy, the United States showed a solid domestic demand and a strong labor market and, with significant government spending, reached a robust growth, states the ECB.\n\nAs for the APJ (Asia Pacific Japan) region, Chinese economic activity stabilized in 2023, driven by stronger consumer spending. The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions at the beginning of the year and a broader recovery in private consumption compensated for weakness in the Chinese residential sector. In Japan, however, real GDP growth contracted in 2023, as high inflation weighed on activity and consumption. However, growth returned to a slightly positive yet modest territory in the fourth quarter, states the ECB.\n\n# The IT Market\n\n“The digital business era has arrived. Spending on digital technologies is growing while traditional, nondigital spending is stagnating or even slightly dropping. The demand for digital experiences from customers, employees, partners, and suppliers has shifted to an expectation. Companies looking to sustain and grow are seeking digital revenue streams while looking to digitize operations to reduce costs and increase efficiency.” This is how International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.-based market research firm, summarizes the current IT market situation. Therefore, reports IDC, “in the post-pandemic environment, digital-first strategies have moved from being a competitive advantage to being the basic standard needed for survival. Legacy systems are increasingly proving to be bottlenecks, hindering real-time data access and agile response mechanisms. In contrast, businesses that have embraced digital transformation are reaping the benefits of adaptability and more insightful data-driven decision-making.”\n\nIn particular, IDC finds that “the technology within a digital business platform is essential for driving the innovation and new revenue streams that companies are looking for in the digital business era” and that “more digitally mature organizations with established digital business platforms are better able to compete in an increasingly digital world.” That is because these “autonomous business processes evolve the nature of information from intelligence to insights to immediate decisive actions. These advances, when utilized, give organizations a competitive advantage in speed, scale, and agility and will transform them into truly digital businesses.”\n\n“Today’s SaaS and cloud-enabled applications are packed with generative AI (GenAI), artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), microservices, APIs, and automated workflows,” explains IDC, and elaborates: “The convergence of AI, automation, and analytics signals a transformative era in digital business. As these technologies have matured, they offer organizations unprecedented capabilities to drive innovation, optimize processes, and uncover actionable insights. This isn’t just about adopting\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nnew tools; it’s a major shift toward ‘deep intelligence’ and automation, bringing agility and an insight-driven approach to the center of digital enterprises.”4\n\nA major topic, according to IDC, is sustainability: “ESG factors are swiftly emerging as critical determinants of a company’s long-term value. In today’s business climate, ESG considerations are no longer just a checklist. […] These are factoring in and becoming integral components to a company’s strategic plans.”4 In IDC’s view, therefore, “sustainability is increasingly linked to digital business […]. Digital technology spending can be both directly and indirectly dedicated to sustainability initiatives, either by specifically addressing corporate-sponsored endeavors or by establishing the platform necessary to eventually carry out sustainability goals.”2 IDC assesses that “organizations are increasingly turning to applications that can help them meticulously monitor and report their activities as well as achieve real-world sustainability milestones.”3\n\n1 European Central Bank, Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2023, Publication Date: January 11, 2024.\n\n2 IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Digital Business Strategies 2024 Predictions, Doc #US50120323, October 2023.\n\n3 IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Intelligent ERP 2024 Predictions, Doc #US51300923, October 2023.\n\n4 IDC FutureScape: Worldwide CIO Agenda 2024\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
