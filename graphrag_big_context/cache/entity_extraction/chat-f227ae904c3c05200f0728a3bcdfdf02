principal and interest, we take an investment-by-investment decision whether to classify as FVTPL or FVOCI.\n\nThe valuation of equity securities of private companies requires judgment because it is typically based on significant unobservable inputs, as no market prices are available and there is inherent lack of liquidity.\n\nWe take the most recent qualitative and quantitative information aspects into consideration to determine the fair value estimates of these equity securities.\n\nConsiderable judgment and assumptions are involved with regard to the selection of appropriate comparable company data, the assessment of cash requirements of the business, the acceptance of the technology or products in the addressable markets, the actual and forecasted performance, the milestone achievements, the adequacy of price points from financing rounds, the transaction of similar securities of the same company, the rights and preferences of the underlying securities, the selection of adequate equity allocation parameters, the possible exit scenarios and associated weightings.\n\nBecause all of these assumptions could change significantly, and because valuation is inherently uncertain, our estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had market prices for the investments existed and that will ultimately be realized, and those differences could be material.\n\nGains/losses on equity securities at FVTPL include gains/losses from fair value fluctuations, from disposals as well as dividends, while gains/losses on equity securities at FVOCI only include dividends, all of which are shown in Financial income, net. Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at the trade date.\n\n# Equity Investments\n\n|€ millions|Non-Current|Current|Total|Non-Current|Current|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Equity securities|0|4,967|4,967|0|5,138|5,138|\n|Investments in associates|0|135|135|0|151|151|\n|Equity investments|0|5,102|5,102|0|5,289|5,289|\n|Other financial assets|3,344|5,543|8,887|853|5,626|6,479|\n|Equity investments as % of Other financial assets|0|92|57|0|94|82|\n\n206/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Investments in Associates\n\nSAP has interests in a number of individually immaterial associates.
