These include cross-business topics and the evaluation of risks related to compliance, bribery, and corruption. Overall, our corporate risk assessments focus on compliance topics. In addition, 38% of all audits concluded in 2023 under the risk-based audit plan are compliance-relevant audits. As part of this process, a regular and dedicated focus is also placed on identifying high-risk countries so as to identify deep dive reviews and necessary mitigations accompanied by regular monitoring. Furthermore, ad hoc audits are performed if there are grounds of suspicion. This regular auditing is a vital component of ensuring compliance worldwide in our business processes and identifying weaknesses or non-compliance to derive adequate measures. Given the holistic approach of our compliance risk assessment, SAP does not report on the number of audits solely related to corruption.\n\n205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures\n\nSAP’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (CoEBC) provides the primary ethical and legal framework within which SAP conducts business. It also addresses SAP’s policies regarding anti-corruption. The CoEBC is available internally on the Company’s intranet and externally on the Internet. All members of the SAP Executive Board and Supervisory Board, all SAP employees, all SAP partners, suppliers, and shareholders, as well as the general public, have full access to the CoEBC. We do not collect the data of the geographical distribution and the type of our business partners who access the CoEBC. For a breakdown of the geographical distribution of all SAP employees, see the Report Data Hub. The completion rate for mandatory training applicable to all SAP employees on the subject of anti-corruption exceeded 99% in 2023. The numbers of employees per region are listed below:\n\n- APJ: 21,465\n- Greater China: 6,595\n- EMEA: 13,221 (includes five Executive Board Members)\n- MEE: 33,446\n- LAC: 5,805\n- North America: 21,325 (includes two Executive Board members)\n\nExcludes employees on long-term sick leave, parental leave, members of acquired companies, and those in early retirement.\n\n299/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n|GRI Standards|Disclosure Title|Links, Content, and Omissions|In Scope of External Audit|UN SDGs| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|205-3|Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken|Of all cases, only material corruption cases are reported in Note G.3.|SAP|16| |\n|GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behavior 2016|206-1|Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices|Of all cases, only material legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices cases are reported in Note G.3.|SAP|16, 17|\n|207-1|Approach to tax|SAP Global Tax Principles|SAP|9, 11, 16| |\n|207-2|Tax governance, control, and risk management|SAP Global Tax Principles|SAP|9, 11, 16| |\n|207-3|Stakeholder engagement and management of concerns related to tax|SAP Global Tax Principles|SAP|9, 11, 16| |\n|207-4|Country-by-country reporting|As a German company, we report our tax expense separately for Germany and for the rest of the world.
