When it met in October, the Committee revisited the topic of performance management, particularly in view of the upcoming global rollout of the new concept. Moreover, the Committee discussed SAP’s plans to require more in-office presence of its staff.\n\n– The Nomination Committee met five times in 2023. On January 15, 2023, for example, the Committee discussed potential candidates for election to the Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2023. In particular, the Committee members discussed the potential successor to Hasso Plattner as Supervisory Board chairperson, ultimately deciding that Punit Renjen was their preferred candidate. When it met again on January 25, the Committee resolved its final recommendation to the Supervisory Board to elect Jennifer Li, Qi Lu, and Punit Renjen to the Supervisory Board. Since four Supervisory Board members will reach the end of their term of office in 2024, the Committee spent its August 2023 meeting deliberating on candidates for re-election or election as new members. It also discussed the skills that Hasso Plattner’s successor should possess, and agreed that the person should have extensive technology knowledge. Based on the process it had agreed upon in August for nominating candidates, the Committee met again in October 2023 to agree on how to approach the ones they had shortlisted. On December 6, 2023, the Committee agreed on the candidates to be proposed to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2024 for the Supervisory Board seat being vacated by the departing Hasso Plattner.\n\n– The Go-To-Market and Operations Committee likewise met four times in the reporting year. At the Committee’s meeting in February, the Executive Board presented its marketing plans for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition as well as its planned changes to the internal go-to-market concept for 2023 target achievement, particularly with regard to roles and incentives. In April 2023, the Executive Board presented a plan designed to further improve the measurable usage of our software by customers and simultaneously increase demand, especially in the cloud environment. In addition, the largest planned events for the remainder of the year were presented. When the Committee met in July 2023, the Executive Advisory Board, an advisory body comprised of managers from more than 20 SAP customers from various regions and industries, presented feedback on the customer journey – that is, on the individual phases that a customer goes through before the purchase and until after the delivery of a product. In addition, the Executive Board presented a growth plan aimed at boosting growth and ensuring constant pipeline population – that is, the number of software sales that are lined up. The last item discussed at this meeting was a status report presented on new customer acquisition, also in comparison to SAP’s peers. The Committee’s meeting in October reviewed an update on the growth plan presented to it in July and discussed the further expansion of SAP’s partner network.\n\nThe work of the committees and their regular reports in the plenary sessions ensured that we were kept fully informed of all matters covered by the committees and were able to discuss them thoroughly.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board and of the Executive Board had no conflicts of interest that recommendations E.1 and E.2 of the CGCG require to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board. Rather, they were avoided by the Supervisory Board member concerned not taking part in the relevant discussions or voting on the matter in question in the event of a possible, selective conflict of interest. Insofar as Supervisory Board members hold executive positions in companies or have material equity in companies that currently have business dealings with SAP, we do not see any impairment of their independence. The scope of the business relationships in question is relatively small and, moreover, the transactions take place at arm’s length.\n\n# Training and Professional Development\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board were once again offered various training and professional development opportunities throughout the year, with appropriate support from the Company. Where it made sense, presentations and training offerings were recorded and placed on a specially configured training platform to enable the remaining Supervisory Board members to take part in them as well.\n\n24/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\nMembers of the Audit and Compliance Committee were invited to a short seminar in April 2023 on “Current aspects of non-financial reporting.” In May 2023, a course on “Innovation at SAP” was offered that focused on AI, large language models (models that are trained on huge data volumes), and on the metaverse, a digital space that is created by interacting with virtual, augmented, and physical reality. In November, several Supervisory Board members took part in a virtual deep dive on Customer Experience at SAP. On-boarding courses and leaflets are available for new Supervisory Board members to familiarize themselves with their tasks and responsibilities when they assume office. New members also have the opportunity to meet individually with members of the Executive Board to discuss the topics relevant to their new portfolio.\n\n# SAP SE and Consolidated Financial Reports for 2023\n\nBDO audited the SAP SE and consolidated financial reports for 2023. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 18, 2022, elected BDO as the SAP SE and SAP Group auditor for fiscal year 2023. The Supervisory Board had proposed the appointment of BDO on the recommendation of the Audit and Compliance Committee. Prior to the proposed resolution being put to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, BDO had confirmed to the chairperson of the Supervisory Board\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
