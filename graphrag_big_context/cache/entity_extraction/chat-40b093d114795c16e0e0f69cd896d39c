Organizations leveraging technology, satellite imagery, or other tools to increase transparency, protection and/or understanding of the restored area are preferred.\n\n# Calculation\n\nIn the net carbon emissions relevant for our carbon neutrality target, purchased offsets are already deducted from our gross emissions. When our net carbon emission became a short-term Incentive KPI of the Executive Board compensation, we defined and documented a multi-year carbon offsetting plan (which is part of the annual independent audit procedures) to prevent misusage.\n\nIn 2023, the voluntary investments in our carbon project portfolio (see the Energy and Emissions section) were used to compensate for the remaining emissions of the following emission categories which could not be avoided nor reduced:\n\n- Scope 1: Stationary combustion in facilities, refrigerants in facilities, mobile combustion and refrigerants in corporate cars, mobile combustion in corporate jets\n- Scope 2: Purchased chilled and hot water and steam\n\n289/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n– Scope 3: Business flights, rental cars, train travel, business trips with private cars, employee commuting, and logistics. For our science-based target (net zero by 2030), we do not consider carbon offsets (beyond value chain mitigation) in line with the Science-Based Target initiative’s Corporate Net-Zero Standard.\n\n# Total Energy Consumed\n\nWe define total energy consumed as the sum of all energy consumed in SAP’s own operations (Scope 1 and 2), including energy from renewable sources. It is calculated based on the consumption data obtained through our measurements for the carbon emissions and is the sum of energy consumption from stationary combustion in facilities, mobile combustion in company cars, mobile combustion in corporate jets, electricity in offices, electricity in own data centers, purchased chilled water, purchased hot water, and purchased steam, and electricity in co-location data centers (see Data Center Electricity).\n\n# Data Center Electricity\n\nWe define data center electricity as the sum of electricity consumed to provide internal and external computation power in SAP-owned data centers and contracted third-party data centers (co-locations). A data center is any global, regional, or local computing center (location with any number of server units) that is part of our global IT infrastructure strategy. Hyperscale data centers are not part of our own operations and are therefore not reflected in this disclosure. Internally, we calculate the electricity consumption of hyperscale services as basis to determine the required procurement of EACs to ensure that SAP software solutions running on hyperscale data centers are powered with 100% renewable electricity.\n\n# Additional Environmental Aspects\n\n# Water Usage\n\nBy water usage, we mean the total amount of freshwater withdrawn for our office buildings and data centers. Data is based on measurements and estimations from sites. Data was provided for 84.7% of the total water consumption; the remaining data is extrapolated based on square meter footage.\n\n# E-Waste Management\n\nWaste of Electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE / e-waste)85 means all the discarded electrical and electronic devices. These ranges from end-user IT equipment such as laptops, peripherals, and mobile devices to compute, to networking and storage devices of our data centers. Our international and local IT asset lifecycle partners test the collected WEEE to determine the correct treatment. We define the possible streams as follows:\n\nWaste diverted from disposal:\n\n1. Reusage (top priority): Refurbishing and reselling functioning devices to give it a second life\n2. Recycling (second priority – previously called “mechanical recycling”): Extracting raw materials to preserve and reuse them (such as plastics, metals, and rare earths)\n\nWaste directed to disposal:\n\n1. Incineration with and without energy recovery (previously called “thermal recycling”), whereby the former refers to the generation of energy through the incineration of waste\n2. Landfill: Disposing of waste on a landfill site (we strive to avoid this treatment as much as possible)\n\n85 The former categorization (Reusage vs. WEEE) has been replaced by a new structure aligned with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) E5 and still aligns with EU Directive 2008/98/EC & EU Directive 2012/19/EU. “Reusage” is included in WEEE and there are two sub-categories: “Waste diverted from disposal” and “Waste directed to disposal”. New terminology has also been implemented in alignment with ESRS E5 (specified in the text).\n\n290/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Calculation of E-Waste with Treatment Insights\n\nThe e-waste data we receive from our large IT asset lifecycle partners is based on weight or the number of devices which is converted into weight based on an average weight of the devices. To determine the share of end-of-life treatment practices (recycling versus incineration with/without energy recovery versus landfill), our partners aim to use the specific quotas of the recycling sites. If this data is not available, regional quotas or other available country quotas are used for approximation. We also collect reusage data from ISO 14001-certified SAP locations that are not (fully) covered by our large IT asset lifecycle partners. This amount is included in the reusage data visualized in the Waste and Water section.\n\nIn 2023, an analytical reporting sourcing system was developed and implemented to improve assessment and management, gain clear insights in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
