In our Global Environmental Policy, we made the commitment to strive towards zero e-waste in our own operations by diverting close to 100% from incineration, landfill, and nature by 2030. As such, we cooperate with international and local IT asset lifecycle partners to reuse and recycle our e-waste. We also engaged with them to improve their sustainability roadmap – helping to reach our own sustainability target for 2030 – as well as with the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact (CNDCP) Circularity working group to define sustainability measures and find new levers to drive positive change forward. By the end of 2023, we had reused 56% and recycled 37% (total: 93%) of our total WEEE. For more information about the accounting of our WEEE, see the Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance section.\n\n78 The link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor included in the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n79 The link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor included in the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# E-Waste Treatment Tons\n\n|Waste diverted from disposal|840|558|1398|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Waste directed to disposal|78 25 103|78 25 103|78 25 103|\n\n# Cutting Down Residual Waste Within Own Operations\n\n# Implemented Measures and Initiatives\n\nElimination of single-use plastics: Based on three principles ‘reduce waste, reuse items, and recycle materials’, we continued to collaborate with suppliers, service providers, partners, the internal global network of sustainability champions, and other stakeholders to eliminate single-use plastic products such as bottles, cups, stirrers, straws, cutlery, and food packaging. For example, in Barcelona we reduced plastic bottles in the employees’ daily lives by providing water filters for their own homes.\n\n# Improve waste segregation and reduce residual waste\n\n- We continued our waste separation initiative by installing 55 further waste separation systems in the flexible workspaces in Walldorf and St. Leon-Rot.\n- The office furniture and equipment from vacated seats and floors was reused in several sites.\n- The global printing volume remained at a low level: 12.5 million pages (increase of 18% versus 2022; decrease of 74% versus 2019).\n- ‘Too Good to Go’ app installed in selected German cafeterias enabled employees to pick up leftover lunches for a small fee to combat food waste. In 2023, more than 3,000 meals were saved.\n- There is a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) process in our headquarters in which organic waste is used to generate biogas.\n- An Indoor Smart Composting System was installed in Budapest (Hungary) and an Organic Waste Converter was installed in Bangalore (India) to process the organic waste generated in the office.\n\n# Assessment of our suppliers and partners\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a WEEE treatment compliant assessment of a selected range of key upstream suppliers and downstream asset lifecycle partners:\n\n- Upstream: 56% of servers and data storage products already comply with eco-design and hazardous waste requirements.\n- Downstream: 94% of servers and data storage products undergo preparation for re-use, recovery, or recycling operations, or for proper treatment, including removal of all fluids and selective treatment.\n\nWith the results of our yearly assessments for our Taxonomy-related disclosures, we would also like to sensitize those suppliers who are not yet compliant to further develop their products and services in accordance with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy.\n\n# Using Water Efficiently\n\nClimate change affects – and is affected by – global water resources and management. This is why we continue to aim to use water as efficiently as possible in our data centers and offices even though our operations are not water-intensive. In 2023, the water usage decreased compared to 2022 and remains at a lower level compared to the pre-pandemic situation due to the introduced flexible working mode and our implemented water-reduction measures.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Global Water Usage\n\n|1,332|Thousand cubic meters|\n|---|---|\n|988| |\n|878| |\n|765| |\n|710| |\n\n# Implemented Measures and Initiatives\n\n# Water management efforts in SAP-owned data centers\n\n- We completed a robust and comprehensive climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify physical climate risks that are material to SAP’s owned data centers. The results were discussed with relevant stakeholders from SAP and four climate hazards were selected for in-depth analysis, including “water stress.” The vulnerability of data centers to any of the priority hazards has been assessed.\n- In our headquarters, we use adiabatic cooling (evaporative cooling) and closed water circuits to minimize water consumption for cooling our server racks. In 2023, we installed an adiabatic cooling system in Bangalore (India).\n- In Colorado Springs (USA), we use free air cooling in the colder winter season and leverage a non-potable water system in the warmer months. By increasing the programmed outside temperature set point that determines when the sumps are filled with water, we were able to improve our water usage efficiency (WUE).\n- Based on our water risk-assessment for our ISO 14001-certified sites: twenty percent of these sites are located in high to extremely high water-risk regions. In 2023, we enabled access\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a global software company that focuses on enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, committed to sustainability and reducing e-waste by 2030.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE NEUTRAL DATA CENTRE PACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact (CNDCP) is an initiative aimed at promoting sustainability measures in data centers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUDAPEST<|>GEO<|>Budapest is the capital city of Hungary where an Indoor Smart Composting System was installed to process organic waste.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANGALORE<|>GEO<|>Bangalore is a city in India where an Organic Waste Converter was installed to manage organic waste generated in the office.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO SPRINGS<|>GEO<|>Colorado Springs is a city in the USA where SAP employs free air cooling and a non-potable water system to enhance water usage efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEEE<|>EVENT<|>WEEE refers to Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, which SAP aims to manage sustainably by reusing and recycling e-waste.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>CLIMATE NEUTRAL DATA CENTRE PACT<|>SAP collaborates with the CNDCP to define sustainability measures and drive positive change in data centers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUDAPEST<|>SAP<|>SAP installed an Indoor Smart Composting System in Budapest to process organic waste<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANGALORE<|>SAP<|>SAP installed an Organic Waste Converter in Bangalore to manage organic waste<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLORADO SPRINGS<|>SAP<|>SAP uses innovative cooling systems in Colorado Springs to improve water usage efficiency<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>WEEE<|>SAP is committed to managing WEEE by striving towards zero e-waste in its operations<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
