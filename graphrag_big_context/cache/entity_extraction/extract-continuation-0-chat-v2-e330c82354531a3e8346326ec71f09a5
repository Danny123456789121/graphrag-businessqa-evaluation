And while it has not yet been comprehensively measured, it is essential that we monitor and manage it.\n\nAI developers recognize the necessity of minimizing AI’s environmental footprint, especially in the context of expanding the use of AI—and are already working to make algorithms and data centers more energy efficient and to increase their commitment to renewables. For instance, in terms of clean energy utilization, several organizations such as the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) in the US, RE-Source in the EU, and the Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) in APAC (each with members including prominent tech players) are actively advocating for the acceleration and facilitation of access to carbon-free energy for corporate buyers in various regions.\n\n37 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Leaders could:\n\nPromote transparency of AI’s environmental impact and potential via pragmatic reporting guidelines and standards.\n\n# Examples:\n\nThe European Code of Conduct for Data Centres is an initiative led by the European Joint Research Centre. Since 2020, this initiative has regularly released annual guidelines and ambitious voluntary standards aimed at promoting energy efficiency best practices within data centers. These guidelines encompass recommendations pertaining to energy consumption, as well as environmental measurement and reporting.\n\nSpain’s National Green Algorithms Plan seeks to raise awareness among AI developers of the energy consequences of their design decisions—and to draw attention to more sustainable choices through the development of standards and tools to measure the energy consumption of algorithms.\n\nThe German Bundestag has amended its Energy Efficiency Act, which includes specific regulations for data centers and provisions concerning the incorporation of renewable energy sources into data center energy portfolios, standards for Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), and mandates for the reuse of heat generated by data centers.\n\n# Encourage AI technology providers to make robust sustainability and clean energy commitments—and to adopt climate-friendly development best practices.\n\n# Examples:\n\nThe 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact was introduced during the High-level Dialogue on Energy in 2021. The participants in the Compact—both Member States and non-state entities—committed to a set of principles that will lead to energy policies, technologies, procurement practices, and solutions that transform the broader energy ecosystem with the goal of achieving a carbon-free energy grid.\n\nThe Climate Neutral Data Center Pact is a self-regulatory initiative that includes 100+ data center operators and trade associations to make data centers in Europe climate neutral by 2030.\n\n# Facilitate the adoption of sustainable practices for AI operations by supporting investment to reduce AI’s environmental impact and removing barriers to clean technology adoption (for example, reforming planning for energy infrastructure, market rules, etc.).\n\n# Examples of access to clean energy:\n\nThe European Commission is working to establish an ambitious target to increase the renewables share of its energy mix to more than 40% by 2030, while in the US, the Biden administration has set an ambitious goal to achieve a 100% carbon-free electricity sector by 2035. These overarching frameworks instill confidence among investors, fostering the growth of clean energy industries.\n\nGovernments across Europe (including the UK, Norway, and Estonia) and elsewhere (such as South Africa, Brazil, and India) employ competitive auctions for sourcing clean energy—an approach that offers distinct advantages over more traditional fixed-price subsidies (for example, feed-in tariffs).\n\n# Examples of access to clean tech:\n\nThe US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 offers tax incentives and other financial rewards for purchasing equipment that reduces and/or sequesters carbon.\n\nThe EU’s Green Deal Industrial Plan of 2023, among other initiatives, provides funding to accelerate the growth of Europe’s clean tech industry.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# Promote the Socially Responsible Use of AI for Climate\n\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, AI introduces several social risks that require mindful management to ensure the benefits of AI for climate are broadly shared.\n\nFor example, one significant concern is bias within AI models, where skewed or limited training data can lead to biased outcomes. For instance, if climate-related algorithms do not consider the specific context and needs of the communities most affected, biased model output will hold back progress. Additionally, there are regional disparities. The Global South faces more climate challenges, while AI expertise and infrastructure remain predominantly concentrated in the Global North. This disparity can limit access to AI-driven solutions where they are needed most. Moreover, AI’s potential for misinformation poses a threat to informed climate discourse, as the technology can be exploited to influence public perception. Lastly, data privacy and security must be a priority, as AI applications entail the handling of sensitive information, and breaches could have severe consequences.\n\n# Leaders could:\n\nEngage widely with all stakeholders to develop and communicate principles for socially responsible AI, addressing such factors as fairness, inclusiveness, safety, and data privacy.\n\n# Examples:\n\nUNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI features 10 principles that define a human-rights-centered approach to AI development, including do-no-harm, data protection, human oversight, and non-discrimination. Similarly, the OECD AI Principles, adopted in 2019, define five key principles for an AI that is innovative and trustworthy and respects human rights and democratic values. In the US, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights identifies five principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems, as well as a handbook to move from principle to practice. The European High-Level Expert Group on AI has developed Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.\n\n# Create assessment frameworks\n\nto measure the alignment of AI applications with socially responsible principles.\n\n# Example:\n\nThe AI Verify Foundation, an initiative of Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority, offers a framework and tools to assess AI applications along key ethical dimensions such as safety, security, and fairness.\n\n39\n\nACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\nKeeping warming to below the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target will
