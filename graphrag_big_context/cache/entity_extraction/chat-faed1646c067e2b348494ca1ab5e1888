With generative AI’s enhanced natural-language capabilities, more of these activities could be done by machines, perhaps initially to create a first draft that is edited by teachers but perhaps eventually with far less human editing required. This could free up time for these teachers to spend more time on other work activities, such as guiding class discussions or tutoring students who need extra assistance.\n\nOur previously modeled adoption scenarios suggested that 50 percent of time spent on 2016 work activities would be automated sometime between 2035 and 2070, with a midpoint scenario around 2053. Our updated adoption scenarios, which account for developments in generative AI, model the time spent on 2023 work activities reaching 50 percent automation between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint of 2045—an acceleration of roughly a decade compared with the previous estimate (Exhibit 8).\n\n# Exhibit 8\n\nThe midpoint scenario at which automation adoption could reach 50 percent of time spent on current work activities has accelerated by a decade.\n\n|Global automation of time spent on current work activities, %|100|Updated early scenario including generative AI|Updated late scenario including generative AI| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|80| | |2017 early scenario|2017 late scenario| | | | |\n| |60|Midpoint 2017|50%| | | | | |\n|40|Midpoint updated| | | | | | | |\n| | |20| | | | | | |\n|0|2020|2030|2040|2050|2060|2070|2080|2090|\n\n1 Includes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world. 2017 estimates are based on the activity and occupation mix from 2016. Scenarios including generative AI are based on the 2021 activity and occupation mix.\n\nEarly scenario: aggressive scenario for all key model parameters (technical automation potential, integration timelines, economic feasibility, and technology diffusion rates).\n\nLate scenario: parameters are set for later adoption potential.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Different countries, different pace of adoption\n\nAdoption is also likely to be faster in developed countries, where wages are higher and thus the economic feasibility of adopting automation occurs earlier. Even if the potential for technology to automate a particular work activity is high, the costs required to do so have to be compared with the cost of human wages. In countries such as China, India, and Mexico, where wage rates are lower, automation adoption is modeled to arrive more slowly than in higher-wage countries (Exhibit 9).\n\n# Exhibit 9\n\nAutomation adoption is likely to be faster in developed economies, where higher wages will make it economically feasible sooner.\n\n|Automation adoption by scenario for select countries, %|United States|Germany|Japan|France|China|Mexico|India|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Early scenario|100|100|80|80|60|60|50%|\n|Late scenario|40|40|20|20|0|0| |\n\n1 Early scenario: aggressive scenario for all key model parameters (technical automation potential, integration timelines, economic feasibility, and technology diffusion rates).\n\n2 Late scenario: parameters are set for the later adoption potential.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nOur analyses of generative AI’s impact on work activities and the pace of automation adoption rely on several assumptions and sensitivities (see Box 4, “Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities”).\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Box 4\n\n# Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities\n\nThis analysis considers the potential for developing automation technologies. It does not account for how those work activities may shift over time or forecast new activities and occupations.1 Also, the analysis accounts solely for first-order effects. It does not take into account how labor rates could change, and it does not model changes in labor force participation rates or other general equilibrium effects. That said, while these models account for the time it may take for technology to be adopted across an economy, technologies could be adopted much more rapidly in an individual organization. Other research may reach different conclusions.\n\nOur assessments of technology capabilities are based on the best estimates of experts involved in the role of small and midsize enterprises around the world, in addition to the challenges of incorporating and managing change in larger organizations.\n\nIn addition, this analysis does not assume that the scale of work automation equates directly to job losses. Like other technologies, generative AI typically enables individual activities within occupations to be automated, not entire occupations. Historically, the activities in many occupations have shifted over time as certain activities are automated. However, organizations may decide to realize the benefits of increased productivity by reducing employment in some job categories, a possibility we cannot rule out.\n\nGenerative AI is likely to have the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation.\n\n1 David Autor et al., New frontiers: The origins and content of new work, 1940–2018, National Bureau of Economic Research working paper number 30389, August 2022; Jeffrey Lin, “Technological adaptation, cities, and new work,” Review of Economics and Statistics, May 2011, Volume 93, Number 2.\n\n# Generative AI’s potential impact on knowledge work\n\nPrevious generations of automation technology were particularly effective\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
