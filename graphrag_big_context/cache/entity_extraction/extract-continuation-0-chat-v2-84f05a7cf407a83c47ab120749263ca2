Thus, RSKIND is a dummy variable that is set to 1 if the firm sector is in the list of environmental risky industries, and is set to 0 otherwise.\n\nGrowth opportunities (GOPP) is proxied by Tobin’s q which is calculated as the ratio between firm’s market value plus debt, and firm’s accounting value, as usual in the literature (Villalonga and Amit, 2006). Return on assets (ROA) proxies for firm’s profitability. Finally,\n\nalso as common in the literature, natural logarithm of firm’s total assets is used as proxy for firm’s size (SIZE). In equations (1) and (2), i refers to firm; t is related to period; dt is the error term related to time-specific effects; ai is the error term associated with firm-specific effects (which includes unobservable firm-specific characteristics); and mi,t is the random error term.\n\nAlternate models [equation (2)] include the variable firm debt (DEBT), being measured by the ratio of total debt over total assets. These logit panel data models (for all measures of ownership concentration) are estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms, for which debt emerges as an important control variable commonly mentioned in the literature.\n\nCSPi;t = b0 + b1 OWNCi;t + b2 RSKINDi;t + b3 ROAi;t + b4 SIZE + b5 GOPPi;t + b5 DEBTi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (2)\n\nModels are estimated using panel data logistic regression model (“xtlogit” command in STATA). Panel data methodology allows the treatment of unobservable heterogeneity associated with fixed firm effects which are those specific firm attributes that do not change over time.
