types of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, which are classified as either amortized cost (AC), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For those financial instruments measured at fair value or for which fair value must be disclosed, we have categorized the financial instruments into a three-level fair value hierarchy depending on the inputs used to determine fair value and their significance for the valuation techniques.\n\n# Fair Values of Financial Instruments and Classification Within the Fair Value Hierarchy\n\n|€ millions|Category|Measurement Categories|Fair Value|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Assets| | | |\n|Cash and cash equivalents| | |8,124|\n|Cash at banks1|AC|3,369|3,369|\n|Time deposits1|AC|2,277|2,277|\n|Money market and similar funds|FVTPL|2,478|2,478|\n|Trade and other receivables| | |6,525|\n|Trade receivables1|AC|5,775|5,775|\n|Trade receivables1|FVOCI|122|122|\n|Other receivables2|－|628| |\n|Other financial assets| | |8,887|\n|Debt securities|AC|129|129|\n|Equity securities|FVTPL|4,967|4,967|\n|Investments in associates2|－|135| |\n|Time deposits|AC|3,021|3,021|\n|Financial instruments related to employee benefit plans2|－|244| |\n|Loans and other financial receivables|AC|300|300|\n|Derivative assets| | | |\n|Designated as hedging instrument| | | |\n|FX forward contracts|－|33|33|\n|Interest rate swaps|－|0|0|\n|Not designated as hedging instrument| | | |\n|FX forward contracts|FVTPL|52|52|\n|Call options for share-based payments|FVTPL|0|0|\n|Call option on equity shares|FVTPL|5|5|\n|Liabilities| | |–1,822|\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n#\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
