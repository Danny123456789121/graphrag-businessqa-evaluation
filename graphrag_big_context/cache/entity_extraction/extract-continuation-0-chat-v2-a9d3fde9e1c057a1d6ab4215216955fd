A small group of high performers lead the way.\n\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey and McKinsey Digital.\n\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using—and deriving business value from—this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents’ expectations for gen AI’s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\n\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI—most notably, inaccuracy—as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\n\n# AI Adoption Surges\n\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents’ organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1 Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2\n\n# Exhibit 1\n\nExhibit 1 of 12\n\nAI adoption worldwide has increased dramatically in the past year, after years of little meaningful change.\n\n|Organizations that have adopted AI in at least 1 business function, % of respondents|100|\n|---|---|\n|Adoption of AI|80|\n| |72|\n| |60|\n|58|56|\n|50|50|\n|65|47|\n| |40|\n|Use of generative AI|33|\n| |20|\n| |20|\n|0|0|\n\n0 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n\nIn 2017, the definition for AI adoption was using AI in a core part of the organization’s business or at scale. In 2018 and 2019, the definition was embedding at least 1 AI capability in business processes or products. Since 2020, the definition has been that the organization has adopted AI in at least 1 function.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 1,363 participants at all levels of the organization, Feb 22–Mar 5, 2024\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nOrganizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption.\n\nIncludes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\n\n# Exhibit 2\n\nSurvey findings suggest that organizations are using AI in more business functions now than in previous years.\n\n|Business functions at respondents’ organizations that have adopted AI, % of respondents|2021|2022|2023|2024|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1 or more functions|100| | | |\n|2 or more functions|90| | | |\n|3 or more functions| | | | |\n|4 or more functions|80| | | |\n|5 or more functions|70|72| | |\n| |60| | | |\n| |50|50| | |\n| |40| | | |\n| |30|27| | |\n| |20| | | |\n| |10|8| | |\n| |0| | | |\n\n1 In 2021, n = 1,843; in 2022, n = 1,492; in 2023, n = 1,684; in early 2024, n = 1,363.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 1,363 participants at all levels of the organization, Feb 22–Mar 5, 2024\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n# The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\n\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value. Most respondents now report that their organizations—and they as individuals—are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year.
