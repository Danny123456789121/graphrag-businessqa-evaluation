Management’s view of these matters may also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and claims may differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods, which could result in a material impact on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, or reputation. Most of the lawsuits and claims are of a very individual nature and claims are either not quantified by the claimants or the claim amounts.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nquantified are, based on historical evidence, not expected to be a good proxy for the expenditure that would be required to resolve the case concerned. The specifics of the jurisdictions where most of the claims are located further impair the predictability of the outcome of the cases. Therefore, it is typically not practicable to reliably estimate the financial effect that these lawsuits and claims would have if SAP were to incur expenditure for these cases.\n\nFurther, the expected timing of any resulting outflows of economic benefits from these lawsuits and claims is typically uncertain and not estimable, as it depends generally on the duration of the legal proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve them.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including proceedings and claims that relate to companies we have acquired. We will continue to vigorously defend against all claims and lawsuits against us. The provisions recorded for these claims and lawsuits as at December 31, 2023, are neither individually nor in the aggregate material to SAP.\n\n# Among the claims and lawsuits disclosed in this Note are the following\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXECUTIVE BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Executive Board is responsible for the overall management and strategic direction of SAP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERVISORY BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Supervisory Board oversees the Executive Board and ensures that the company is managed in the best interests of shareholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is a continent where SAP operates and has a significant market presence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITIGATION<|>EVENT<|>Litigation refers to the legal proceedings involving SAP, including intellectual property-related claims and other legal contingencies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXECUTIVE BOARD<|>SAP<|>The Executive Board manages SAP and is responsible for its strategic decisions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPERVISORY BOARD<|>SAP<|>The Supervisory Board oversees the activities of the Executive Board to ensure proper governance of SAP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LITIGATION<|>SAP<|>SAP is involved in various litigation cases that arise in the ordinary course of its business<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPE<|>SAP<|>SAP operates extensively in Europe, which is a key market for its software solutions<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
