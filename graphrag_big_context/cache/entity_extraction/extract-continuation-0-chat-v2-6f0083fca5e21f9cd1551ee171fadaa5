They are initially measured at acquisition cost and subsequently amortized based on the expected consumption of economic benefits over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to 20 years.\n\nJudgment is required in determining the following:\n\nâ€“ The useful life of an intangible asset, as this is based on our estimates regarding the period over which the intangible asset is expected to generate economic benefits to us\n\nâ€“ The amortization method, as IFRS requires the straight-line method to be used unless we can reliably determine the pattern in which the assetâ€™s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by us\n\nBoth the amortization period and the amortization method have an impact on the amortization expense that is recorded in each period.\n\n# Classification of Intangibles\n\nWe classify intangible assets according to their nature and use in our operations. Software and database licenses consist primarily of technology for internal use, whereas acquired technology consists primarily of purchased software to be incorporated into our product offerings.
