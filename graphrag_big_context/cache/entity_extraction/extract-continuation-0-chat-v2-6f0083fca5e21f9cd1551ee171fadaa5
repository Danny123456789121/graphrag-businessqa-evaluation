They are initially measured at acquisition cost and subsequently amortized based on the expected consumption of economic benefits over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to 20 years.\n\nJudgment is required in determining the following:\n\n– The useful life of an intangible asset, as this is based on our estimates regarding the period over which the intangible asset is expected to generate economic benefits to us\n\n– The amortization method, as IFRS requires the straight-line method to be used unless we can reliably determine the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by us\n\nBoth the amortization period and the amortization method have an impact on the amortization expense that is recorded in each period.\n\n# Classification of Intangibles\n\nWe classify intangible assets according to their nature and use in our operations. Software and database licenses consist primarily of technology for internal use, whereas acquired technology consists primarily of purchased software to be incorporated into our product offerings. Customer relationships and other intangibles consist primarily of customer relationships and acquired trademark licenses.\n\nAmortization expenses of intangible assets are classified as Cost of cloud, Cost of services, Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administration, depending on the use of the respective intangible assets.\n\n# Intangible Assets\n\n|€ millions|Software and Database Licenses|Acquired Technology|Customer Relationships and Other Intangibles|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Historical cost 1/1/2022|833|2,996|6,734|10,563|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences|8|170|337|515|\n|Additions from business combinations|0|65|98|163|\n|Other additions|244|0|65|309|\n|Retirements/disposals|–115|–703|–92|–910|\n|Transfers|87|–1|–85|1|\n|12/31/2022|1,057|2,527|7,057|10,641|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences|–1|–65|–185|–251|\n|Additions from business combinations|0|121|355|476|\n|Other additions|22|3|59|84|\n|Retirements/disposals|–92|–767|–2,307|–3,166|\n|Transfers|87|0|–87|0|\n|12/31/2023|1,073|1,819|4,892|7,784|\n\n203/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n|Accumulated amortization|1/1/2022|547|2,398|3,653|6,598|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences| |7|137|171|315|\n|Additions amortization| |99|209|458|766|\n|Retirements/disposals| |–109|–703|–61|–873|\n|12/31/2022| |544|2,041|4,221|6,806|\n|Foreign currency exchange differences| |–1|–57|–118|–176|\n|Additions amortization| |146|77|305|528|\n|Retirements/disposals| |–95|–477|–1,307|–1,879|\n|12/31/2023| |594|1,584|3,101|5,279|\n\n# Carrying amount\n\n|12/31/2022|513|486|2,836|3,835|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|12/31/2023|479|235|1,791|2,505|\n\n# Significant Intangible Assets\n\n|€ millions, unless otherwise stated|Carrying Amount|Remaining Useful Life|\n|---|---|---|\n|Concur – Customer relationships|588|7 to 11|\n|LeanIX - Customer relationships|345|13|\n|Callidus – Customer relationships|147|9|\n|Signavio – Customer relationships|178|13|\n|Total significant intangible assets|1,258|1,068|\n\n# (D.4) Property, Plant, and Equipment\n\n# Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment are typically depreciated using the straight-line method.
