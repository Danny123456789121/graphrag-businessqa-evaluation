This was the case in three of the plenary sessions and in eight committee meetings in 2023. In addition, the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives independently discussed, at times with the CEO, the topics on the respective agenda before each ordinary meeting. Said deliberations similarly took place as required prior to the extraordinary meetings or prior to circular correspondence votes. The Supervisory Board addressed the following key topics during the year:\n\n# Artificial intelligence\n\nOne of the main focuses of our discussions with the Executive Board was the topic of artificial intelligence (“AI”). SAP is working intensively to integrate AI in its software solutions to allow customers to reap the enormous potential of using AI. The Supervisory Board supports and continually monitors this process and the measures associated with it. At our meeting on February 22, 2023, for example, the Technology and Strategy Committee reported on how the Executive Board had explained SAP’s AI strategy and its bearing on SAP’s product portfolio to it. When the Supervisory Board met on April 13, 2023, the Executive Board presented the Company’s innovation plans in the field of AI and outlined how SAP would integrate certain AI applications into its products. Our plenary session and committee meetings in July 2023 were held in San Martin, California, USA. These sessions and the supporting program likewise dealt with AI, and included expert presentations covering various aspects of this technology. When the Technology and Strategy Committee met in July 2023, it reviewed the\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nimplementation of SAP’s enterprise AI strategy and examined the framework conditions for data consumption by AI applications. SAP’s AI strategy was also the subject of intense debate at the plenary meeting in July 2023. Among other things, our discussions focused on the go-to-market strategy and SAP’s current and future investments to expand its AI portfolio. In addition, management explained to us its plans for building up additional AI expertise among SAP’s workforce. The Go-to-Market and Operations Committee analyzed the success of the go-to-market measures for AI at its October meeting.\n\n# Cloud Transformation\n\nSAP’s transformation to a cloud company continued to be the subject of ongoing dialog between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in 2023. We consulted in-depth with the Executive Board on the key initiatives and measures in the Company’s cloud transformation strategy and monitored its implementation. In our April meeting, we examined the challenges in public cloud. When it met in October, the Finance and Investment Committee reviewed SAP’s strategy to realign the product and service portfolio and discussed the cloud gross margin with the Executive Board. The Go-To-Market and Operations Committee likewise dealt with the cloud transformation in the reporting year, specifically the go-to-market strategy and related sales model. In our plenary session on October 26, 2023, the full Supervisory Board and the Executive Board reviewed in-depth the planned second phase of the cloud transformation, including the related goals and implementation measures. In this connection, we also discussed with the Executive Board its proposals for a new Executive Board structure, which it deemed necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the next phase of the transformation and the proposed efficiency measures. The Supervisory Board places great importance on being fully informed about the further cloud transformation, so that it can constructively support its implementation.\n\n# New Government Security Committee\n\nThe rise in legal requirements in the context of national security and geopolitical developments are becoming increasingly important for SAP as a software provider for the public sector and as an operator of critical infrastructures. The Supervisory Board discussed, on several occasions in 2023, matters relating to the national security of states in which SAP is subject to corresponding regulations. From the Supervisory Board’s perspective, it was essential that a committee on government security be set up to reflect SAP’s business activities in these security-sensitive areas. The Supervisory Board will therefore, in accordance with the legal framework, accompany and monitor these specific Company activities by means of a dedicated committee going forward. The Personnel and Governance Committee discussed the formation of and rules of procedure for this committee at its April 12 and July 26, 2023, meetings and thereafter reported on its deliberations to the full Supervisory Board. The new six-member Government Security Committee was subsequently established, its rules of procedure adopted, and its members elected during the October meeting of the Supervisory Board. The Committee began its work in January 2024.\n\n# Sustainability\n\nDue to the comprehensive strategic importance that sustainability has for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUNIT RENJEN<|>PERSON<|>Punit Renjen is a member of the Supervisory Board and has been involved in discussions regarding the company's strategies and operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTINE REGITZ<|>PERSON<|>Christine Regitz is a member of the Supervisory Board, participating in key discussions and decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
