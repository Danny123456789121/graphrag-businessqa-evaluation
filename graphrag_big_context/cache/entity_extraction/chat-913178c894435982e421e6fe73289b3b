Against outflows of €2,395 million associated with the payment of the dividend and €960 million for the repurchase of stock in treasury, there was a €4,766 million increase due to net income for 2022 and €995 million from the issuance of treasury stock to serve the share-based payments of employees. The equity ratio (that is, the ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets) is 33% (2022: 28%).\n\nProvisions increased €436 million to €2,846 million (2022: €2,410 million). Other provisions increased €437 million to €2,091 million (2022: €1,654 million), primarily as a result of an increase in other obligations toward employees and provisions for stock-based compensation. Provisions for tax remained at €741 million (2022: €741 million).\n\nLiabilities decreased €4,084 million to €28,951 million (2022: €33,036 million). This decrease mainly resulted from a decrease in liabilities to financial institutions of €2,380 million due to scheduled repayments of bank loans (€1,450 million) and commercial papers (€930 million), the scheduled repayment of bonds in the total amount of €1,600 million, and a decrease of €218 million in trade payables. In contrast, other payables increased €143 million.\n\nThe statements made for the SAP Group in respect to Capital Structure, Capital Expenditures and Liquidity are mainly equally applicable to SAP SE.
