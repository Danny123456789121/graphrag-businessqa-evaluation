To validate this pre-assessment, we additionally consulted internal experts and collected their views.\n\nWhile the likelihood and severity of impact scenarios and the financial, strategic, and regulatory relevance of a topic to SAP’s business success and resilience had changed in a few instances, the overall list of material topics according to HGB and GRI had not.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Materiality section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor.\n\n267/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Why Holistic Steering and Reporting Matters\n\nGlobal crises and challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, rising societal inequalities, ongoing wars, and the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the urgent need for corporate accountability and value creation beyond financial performance.\n\nExpectations of our stakeholders are still rising in this context: Customers ask us to help them in their sustainability transformation; employees expect SAP to be a truly purpose-driven company; investors demand disclosure of not only financial performance but also environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance for their investment decisions; and governments around the globe increasingly implement ESG-related regulations, taxes, and policies.\n\nConnecting financial and non-financial ESG metrics is key to comprehensively analyzing all dimensions of a company’s performance and working toward their integration and harmonization. On this journey, digital technologies play a fundamental role in delivering embedded, validated, and real-time data.\n\nIn addition to the perspective of connecting financial and non-financial ESG metrics, holistic steering and reporting integrates the dimensions of positive and negative impacts that businesses create along their complete value chain.\n\nOur corporate sustainability approach is to create positive economic, social, and environmental impact within planetary boundaries.\n\n# Our Journey Toward Sustainable Impact\n\nAt SAP, we have been measuring our progress holistically and connecting financial and non-financial data since 2012, when we merged our sustainability and annual reports into an integrated report.\n\nIn 2019, SAP became a founding member of the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA) to contribute our experience to support the development of a standardized methodology along with 27 other like-minded, multinational companies. The VBA helps companies, investors, and other stakeholders integrate and compare non-financial performance based on the concept of impact.\n\nWe strive to embed impact measurement in our corporate and relevant business unit decision-making and target-setting. Holistic steering and reporting is being developed across the value chain. Our impact measurement experiences also form a foundation for our software innovations in the fields of climate action, circular economy, social responsibility, and holistic steering and reporting, helping customers on their ESG journeys.\n\n# Impact Measurement and Valuation\n\nWe derive the definition of impact from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which states that the impact of an organization is the effect it has on the condition of the natural environment and the well-being of people. This impact can either be positive or negative and can be intended or unintended. Impact measurement and valuation is the process of first identifying and quantifying the positive and negative impacts that SAP has on people and the planet in monetary terms, and then intentionally reducing the negative impacts and increasing the positive impacts.\n\nMonetary valuation of sustainability aspects is increasingly used by corporations and investors to integrate sustainability aspects in decision-making processes. It is the language that business understands, it enables comparability, it incorporates the local context and the complexity of how impacts arise, and in the future, it could be integrated in traditional accounting systems.\n\nSeveral institutions are working on developing and maturing impact measurement and valuation methodologies, most notably the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI) and the VBA.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThese insights enable companies to create business value beyond revenue or profit growth while taking into consideration the long-term impacts of their business operations on the environment and society as a whole. The methodologies in that context continue to mature year over year, and still have several challenges to solve. Fundamentals such as global standardization, non-netting of positive and negative impacts, regulatory uptake, and ensuring a reasonable range of valuation coefficients should be integrated in the ongoing global efforts. We overcome the maturity challenge through peer learning and exchange sessions at the VBA and by taking a sensitivity analysis approach where we determine the impacts across a broad range of valuation coefficients.\n\n# Examples of Business Steering Based on VBA Methodologies\n\nWe disclosed a selection of the results of the VBA’s third methodology piloting exercise, which ended in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
