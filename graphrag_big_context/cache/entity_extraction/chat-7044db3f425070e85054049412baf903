This approach conforms to the requirements of GRI Standard indicators 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3.\n\nIn alignment with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, we report our net carbon emissions based on the two different calculation approaches: location-based and market-based.\n\n81 Link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n82 Selected data presented in the linked environmental section were part of the statutory audit or independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor. For details, see the auditor’s assurance report.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Organizational Boundaries\n\nSAP defines its organizational boundaries by applying the operational control approach as set out in the GHG Protocol. Operational control is established when SAP has the full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies. The emissions of all operations over which the company has operational control and all owned, leased facilities, co-location data centers, and vehicles that the company occupies or operates are accounted for in the carbon emissions. They are based either on measurements or, where no measured data is available, on estimations and extrapolations.\n\nA portion of SAP’s leased facilities operates under full-service or multitenant leases, where SAP does not have access to actual energy consumption information. SAP includes these facilities in our definition of operational control and accounts for them by estimating related energy consumption. To support the growing demand for SAP’s cloud offerings, we subcontract computation power in local third-party data centers. Carbon emissions are approximated and included based on the consumed or extrapolated computation power.\n\n# Data Consistency\n\n# Methodology Change\n\nWe aim to continuously refine SAP’s emissions calculation methodology and to increase the usage of measured instead of extrapolated input data. Methodology changes include changes in the source of activity data, additional new activity types, changes in emission factors, and changes in the methodology used to calculate carbon emissions. As we implemented our methodology approaches to the best of our current knowledge and ability, and consider such changes to be continuous desired progress, methodology changes will not lead to retrospective data adjustments. Hence, changes will be applied from the current year onward. The current year’s methodology changes are made transparent in this section, particularly under Methodology and Further Details.\n\n# Conversion Factors\n\nThe calculation of the carbon emissions is based on factors for conversion and extrapolation, provided by IEA, US EPA, UK DEFRA, Environment Canada, and GHG Protocol. SAP also uses extrapolation factors based on own reported data (of previous quarters) to determine an average consumption value per base unit (such as corporate cars: liters of fuel per car; facility: electricity consumption per m2). Where relevant, our conversion factors consider CO2e for greenhouse gases. Global Warming Potential factors are based on the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We report all our carbon emissions in CO2 equivalents including the impact from CH4 and N2O in our target-relevant Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. The emission impact of refrigerants includes hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) only. We review all our emissions and extrapolation factors annually and update them if required.\n\n# Methodology and Further Details\n\nBelow you will find the different parameters contributing to our carbon emissions. Data coverage refers to the share of measured data (compared to extrapolated data) that is the basis for emissions calculation, such as kWh for electricity emissions or liters of fuel for corporate car emissions.\n\n# Carbon Neutrality 2023\n\nSAP reached its target of carbon neutrality in its own operations in 2023. Carbon neutrality 2023 includes the following emission categories:\n\n283/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Scope 1\n\nRefers to direct carbon emissions and is defined as emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. At SAP, the following areas are covered by Scope 1:\n\n- Stationary Combustion in Facilities: Emissions caused by oil or gas combustion of heating systems and generators in SAP office buildings and data centers. Emission calculation is based on gas and oil consumption in kWh. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m2) based on the previous year’s stationary combustion consumption data are used for extrapolation. In cases where no specific information is available, natural gas reported by local sites is assumed to be reported as a lower heating value. Besides gas and oil, we also use wood pellets to produce thermal heat for our buildings in our headquarters in Walldorf. The Scope 1 emissions of wood pellets can be set to net ‘0’, since the wood itself absorbs an equivalent amount of carbon emissions during the growth phase as the amount of emissions released through combustion. Still, to ensure complete accounting for all emissions caused, we document the direct carbon dioxide impact of burning wood pellets as ‘outside of scopes’ carbon emissions. In 2023, these emissions accounted for 0.461 kilotons of carbon emissions (2022: 0.686 kilotons).\n- Refrigerants in Facilities: HFC emissions caused by the loss of refrigerants used in cooling systems and air conditioning equipment. The emissions are extrapolated based on the number of server units in data centers and office space with an air conditioning (A/C) system (100% data coverage). All refrigerants are assumed to be HFC134a.\n- Mobile Combustion in Corporate Cars: Emissions from fuel combustion of company cars.
