The latter includes stakeholder engagement, community building, social inclusion, and so on. These issues should be at the core of sustainable banking in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. However, an earlier study by Khan and Islam [13] suggests a similar result. Hence, it looks like there has not been much change in addressing social sustainability issues. As expected, the Bangladesh ERM did not improve this situation but only influenced the environmental performance of the banks. As Bangladeshi banks seem to have reputational motivations to integrate sustainability into their business, regulations addressing social sustainability might lead to an improvement in this regard.\n\nOverall, it looks like the Bangladeshi banking sector has been increasing its sustainability performance between 2012 and 2016. One reason for this development might be the ERM that has been introduced in 2012. Because of the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance, it not only contributes to improving the industry’s environmental and social performance, but also to its financial performance. This finding is in line with the goals of the ERM and other financial industry sustainability regulations, such as the Chinese Green Credit Policy [7–10]. However, to increase the influence of the banking industry on sustainable development, a more long-term sustainability orientation is needed [92] that is supported by investments in sustainability performance.\n\n# 7. Conclusions\n\nThe results of our study contribute to legitimacy theory by showing that legitimacy is not only a driver for CSR reporting but also for CSR-related activities. The banks in our sample have implemented some sustainability activities because external stakeholders expect this behavior. However, the activities are reactive and not firmly connected to the banks’ businesses. Green financial products and services, for instance, are not growing more than general social and environmental sustainability activities.\n\nOur practical contribution addresses strategic sustainability in banking. The results suggest that banks should not only follow sustainability regulations but that they need to develop a strategy to benefit from the sustainable business approach. With regards to regulators, our results suggest that they should also offer training and tools to enable banks to build the necessary capacity to implement sustainability into their businesses.\n\nOur research was limited with regard to data gathering. We only used publicly available data. Future research might use data from the banks that is gathered through interviews, portfolio analyses, as well as product and services analyses. Furthermore, the impacts of the sustainability performance on the environment and society should be analyzed in future research to explore the sustainability effects of financial sustainability regulations. This analysis should be done from a stakeholder perspective.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, methodology, manuscript writing—review and editing: O.W.; investigation, resources, writing—original draft preparation: R.K.C.
