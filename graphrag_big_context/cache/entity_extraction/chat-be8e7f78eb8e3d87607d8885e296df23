We only purchase derivative financial instruments to reduce risks and not for speculation, which is defined as entering into derivative instruments without a corresponding underlying transaction.\n\n# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\n# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Factors\n\nAs we are active worldwide, our ordinary operations are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies. Since the Group’s entities mainly conduct their operating business in their own functional currencies, our risk of exchange rate fluctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not considered significant. However, the Group’s entities occasionally generate foreign currency-denominated receivables, payables, and other monetary items by transacting in a currency other than the respective functional currency. To mitigate the extent of the associated foreign currency exchange rate risk, a significant portion of these transactions is hedged as described below.\n\nIn rare circumstances, transacting in a currency other than the functional currency also leads to embedded foreign currency derivatives being separated and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn addition, the intellectual property (IP) holders in the SAP Group are exposed to risks associated with forecasted intercompany cash flows in foreign currencies. These cash flows arise out of royalty payments from subsidiaries to the respective IP holder. The royalties are linked to the subsidiaries’ external revenue. This arrangement leads to a concentration of the foreign currency exchange rate risk with the IP holders, as the royalties are mostly denominated in the subsidiaries’ local currencies, while the functional currency of the IP holders with the highest royalty volume is the euro. The highest foreign currency exchange rate exposure of this kind relates to the currencies of subsidiaries with significant.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\noperations, for example the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the Australian dollar. Generally, we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk with regard to our investing and financing activities, as such activities are normally conducted in the functional currency of the investing or borrowing entity.\n\n# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management\n\nWe continuously monitor our exposure to currency fluctuation risks based on monetary items and forecasted transactions and pursue a Group-wide strategy to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, using derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, as appropriate, with the primary aim of reducing profit or loss volatility. Most of the hedging instruments are not designated as being in a hedge accounting relationship.\n\n# Currency Hedges Designated as Hedging Instruments (Cash Flow Hedges)\n\nWe enter into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge significant forecasted cash flows (royalties) from foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies with a hedge ratio of 1:1 and a hedge horizon of up to 12 months, which is also the maximum maturity of the foreign exchange derivatives we use. For all years presented, no previously highly probable transaction designated as a hedged item in a foreign currency cash flow hedge relationship ceased to be probable. Therefore, we did not discontinue any of our cash flow hedge relationships. Also, ineffectiveness was either not material or non-existent in all years reported. Generally, the cash flows of the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur and to be recognized in profit or loss monthly within a time frame of 12 months from the date of the Statement of Financial Position.\n\n# Currency Hedges Designated as Hedging Instruments (Net Investment Hedges)\n\nWe have hedged part of our net investment in our U.S. subsidiaries which have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, by entering into a deal contingent forward. The hedged risk is the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The deal contingent forward is designated as a hedging instrument for the changes in the value of the net investment that is attributable to changes in the U.S. dollar/euro spot rate. To assess hedge effectiveness, we have determined the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, by comparing changes in the carrying amount of the deal contingent forward that is attributable to a change in the spot rate with changes in the investment in the U.S. subsidiaries due to movements in the spot rate.\n\n# The amounts as at December 31, 2023, relating to items designated as hedged items were as follows:\n\n| |Forecasted License Payments|Net Investment|Forecasted License Payments|Net Investment|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2023|2022|\n|Change in value used for calculating hedge ineffectiveness|19|–15|32|0|\n|Cash flow hedge|19|0|32|0|\n|Cost of hedging|–7|0|–9|0|\n|Balances remaining in cash flow hedge reserve for which hedge accounting is no longer applied|0|–15|0|0|\n\n# The amounts as at December 31, 2023, designated as hedging instruments were as follows:\n\n219/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Designated Hedging Instruments in Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Hedges\n\n| |Forecasted License Payments in EUR|Forecasted License Payments in EUR|Net Investment in USD|Net Investment in USD|\n|---|---|---|\n|€ millions|2023|2022|2023|2022|\n|Nominal amount|2,390|1,371|0|0|\n|Carrying amount| | | | |\n|Other financial assets|33|–9|0|0|\n|Other financial liabilities|–20|–9|0|0|\n|Change in value recognized in OCI|19|32\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
