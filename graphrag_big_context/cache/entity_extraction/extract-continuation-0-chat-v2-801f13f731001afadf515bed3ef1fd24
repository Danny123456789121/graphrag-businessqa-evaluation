Second, identifying and avoiding bias is a key principle of our Global AI Ethics program. Consequently, we review AI use cases to ensure that bias and discrimination and other ethical risks specified in the Global AI Ethics Policy are mitigated. High-risk AI use cases are approved or rejected by the Global AI Ethics Steering Committee as applicable.\n\n# Assessing Human Rights Measures\n\nSAP reviews the effectiveness of its risk management and due diligence processes annually as well as on an ad hoc basis. In 2023, we revised our approach to assess effectiveness so as to better align with the UN Guiding Principles and legal requirements. For example, we piloted IOOI (input – output – outcome – impact) models to get a better understanding of whether our measures have a positive impact on people. This new approach complements existing measures such as the internal audits we\n\n123/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nhave conducted since 2012 to help us verify that subsidiaries adhere to human rights standards and check whether employees feel empowered to raise concerns.\n\n# Receiving Complaints or Concerns\n\nThrough the globally available Speak Out at SAP tool, we encourage all employees and external groups to report conduct that violates our policies. External groups include groups at heightened risk of becoming disadvantaged or marginalized (also called “vulnerable groups”) such as temporary staff. Employees can also reach out to their managers, to HR or compliance officers, and to our Global Ombuds Office which offers confidential, independent, neutral, and informal conflict clarification services and mediation for all employees worldwide.\n\n# Related Risks for SAP\n\n“Human rights and employee matters” is a risk factor that is assessed as part of SAP’s corporate risk management system. No financial material risks were identified through our risk framework, which is detailed in the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Human Rights section was not subject to the statutory audit of the combined management report. However, our external auditor performed an independent limited assurance engagement for the content of this section.\n\n124/324\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Risk Management and Risks\n\n# Our Risk Management\n\n# Internal Control and Risk Management Systems\n\nAs a global company, SAP is exposed to a broad range of risks across our business operations. Consequently, our Executive Board has established comprehensive internal control and risk management structures that enable us to identify and analyze risks early and take appropriate action. Our internal control and risk management systems are designed to identify potential events that could negatively impact the Company and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting.\n\nThese systems comprise numerous control mechanisms and are an essential element of our corporate decision-making process; they are therefore implemented across the entire Group as an integral part of SAP’s business processes. We have adopted an integrated internal control and risk management approach to help maintain appropriate and effective global risk management while also enabling us to aggregate risks and report on them transparently.\n\n# Appropriateness and Effectiveness of SAP’s Entire Internal Control and Risk Management System\n\nWe have a governance model in place across the internal control and risk management systems, as well as a central software solution to store, maintain, and report all risk-relevant information. In the Business Conduct section of our combined management report, we describe in more detail the governance structure as well as the measures and guidelines SAP has implemented to ensure compliance not only with international rules and legal requirements but also with our internal standards of ethics and integrity. Furthermore, SAP monitors risks relating to material sustainability matters. Material non-financial topics are listed in the section Non-Financial Statement Including Information on Sustainable Activities. The governance model, policies, and guidelines as well as the control measures we have implemented relative to these topics are described in the respective chapters in this combined management report. SAP continuously reviews and adjusts its entire internal control and risk management system as well as the policies and guidelines we have implemented regarding the material sustainability topics. We considered the results from external audits, such as the audit of our internal control system for financial reporting and early risk detection system conducted by our auditor BDO, as well as internal sources, such as audit reports from our Global Risk & Assurance Services (GR&AS) team, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control and risk management systems. If issues are identified, SAP takes remedial action. While the non-financial internal control system has not yet reached the same maturity level as the financial internal control system, no material indication has come to our attention that SAP’s entire internal control and risk management system is not appropriate or effective.\n\n# Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nDue to our public listings in both Germany and the United States, we are subject to both German and U.S. regulatory requirements that relate to internal controls and risk management over financial reporting, such as provisions in the German Stock Corporation Act, section 91 (2), the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, specifically sections 302 and 404, and the German Corporate Governance Code. Hence, our Executive Board has established an early warning system (risk management system) to enable transparent risk disclosures and compliance with applicable regulations.\n\n68 The appropriateness and effectiveness of SAP’s entire internal control and risk management system, except for the internal control system for financial reporting and early risk detection system, was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Risk Management Policy and Framework\n\nThe risk\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a global company that focuses on software solutions and services, with a commitment to ethical practices and human rights standards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL AI ETHICS STEERING COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global AI Ethics Steering Committee at SAP is responsible for reviewing high-risk AI use cases to mitigate bias and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES<|>EVENT<|>The UN Guiding Principles provide a framework for businesses to respect human rights and ensure ethical practices in their operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL OMBUDS OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global Ombuds Office at SAP offers confidential and neutral conflict resolution services for employees worldwide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BDO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BDO is an external auditor that conducts audits for SAP, including assessments of internal control systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is one of the countries where SAP is publicly listed and subject to its regulatory requirements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is another country where SAP is publicly listed and must comply with its regulatory requirements.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GLOBAL AI ETHICS STEERING COMMITTEE<|>The Global AI Ethics Steering Committee is part of SAP's efforts to manage ethical risks in AI use cases<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GLOBAL OMBUDS OFFICE<|>The Global Ombuds Office provides conflict resolution services for SAP employees, supporting the company's commitment to ethical practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>BDO<|>BDO conducts independent audits for SAP, ensuring compliance with internal control and risk management systems<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMANY<|>SAP is subject to regulatory requirements in Germany due to its public listing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>UNITED STATES<|>SAP is subject to regulatory requirements in the United States due to its public listing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL AI ETHICS STEERING COMMITTEE<|>UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES<|>The committee's work aligns with the UN Guiding Principles on business and human rights<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
