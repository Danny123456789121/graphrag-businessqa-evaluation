All respondents have decision-making authority over climate or AI topics at their organizations. Respondents were permitted to give more than one answer.\n\n7 ACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION WITH AI\n\n# Emissions Reduction Potential\n\nRegarding emissions reduction potential, a 2021 BCG study (see Reduce Carbon and Costs with the Power of AI) estimates that currently proven AI-enabled use cases could reduce emissions by 5% to 10% by 2030. If that potential is fully realized, AI-driven applications would be responsible for achieving roughly between 10% and 20% of the IPCC’s 2030 interim emissions-reduction target for the world to achieve net zero by 2050.5 Similarly, a Microsoft/PwC study looking at four sectors (agriculture, energy, transport, and water) estimates that AI has the potential to reduce global GHG emissions by 4%.6 Further, respondents in a Capgemini survey of companies that had leveraged AI for climate action reported that their efforts to date had achieved GHG reductions of between 11.3% and 14.3% depending on the sector—and these executives believe that AI could reduce overall GHG emissions by 15.9% in the next three to five years.7\n\n# Adaptation and Resilience\n\nOn adaptation and resilience, AI can help cities forecast their climate vulnerability, develop estimates of the cost of inaction, and model the impact of different climate interventions. These insights can aid them in identifying the actions with the greatest benefit, generating private-sector enthusiasm for funding investable projects, and securing public and philanthropic support for essential, but non-bankable, adaptations. It also can help guide real-time decision-making in agriculture—for example, increasing crop production through intelligent irrigation systems—or in fast-moving crises such as wildfires.\n\n# Foundational Capabilities\n\nAnd AI offers many foundational capabilities that support both short-term and long-term climate action. For example, it can support today’s climate research with higher-fidelity climate change simulations. But it also has the potential to accelerate breakthrough innovations in domains such as physics, chemistry, biology, and material science that could “bend the curve” on climate progress.\n\nAll of our estimates are based on the current state of AI technology—and thus speak primarily to AI’s potential in currently proven applications. Today, we are in the early stages of the adoption curve. Transforming potential to achievement will require that all organizations fully embrace AI as an essential enabler of their climate actions. And it is important to note that our assessment does not encompass major AI-driven disruptions and breakthroughs—for example, new materials for batteries, new drought-resistant crops, novel carbon removal technologies, and scalable approaches to nuclear fusion—that could unlock massive positive impact.\n\n# The Promise of AI\n\nThe promise of AI is real. While we are already seeing benefits, we need to accelerate its contribution to planet-saving climate impact. The next chapter offers a deeper dive into the primary known climate-related use cases for AI—and highlights some examples of how and where AI is already making a positive difference.\n\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP GOOGLE\n\n# How AI Can Help Accelerate Climate Action\n\nIt has demonstrated the potential to enable and catalyze climate progress in three broad areas: taking emissions mitigation to the next level, shaping strategies for adaptation and resilience, and supporting both climate research and reinforcing technologies. Some AI applications are in early stages, some are being tested, and others are already being scaled. But all will need to be embraced more broadly if we are to fulfill the promise of AI to limit warming to less than 1.5°C.\n\nExhibit 3 summarizes the most promising of the currently known AI use cases for climate. The rest of this chapter will offer more detail on each, along the way highlighting inspiring examples of how AI is helping unlock and accelerate climate progress.\n\n# AI’s Role in Emissions Mitigation\n\nGetting smarter on reducing and removing emissions is essential. And AI is already delivering significant wins that need to be scaled. Its contributions fall into two broad areas: measurement and monitoring, and reduction and removal.\n\n# Measurement and Monitoring\n\nWithout reliable, clean, and independently verifiable data, effective climate action is difficult. Countries and companies need to know their baselines and track their progress, both at the macro level (“What are our total GHG emissions?”) and the micro level (“Which aspects of our operations and broader supply chain are the big drivers? Are our efforts at reduction or removal delivering the expected results?”).\n\n# Exhibit 3 - Key AI applications to accelerate climate progress\n\n|Mitigation|Adaptation and Resilience|\n|---|---|\n|Measurement & Monitoring|Hazard Prediction|\n|Macro-level measurement|Building early warning systems|\n|e.g., calculating carbon footprint at the country level|e.g., predicting near-term extreme events such as flooding, drought, and cyclones|\n|Micro-level measurement|Vulnerability Management|\n|e.g., calculating carbon footprints of individual products|e.g., monitoring drought and wildfire spread|\n|Supporting nature-based & technological removal|Building resilient infrastructure & protecting biodiversity|\n|e.g., assessing natural carbon stocks|e.g., intelligent irrigation, monitoring of endangered species|\n\n# Foundational Capabilities\n\n- Climate modeling e.g., monitoring drought and wildfire spread\n- Climate economics e.g., developing cost of inaction assessments\n- Education & behavioral change e.g., developing recommendations for climate-friendly consumption\n- Innovation & breakthroughs e.g., supporting research on fusion\n\nEffective measurement and monitoring solutions leverage AI to process and analyze data from multiple sources such as satellite data, weather data, sensors, and other heavy data\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
