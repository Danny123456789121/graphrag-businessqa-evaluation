We initially identify future growth and profitability drivers at a highly aggregated level for the entire SAP Group. In a first step, the financial plan’s growth ambition is determined by its comprehensive product portfolio which is grouped into solution areas, with profitability drivers allocated to functions such as development, marketing, sales, delivery, and administration. In a second step, the planned total revenues and total expenses are generally allocated to the operating segments and the areas of functional responsibility of the individual members of the Executive Board (“Board area”). If a Board area represents not only a functional department but also has responsibility for operating segments within this Board area, the allocation is done at the lower segment level.\n\nBudget adjustments may be applied during the year to reflect changes in priorities, to achieve efficiency targets, and to reflect endogenous and exogenous factors. Such budget adjustments, and the assessment of performance, are handled at Board area level if the Board area is part of a segment, or at segment level if the Board area comprises several segments. It is then the individual Executive Board member’s responsibility to break down the allocated budget adjustments within the segment budget boundary.\n\nBased on an integrated portfolio process running in parallel to the budgeting process, we ensure aligned investment behavior across Board areas with regard to specific solution and/or subsolution areas. In a final step, customer-facing revenue targets and cost-of-sales and marketing targets are broken down into sales regions and market units.\n\nBased on our detailed annual plans, we determine the budget for the respective fiscal year. We also have processes in place to forecast revenue and profit on a quarterly basis, to quantify whether we expect to realize our financial targets, and to identify any deviations from plan. We continuously monitor the affected operating segments and Board areas in the SAP Group to analyze their developments and define any appropriate actions. Our entire network of planning, control, and reporting processes is implemented in integrated planning and information systems, based on SAP software, across all organizational units so that we can conduct the evaluations and analyses needed to make informed decisions.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Non-IFRS Financial Measures Cited in This Report\n\n# Explanation of Non-IFRS Measures\n\nWe disclose certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS and are therefore considered non-IFRS financial measures. Our non-IFRS financial measures may not correspond to non-IFRS financial measures that other companies report. The non-IFRS financial measures that we report should only be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, nor as superior to, our IFRS financial measures.\n\nWe believe that the disclosed supplemental historical and prospective non-IFRS financial information provides useful information to investors, because management uses this information, in addition to financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS, to attain a more transparent understanding of our past performance and our anticipated future results.\n\nWe use these non-IFRS measures consistently in our internal planning and forecasting, reporting, and compensation, as follows:\n\n- Our management primarily uses these non-IFRS measures rather than IFRS measures as the basis for making financial, strategic, and operating decisions.\n- The variable components of our Executive Board members’ and employees’ remuneration are based on non-IFRS numbers such as operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) rather than the respective IFRS measures. An additional variable component used is CCB. In September 2023, the SAP Supervisory Board decided that although expenses and corresponding releases for provisions for regulatory compliance matters are eliminated from operating profit (non-IFRS), they will affect the compensation paid to Executive Board members from fiscal year 2025 onward. This amendment does not apply to 2023 or 2024, to ensure that the Executive Board members’ current compensation is not affected by conduct that took place in performance periods prior to their appointment to the Executive Board.\n- The annual budgeting process for all management units is based on operating profit (non-IFRS) numbers rather than the respective IFRS financial measure.\n- All forecast and performance reviews with all senior managers globally are based on these non-IFRS measures, rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.\n- Both our internal performance targets and the guidance we provide to the capital markets are based on profit (non-IFRS) measures rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.\n\nOur non-IFRS financial measures reflect adjustments based on the items below, as well as adjustments for the related income tax effects.\n\n# Operating Expense (Non-IFRS)\n\nNumbers that are identified as operating expenses (non-IFRS) have been adjusted by excluding the following expenses:\n\n- Acquisition-related charges\n- Amortization expense/impairment charges for intangibles acquired in business combinations, including goodwill, and certain stand-alone acquisitions of intellectual property (including purchased in-process research and development) as well as sale/disposal gains and losses for these intangibles\n- Settlements of preexisting business relationships in connection with a business combination\n- Acquisition-related third-party expenses\n- Share-based payment expenses (applicable only until 2023)\n- Restructuring expenses in accordance with IFRS\n- Expenses for regulatory compliance matters associated with the provision for (potential) penalties arising from certain ongoing governmental investigations into our business operations, which are\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\ndescribed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2023, Note (G.3), and are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
