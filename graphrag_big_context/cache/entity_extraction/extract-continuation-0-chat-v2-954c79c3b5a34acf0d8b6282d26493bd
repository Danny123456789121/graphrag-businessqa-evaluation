If this data is not available, regional quotas or other available country quotas are used for approximation. We also collect reusage data from ISO 14001-certified SAP locations that are not (fully) covered by our large IT asset lifecycle partners. This amount is included in the reusage data visualized in the Waste and Water section.\n\nIn 2023, an analytical reporting sourcing system was developed and implemented to improve assessment and management, gain clear insights in sustainability performance in data centers (for example, waste diverted from disposal versus waste directed to disposal). We roll out monthly Sustainability & Commercial reports with complete insights in all process steps from handover to final processing for our data centers’ e-waste. This report includes information about raw and extracted hazardous materials.\n\n# Calculation of E-Waste Without Treatment Insights\n\nTo supplement our e-waste data from our large IT asset lifecycle partners, we also collect data from all locations that are a) in scope of our ISO 14001-certified environmental management system (EMS), and b) not (fully) covered by our large partners.\n\nFor SAP sites that are neither covered by our partners nor are part of SAP’s EMS, we extrapolate e-waste shares for end-user IT equipment based on full-time equivalents. The end-of-life treatment split into recycling and incineration with energy recovery and landfill is calculated based on the country-specific or region-specific factors of the Global E-waste Monitor 2020.\n\nFor co-location data centers not covered by our global IT asset lifecycle partners, we extrapolate the data based on the electricity consumption share. The e-waste treatment split into recycling and incineration with energy recovery and landfill is calculated based on the country-specific or region-specific factors of the Global E-waste Monitor 2020.\n\nOverall, we achieved a data coverage for our WEEE reporting of 94%.\n\n# Audit Scope\n\nThe content of the Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance section was subject to an independent limited assurance engagement by our external auditor. Under this engagement, the quantitative indicators carbon emissions (scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions relevant for SAP’s business model), total energy consumption and renewable energy certificates were audited at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Our Contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally accepted framework anchored in human rights, which we use for communicating our purpose to “help the world run better and improve people’s lives.” We strive to execute on this purpose by being a role model for sustainable, purpose-led operations and by enabling our customers to operate in a sustainable way. Following the adoption of the SDGs by world leaders in September 2015, we identified and aligned existing initiatives with all 17 SDGs. For example, we looked at the environmental and social impacts of customers using SAP technology and applications, linking these impacts to the SDGs. The resulting Web book “SAP and the UN Global Goals“ was published in early 2016 and has been updated regularly.\n\nIn discussions with our ESG Steering Board and external sustainability advisory panel, we defined the SDGs for which there is a tangible and material link between our own operational activities or the use of our software by customers.\n\nThe following table describes the potential positive (+) and negative (–) direct or indirect impacts of our company and of our products and services related to the selected SDGs. We use “direct” when we refer to impacts through our own operations; “indirect” describes impacts through the use of our solutions and technology or in our ecosystem.\n\n# SDG 3 Good Health and Well-Being\n\n|Our Potential Direct and Indirect Impact|Direct:|Provide access to a healthy lifestyle and a safe and healthy working environment for our employees|\n|---|---|---|\n| |Indirect:|Enhance safe and healthy working conditions, healthcare, and personalized medicine on a global scale Increase transparency of physical, medical, and health conditions of individuals, which might be abused|\n\n# Our KPIs and Targets\n\nBusiness Health Culture Index\n\n# Our Policies and Selected Activities and Programs to Enhance Positive Impacts and Mitigate Negative Impacts\n\n|Direct:|Global Health and Safety Policy;
