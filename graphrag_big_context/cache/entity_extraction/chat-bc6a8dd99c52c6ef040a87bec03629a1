We therefore manage interest rate risks by adding interest-rate-related derivative instruments to a given portfolio of investments and debt financing. The desired fixed-floating mix of our net debt is set by the Treasury Committee.\n\n# Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments (Fair Value Hedges)\n\nTo match the interest rate risk from our financing transactions to our investments, we use receiver interest rate swaps to alter the interest cash flows of certain fixed-rate financial liabilities to floating, and by this means secure the fair value of the swapped financing transactions on a 1:1 ratio. Including interest rate swaps, 43% (2022: 52%) of our total interest-bearing financial liabilities outstanding as at December 31, 2023, had a fixed interest rate.\n\n# Designated Hedged Items in Interest Rate Hedges\n\n| |2023|2023|2022|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n| |Fixed-Rate Borrowing in EUR|Fixed-Rate Borrowing in USD|Fixed-Rate Borrowing in EUR|Fixed-Rate Borrowing in USD|\n|Notional amount (€ millions)|4,550|90|4,550|94|\n|Carrying amount (€ millions)|3,964|89|3,732|95|\n|Accumulated fair value adjustments in Other financial liabilities|556|–6|782|–9|\n|Change in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness for the reporting period|226|1|–723|–11|\n|Accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments for hedged items ceased to be adjusted for hedging gains/losses|0|–7|0|–11|\n\n# The amounts as at December 31, 2023, designated as hedging instruments were as follows:\n\n| |2023|2023|2022|2022|\n|---|---|---|\n| |Interest Rate Swaps for EUR Borrowing|Interest Rate Swaps for USD Borrowing|Interest Rate Swaps for EUR Borrowing|Interest Rate Swaps for USD Borrowing|\n|Notional amount (€ millions)|4,550|90|4,550|94|\n|Carrying amount| | | | |\n|Other financial assets|0|0|0|0|\n|Other financial liabilities|–535|–1|–749|–3|\n|Change in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness for the reporting period|–214|–2|700|10|\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates:\n\n# Details on Hedging Instruments in Interest Rate Hedges\n\n|€ millions|2024|2027|2028|2029|2030|2031|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|EUR interest rate swaps|Nominal amounts|1,000|1,000|800|500|1,250|\n| |Average variable interest rate|5.941%|5.365%|4.705%|5.340%|5.503%|\n|USD interest rate swaps|Nominal amounts|90| | | | |\n| |Average variable interest rate|6.150%| | | | |\n\n# 2022\n\n|€ millions|2024|2027|2028|2029|2030|2031|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|EUR interest rate swaps|Nominal amounts|1,000|1,000|800|500|1,250|\n| |Average variable interest rate|3.949%|3.373%|2.713%|3.348%|3.511%|\n|USD interest rate swaps|Nominal amounts|94| | | | |\n| |Average variable interest rate|5.150%| | | | |\n\n# Interest Rate Exposure\n\nOur interest rate exposure (and our average/high\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
