At SAP’s headquarters, we are in the process of implementing an on-site Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) solar project with the aim of increasing the share of renewable electricity self-produced on-site and achieving price stability.\n- As a potential third lever, we are running a green tariff pilot in Australia to power our local facilities with renewable electricity (bundled EACs).\n\nThis approach allows us to reduce our entire electricity-consumption-related emissions (2023: 256 kt in total; 161 kt by SAP and 95 kt by suppliers; 2022: 257 kt). Going forward, we aim to expand the usage of Power Purchase Agreements for sourcing renewable electricity.\n\n# ISO 14001\n\n- SAP’s environmental management system (EMS) is implemented in over 45 sites in 26 countries worldwide and certified by the internationally recognized ISO 14001:2015 standard. In 2023, we successfully maintained this certification.\n- Target: Increase EMS scope to 100% of SAP’s major company-owned sites by 2025 (2023: 86%).\n\n# ISO 50001\n\n- SAP’s headquarters in Germany and North America and 100% of SAP’s own major data centers (St. Leon-Rot and Walldorf in Germany, and Colorado Springs and Newtown Square in the United States) operate an ISO 50001:2018-certified energy management system.\n\nFor more insight into our sustainability software portfolio, see SAP’s Website (link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by our external auditor).\n\nWe achieve this by leveraging 1) investments in high-quality, EKOenergy-certified EACs, and 2) renewables produced on-site. The term “data center” refers to both SAP-owned and external data centers (co-location data centers and hyperscalers).\n\nRelating to the electricity consumed by cloud solutions from SAP only.\n\nThe term “data center” refers to both SAP-owned and external data centers (co-location data centers and hyperscalers).\n\nFor more information, see section Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\n# Global car fleet: Transition to electric or zero-emission vehicles\n\n- Efficient power usage effectiveness (PUE)58 at SAP headquarters in Germany and North America: 1.50\n- Core refurbishment of buildings: starting with building WDF01 at SAP’s headquarters in Germany, which aims to save 42% in final energy used annually compared to the previous construction method.\n- Centralization of the cooling distribution system at SAP’s headquarters in Germany will allow the usage of environmentally friendly operating fluids and sector coupling (conversion of surplus energy into cooling energy by absorption chillers and use of heat pumps for room cooling). Electricity for the cooling system will be derived primarily from renewable sources (such as solar).\n\nFrom 2025 onwards, all new company cars for employees are planned to be emission-free.59 At the end of 2023, about 14% of our global car fleet comprised emission-free vehicles. SAP also promotes various incentives to accelerate this change, for example:\n\n- We power all SAP-owned charging stations at SAP locations with 100% renewable electricity.\n- For larger vehicle fleets such as in Germany, the Netherlands, and others, we offer employees a subsidy to install a charging point at home, and reimburse them for the electricity consumed. As far as legally possible and factually reasonable, we will offer similar subsidies in all countries.\n- In some countries, we offer our employees a discount or a higher budget if they choose an all-electric vehicle.\n- We continually expand SAP’s global charging infrastructure (2023: 1,650+ charging stations; 2022: 1,100+ charging stations).\n\n# Alternative commuting\n\nTo generate a shift in commuting habits and foster inter-/multimodal mobility, we continue to offer various programs, such as:\n\n- Company bicycle leasing programs: Employees can lease bicycles with the option of purchasing them after contract end. Such programs have already been established in Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg.\n- Successful roll out of a flexible mobility budget in spring 2023 as a regular mobility alternative in Germany (2023: about 1,950 participants). Participants receive a fixed monthly mobility budget to use any mode of transport to commute to work or in their leisure time (bicycle, e-scooter, rental car, train, bus, and so on).\n\n# Business flights\n\n- We avoid business flights by investing in virtual collaboration and communication technologies.\n- In 2016, we began charging an internal carbon price for business flights, which we invest in high-quality carbon offset projects to counterbalance the carbon emissions these flights cause. By annually increasing the carbon price per flight ticket that is charged to the organizational cost center, we seek to incentivize the organizational units and employees to fly less or to choose an alternative, sustainable mode of travel.\n\n# Investing in Carbon Offsets to Compensate for Our Remaining Emissions\n\nSAP financed a diverse portfolio of carbon projects60 with a strategic focus on natural carbon sinks to help avoid and remove from the atmosphere the equivalent of the remaining emissions from its own operations (2023: 215 kt, 2022: 97 kt; scope 1, 2, and selected scope 3 emissions).61 All offsets were generated by reforestation, forest protection, rural energy, and agroforestry projects implemented in collaboration with local communities. This voluntary investment in certified carbon offsets helped SAP reach its carbon-neutrality goal in 2023.\n\n58 The PUE is a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP is a multinational software corporation that focuses on enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations, and is committed to sustainability initiatives including renewable energy and carbon neutrality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALO ALTO<|>GEO<|>Palo Alto is a city in California, USA, where SAP has implemented solar panels as part of its sustainability efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANGALORE<|>GEO<|>Bangalore is a city in India where SAP has installed solar panels to enhance its renewable energy usage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUGINS<|>GEO<|>Mougins is a city in France where SAP has also implemented solar panels as part of its global sustainability strategy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is the location where SAP is running a green tariff pilot to power local facilities with renewable electricity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 14001<|>EVENT<|>ISO 14001 is an international standard for environmental management systems that SAP has implemented in over 45 sites worldwide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 50001<|>EVENT<|>ISO 50001 is an international standard for energy management systems that SAP's major data centers operate under.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is the country where SAP's headquarters is located and where significant sustainability initiatives are being implemented.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>GEO<|>North America is a region where SAP operates and has implemented ISO 50001-certified energy management systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO SPRINGS<|>GEO<|>Colorado Springs is a city in the United States where SAP has a major data center operating under ISO 50001 certification.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW TOWN SQUARE<|>GEO<|>New Town Square is another city in the United States where SAP has a major data center operating under ISO 50001 certification.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EKOENERGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EKOenergy is a label for renewable energy that SAP invests in to enhance its sustainability efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON OFFSET PROJECTS<|>EVENT<|>SAP invests in carbon offset projects to counterbalance its carbon emissions, focusing on natural carbon sinks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC VEHICLES<|>EVENT<|>SAP is transitioning its global car fleet to electric or zero-emission vehicles as part of its sustainability initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARGING STATIONS<|>EVENT<|>SAP has established a network of charging stations powered by renewable electricity for its electric vehicle fleet.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLEXIBLE MOBILITY BUDGET<|>EVENT<|>SAP has introduced a flexible mobility budget in Germany to encourage sustainable commuting options for employees.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>PALO ALTO<|>SAP has implemented solar panels in Palo Alto as part of its sustainability initiatives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>BANGALORE<|>SAP has installed solar panels in Bangalore to enhance its renewable energy usage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>MOUGINS<|>SAP has implemented solar panels in Mougins as part of its global sustainability strategy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>AUSTRALIA<|>SAP is running a green tariff pilot in Australia to power local facilities with renewable electricity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>ISO 14001<|>SAP's environmental management system is certified by ISO 14001, implemented in over 45 sites<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>ISO 50001<|>SAP's major data centers operate under ISO 50001 certification for energy management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>GERMANY<|>SAP's headquarters is located in Germany, where significant sustainability initiatives are being implemented<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>SAP has implemented ISO 50001-certified energy management systems in North America<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>COLORADO SPRINGS<|>SAP has a major data center in Colorado Springs operating under ISO 50001 certification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>NEW TOWN SQUARE<|>SAP has a major data center in New Town Square operating under ISO 50001 certification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>EKOENERGY<|>SAP invests in EKOenergy-certified renewable energy to enhance its sustainability efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>CARBON OFFSET PROJECTS<|>SAP invests in carbon offset projects to counterbalance its carbon emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>ELECTRIC VEHICLES<|>SAP is transitioning its global car fleet to electric or zero-emission vehicles<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>CHARGING STATIONS<|>SAP powers its charging stations with 100% renewable electricity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP<|>FLEXIBLE MOBILITY BUDGET<|>SAP has introduced a flexible mobility budget in Germany to encourage sustainable commuting<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
