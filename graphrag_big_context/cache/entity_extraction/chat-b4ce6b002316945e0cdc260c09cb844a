LeanIX is a market leader in enterprise architecture management (EAM) software that drives the modernization of IT landscapes and continuous business transformation.

The sale closed on June 28, 2023. SAP remains a close go-to-market and technology partner with Qualtrics. For more information about Qualtrics, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (D.1).\n\n# Sapphire Ventures\n\nIn addition to our investments in organic growth and acquisitions, SAP also supports entrepreneurs that aspire to build industry-leading businesses through venture capital funds managed by Sapphire Ventures. Sapphire Ventures manages more than US$10 billion (over €9 billion) and has invested in more than 200 companies. It pursues opportunities in which it can help fuel enterprise growth by adding expertise, relationships, geographic reach, and capital. It places a particular focus on companies in Europe, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Sapphire Ventures has committed to investing more than US$1 billion in the next generation of AI-powered enterprise technology startups.\n\n# Our Product Strategy\n\nSAP’s product portfolio allows enterprises to manage their resources, spend, employees, and customer relationships. SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is the platform for SAP, our customers, and our ecosystem to build, integrate, and extend solutions, and to manage enterprise data. It also serves as a central place for SAP Business AI technology.\n\nSAP Business AI refers to artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities available across SAP’s suite of enterprise applications and SAP BTP. SAP offers a range of AI-powered use cases built into core business processes across finance, supply chain, procurement, sales, marketing, human resources, and IT. By using these AI capabilities, customers can benefit from automation, recommendations, forecasting, and natural human-machine interaction. In addition, SAP BTP provides business-specific AI services that empower our partners and customers to implement AI into their SAP applications and extensions while reducing data science effort, integration, and operational complexity.\n\nIn September 2023, we launched Joule, a copilot built directly into our solutions. In November 2023, we introduced the new AI Foundation on SAP BTP group of technologies, new vector capabilities on SAP HANA to leverage AI, and SAP Build Code, an AI-powered solution set to make professional coders more productive. In December 2023, we introduced Cloud ERP Suite as a clustering of our strategic cloud solutions.\n\nThe following offerings are currently part of our Cloud ERP Suite: SAP S/4HANA Cloud as part of Cloud ERP, SAP BTP, core solutions for HR and payroll, spend management, commerce, customer data solutions, business process transformation, and working capital management. With SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP as key elements and foundation of those offerings, we strive for an expansion of our commercial models, with increased focus on packaged suite deals and flexible consumption models, such as RISE Premium Plus. Further, we aim to drive the adoption of multi-cloud solutions across the mentioned offerings.\n\n# SAP Integrated Report 2023\n\n# To Our Stakeholders\n\n# Combined Management Report\n\n# Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS\n\n# Further Information about Sustainability\n\n# Additional Information\n\nFurther, SAP strives to help customers grow their businesses profitably, while at the same time minimizing the risks. To this end, SAP has two offerings, RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP, which cater to different customer objectives and requirements.\n\n# RISE with SAP\n\nRISE with SAP is a business transformation solution aimed at helping customers migrate their ERP system to the cloud and accelerate their digital transformation. It is a tailored offering that targets SAP’s existing customer base running on other SAP solutions, or net-new customers with large or complex business requirements. RISE with SAP aims to provide enhanced productivity by means of automated processes, with the option of running technology operations as a service with SAP or in the customer’s own data center.\n\n# GROW with SAP\n\nGROW with SAP is a commercial offering designed specifically to help grow midmarket companies that do not yet use an ERP system from SAP and aspire to go live within a short period of time without extensive customization. With GROW with SAP, customers can use predefined best-practice processes that are available for different industries, and can benefit from predictable costs, the continuous provision of technical innovations, and scalability. It is designed so that companies can grow according to their needs, without significantly increasing the complexity for business processes and management.\n\nAs the IT landscape continues to rapidly evolve, SAP is seeing a clear shift in customer preferences together with a growing demand for flexibility, agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Understanding the importance of helping customers embrace digital technologies to thrive in today’s dynamic business environment, SAP has committed to a forward-thinking cloud strategy. SAP acknowledges that every organization’s experience with the cloud can be unique and can therefore be challenging, yet many customers who have made the shift to a cloud strategy can use the benefits that today’s business environments require, such as the ability to redistribute resources previously required for managing internal IT teams, and remote global accessibility from any location through an Internet connection regardless of where teams are located around the world.
