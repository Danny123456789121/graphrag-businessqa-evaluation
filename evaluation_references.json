            "ground_truth": "The integration of General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in both recruitment and supplier management offers transformative potential, yet simultaneously poses significant risks, as its ability to merge diverse datasets can lead to biased decision-making processes. In recruitment, GAI's advanced analytical capabilities may inadvertently perpetuate discrimination and inequality if the models used are biased, impacting the fairness of hiring practices. Similarly, while GAI can enhance supplier portfolio assessments by evaluating factors such as product quality, reliability, efficiency, insolvency risks, and sustainability, the reliance on potentially skewed data could skew these evaluations, leading to unjust outcomes. Thus, while GAI holds the promise of more informed decision-making, its implementation must be carefully managed to prevent the reinforcement of existing biases and ensure equitable and accurate outcomes across all applications.",
