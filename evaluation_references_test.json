            "question": "How can a company strategically integrate a Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) with a Green Shared Vision and a comprehensive evaluation framework to simultaneously enhance environmental conservation, improve financial performance, and foster stronger stakeholder relationships, while addressing specific challenges such as green confusion, social sustainability, and the impact of external factors like climate vulnerability and pandemics?",
            "ground_truth": "Endiana et al. assert that the accounting sector of a company can foster environmental conservation and enhance performance through the implementation of a Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS), by appropriately allocating environmental costs, thereby improving financial outcomes and customer loyalty. From the employees' perspective, Chang et al. emphasize the importance of establishing a solid Green Shared Vision to mitigate green confusion and boost economic performance, highlighting the role of green product psychological ownership in influencing behavior and performance. Complementing these views, Ikram et al. propose the inclusion of more categories to assess specific aspects of firms, such as social sustainability, suggesting nine categories: Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economic, Environmental, Social, Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, Energy Consumption, and Pandemic COVID-19 impact, to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework. Together, these perspectives underscore the multifaceted approach necessary for companies to achieve sustainability, improve financial performance, and enhance stakeholder relationships.",

            "question": "How can multinational corporations effectively integrate sustainable human resource management practices with innovative environmental strategies and diverse team dynamics to enhance their overall corporate sustainability performance, while simultaneously addressing socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficiency dimensions across different global markets?",
            "ground_truth": "Mazur and Walczynia, in alignment with Chang et al., emphasize the importance of implementing sustainable management of human resources (SMHR) when a company has a robust corporate sustainability perspective, ensuring that current needs are met without jeopardizing future stakeholders' needs. Complementing this, Xia et al. identify practices that enhance corporate sustainability performance across socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficiency dimensions by fostering environmental innovation, redesigning consumer offers, supporting institutional and policy measures, and promoting synergetic stakeholder involvement. Additionally, Hahn et al. argue that a diverse team setting, encompassing varied perspectives on problem-solving and sustainability, is crucial. They assert that teams overly dominated by business-case or paradoxical mindsets may struggle to achieve significant corporate sustainability performance, whereas a balanced team is more likely to succeed in these endeavors. Together, these insights underscore the multifaceted approach required to achieve effective corporate sustainability.",

            "ground_truth": "In the context of growing global concern for companies to align their corporate sustainability goals with international standards, it is proposed by Zhang et al. that firms utilize indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability disclosure. However, they highlight persistent challenges due to varying interpretations of corporate sustainability across different countries. Complementing this view, Weber and Chowdury emphasize the importance of evaluating corporate sustainability by categorizing indicators into four distinct groups: social sustainability, environmental sustainability, green products, and services. Meanwhile, Baumgartner and Rauter argue that achieving corporate sustainability standards necessitates exploring management's role in creating value for businesses, society, and nature. They assert that performance can be enhanced through strategic management, focusing on its dimensions: strategy process, strategy content, and strategy context. Together, these perspectives underscore the complexity and multifaceted approach required to align corporate sustainability with international guidelines while considering diverse local interpretations and strategic management practices.",

            "ground_truth": "Hahn et al., Baumgartner and Rauter, and Crisóstomo et al. collectively emphasize the multifaceted approach required to enhance corporate sustainability performance. Hahn et al. highlight the importance of diverse team settings, suggesting that a mix of business case-minded individuals and those with a strong awareness of environmental and social issues can lead to more successful sustainability outcomes than teams dominated by either perspective alone. Complementing this, Baumgartner and Rauter focus on the role of strategic management in achieving corporate sustainability, advocating for a comprehensive exploration of strategy process, content, and context to create value for businesses, society, and nature. Further expanding on the factors influencing sustainability, Crisóstomo et al. identify key determinants such as ownership concentration, sector risk, profitability, firm size, growth opportunities, and debt, suggesting that these elements play a crucial role in shaping a company's sustainability performance. Together, these insights underscore the need for a diverse, strategically managed, and contextually aware approach to corporate sustainability.",
