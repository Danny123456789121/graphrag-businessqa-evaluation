# Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Disclosures: A Meta-Analytical Review

# Abstract

Purpose – This study investigates the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures.

Design/methodology/approach – Data Analysis has been conducted on 29 prior studies published between 2004 and 2016 for the purpose of integrating the findings across studies. The study uses the meta-analysis instrument developed by Hunter et al. (1982).

Findings – The investigation finds a significant positive association between board size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility with Corporate Social Disclosures (CSD). Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership are insignificantly and positively associated with CSD. CEO duality is also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study further investigates that the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study.

Originality/value – This paper adds significance to the extant academic literature as well as assisting the appropriate policy maker in assessing the determinants of corporate social disclosures from the viewpoints of corporate governance. It further aims to reconcile the findings of the previous studies around the world, and also for the developed and developing countries separately.

# 1. Introduction

Due to several corporate scandals (for example, Enron, Ahold, WorldCom, Lehman Brothers and Parmalat), recent financial crisis, and changing the mix of the business environment with the rising demand from various stakeholders have brought more devotion to the corporate governance (CG) and corporate social disclosures (CSD). Corporate governance and social disclosures are related to each other (Haniffa and Cooke, 2005, Said et al., 2009, Kathy Rao et al., 2012). CG ensures the interest of the shareholders, and it plays a vital role to the corporate accountability by disclosing social issues (Hossain and Alam, 2016). Dellaportas et al. (2012) find if the disclosure level of the organization increases, it will create advantages for that organization. As a result, every company should disclose their economic, social and environmental activities to their valuable stakeholders (Said et al., 2009).

The meaning of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CSD differ in the context of various stakeholder groups and companies around the world (Dawkins and Lewis, 2003, Igalens and Gond, 2005, Welford et al., 2008). As a country, USA is the pioneer in the arena of CSR and CSD (Giannarakis, 2014b) and companies in that country still meets the desire of their shareholders by providing CSD as a voluntary disclosure (Tschopp, 2005, Rodríguez and LeMaster, 2007). The evidence shows that a number of research connected to CSD have investigated in the developed and developing countries. But, much of the evidence of previous literature provides qualitative descriptions regarding the nature, contents and motivational factors of CSD (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001, Newson and Deegan, 2002, Campbell, 2007, Van Beurden and Gössling, 2008, Uzma, 2016, Neu et al., 1998, Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975, Teoh and Thong, 1984, Guthrie and Parker, 1989, Andrew et al., 1989, Guthrie and Parker, 1990, Roberts, 1992, Patten, 1992, Clarkson, 1995, Donaldson and Preston, 1995, Deegan and Gordon, 1996, Adams et al., 1998, Adams et al., 1995, Deegan and Rankin, 1997).

In the existing literature, a microscopic research has been investigated on the determinants of CSD as well, e.g., (Hackston and Milne, 1996, Alnajjar, 2000, Naser et al., 2006, Hawani Wan Abd Rahman et al., 2011, Giannarakis, 2013, Muttakin and Khan, 2014, Giannarakis, 2014b, Barakat et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Nurhayati et al., 2016).

Moreover, there is relatively less devotion has been given to set up a direct link between CG and CSD (Khan et al., 2013, Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Sufian and Zahan, 2013, Giannarakis, 2014a, Kiliç et al., 2015, Deschênes et al., 2015, Majeed et al., 2015, D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Dunn and Sainty, 2009, Ibrahim and Hanefah, 2016, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007).

The empirical findings of the previous literature in connection to CG and CSD provide inconclusive results. For example, Dunn and Sainty (2009) and Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016) provide evidence that board independence has a significant impact on CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Razak and Mustapha (2013) suggests that no significant impact of board independence on CSD. Besides that, Javaid Lone et al. (2016) documented that there is a significant link between board size and CSD. However, Razak and Mustapha (2013) show the insignificant relationship between board size and CSD. In addition, Majeed et al. (2015) find that board gender diversity has a significant impact on CSD.

side, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) provide evidence that no significant impact exists between board gender diversity and CSD.

Contrary to previous findings above, our study aims to address the meta-analysis technique for finding out the links on the corporate governance and corporate social disclosures. In this context, this paper synthesizes 29 previous studies by conducting the meta-analysis technique developed by Hunter et al. (1982) to give a fruitful result on the CG and CSD relationship.

The social science researcher is more devoting on the use of meta-analysis technique but limited applications by the researcher of accounting (Eddine et al., 2015, Khlif and Souissi, 2010, Ahmed and Courtis, 1999). To the best of our awareness, no prior studies examined the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures by using the meta-analysis technique. Hence, this study contributes to the contemporary literature to fill up this research gap. Furthermore, the findings of the investigation present a combined result of the prior studies based on different countries which are ultimately providing a better understanding to assess the determinants of corporate social disclosures. Moreover, this meta-analysis technique adds contributions not only in the accounting research arena but also other areas of research.

In the present study, the meta-analysis incorporates twelve corporate governance variables as explanatory variables. These variables are board independence, board Size, board gender diversity, the frequency of board meetings, the composition of non-executive directors, CEO duality, auditors’ credibility, government ownership, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership, and concentrated ownership. The study results imply that there is a significant positive relationship exists between board Size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility with Corporate Social Disclosures (CSD). Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, there is an insignificant positive association finds between board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership. CEO duality is also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study further investigates that the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study. The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.

The rest parts of the article proceed as follows. The next section reviews the related previous literature. Section 3 includes the research methodology. Section 4 provides empirical results of the study. The last part highlights the concluding remarks and indicates future research directions.

# 2. Prior Literature

Based on the existing literature on the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures, the study considers a total of 12 independent variables for the meta-analysis as follows:

# Independent Variables

# Corporate Governance:

1. 2.1 Board Independence
2. 2.2 Board Size
3. 2.3 Board Gender Diversity
4. 2.4 Frequency of Board Meetings
5. 2.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors
6. 2.6 CEO Duality

Corporate Social Disclosures

# 2.1 Board Independence

Board independence indicates the percentage of independent directors on the board. Agency theory suggests that independent directors pay more attention to the interests of the shareholders at the time of board decision-making process (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Independent directors play a decisive role to dominate over the actions of the board of directors on corporate social responsibility matters (Abdullah et al., 2011). Therefore, independent directors ensure the efficient management of the companies as well as protect the interests of the shareholders (De Andres et al., 2005).

Some empirical examinations investigated the link between the board independence and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Dunn and Sainty, 2009, Ibrahim and Hanefah, 2016, Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Lim et al., 2008, Majeed et al., 2015, Kiliç et al., 2015, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Deschênes et al., 2015, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013). Prior literature finds mixed results. For example, Rashid and Lodh (2008), Dunn and Sainty (2009), Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016), Javaid Lone et al. (2016), Rashid and Lodh (2008), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Supriyono et al. (2015) find a significant positive relation between the board independence and CSD. In contrary, the studies of Razak and Mustapha (2013), Lim et al. (2008), and Nurhayati et al. (2016) show the insignificant positive relation between the board independence and CSD. In addition, some studies find an insignificant negative association between the board independence and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Majeed et al., 2015, Kiliç et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Barakat et al., 2015).

# 2.2 Board Size

Board size refers to the total number of directors on the company’s board. It considers as an effective monitoring tool of corporate governances (Lee and Chen, 2011). The inter-correlation between board size and reporting is complementary. The larger board size of a company tends to disclose more reporting activities (Samaha et al., 2012). However, a larger board is more efficient than the smaller ones but too larger board is ineffective for monitoring the business operations (Giannarakis, 2014a). It is expected that size of the board shows the management ability and reduce the information lopsidedness of the managers and stakeholders (Chen and Jaggi, 2001, Akhtaruddin et al., 2009). Akhtaruddin et al. (2009) also argue that the greater size of Directors indicates a diversification of expertise on the board because of their collective experience and therefore the disclosures quantity and quality will be higher. The existing literature provides a controversial association between board size and CSD. For example, some academicians find a significant positive relationship between board size and CSD (Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Majeed et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2013, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar, 2010, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Barakat et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2014b). In contrast, the studies of Razak and Mustapha (2013), Kiliç et al. (2015), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Ling and Sultana (2015) show insignificant and positive impacts of board size on CSD. In addition, Dunn and Sainty (2009), Sufian and Zahan (2013), and Giannarakis (2013) find an insignificant negative relationship.

# 2.3 Board Gender Diversity

It indicates the percentage of women directors on the board. The presence of female directors besides male directors on the board plays a vital role to increase the reputation of the company by engaging with social issues (Bear et al., 2010). Prior literature suggests that women are more sensitive to the society (Burgess and Tharenou, 2002). As a result, they increase board’s focus on CSR related issues (Ayuso and Argandoña, 2009) and charitable giving (Williams, 2003). Hence, it is predicted that there is a positive association between board gender diversity and CSD. But, the prior literature shows inconclusive results. For example, Giannarakis (2014a), Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016), and Javaid Lone et al. (2016) find a significant positive relation between women directors on the board and CSD whereas Majeed et al. (2015) finds a negative and significant association between female directors and CSD. In addition, some authors report that there is an insignificant positive impact of female directors on the CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Khan, 2010, Giannarakis, 2014b), while Kiliç et al. (2015) finds an insignificant negative relationship.

# 2.4 Frequency of Board Meetings

The frequency of board meetings indicates the total number of board meetings which is a proxy of the board activeness to handle organizational issues (Khanchel, 2007). Nowadays, corporate social problems are a crucial matter for the stakeholders. Hence, it is expected that CSR-related topics are discussed at each meeting of the board to protect the interests of the

# 2.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs)

It refers to the percentage of non-executive directors (NEDs) to total directors on the board. The existence of NEDs on the board is crucial because they have the proficiencies and knowledge to judge the issues arise in the meetings (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016). The ability of the NEDs is uncertain regarding governance issues (Myllys, 1999). But, NEDs can supervise to the board of directors when they observe that the act of the executive directors’ against the shareholder's interest (Jensen and Meckling, 1976, Forker, 1992). The empirical literature provides evidence that the diversity of the board of directors enhance corporate social disclosures (Siciliano, 1996). Some studies find a significant positive relationship between NEDs and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Khan, 2010, Lim et al., 2008), whereas Haniffa and Cooke (2005) finds a negative and significant association. In contrast, few studies provide no connection between NEDs and CSD (Haniffa and Cooke, 2002, Cullen and Christopher, 2002).

# 2.6 CEO Duality

CEO duality means the person who serves as a CEO of the company as well as the chairman of the company’s board. Prior literature measures CEO duality by taking a dummy variable equal to one when the same person serves as a CEO as well as the chairman and zero otherwise. CEO duality provides a person strong power in the decision-making process. As a result, the person does not consider the interests of the shareholders so much, and firm social activities including disclosures may be lowered (Haniffa and Cooke, 2002). Therefore, the position of CEO and chairman should be separated as it increases the monitoring quality of the issues relating to stakeholders (Li et al., 2008). However, the previous literature finds inconclusive results on the link between CEO duality and CSD. For example, some studies find a significant negative association between CEO duality and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014b, Ling and Sultana, 2015). In contrary, Razak and Mustapha (2013) and Lim et al. (2008) find an insignificant negative relationship between CEO duality and CSD. In addition, the study of Giannarakis (2014a) provides an evidence of insignificant positive impact of CEO duality on CSD.

# 2.7 Auditors’ Credibility

Auditors’ credibility of any firm indicates its audit quality that is the firm audited by the big audit firm (Big-four). It is predicted that Big-four audit firm conduct their audit activities

sincerely (Owusu-Ansah, 1998) and Big-audit firms increase the credibility of their audited work on the annual reports (Patton and Zelenka, 1997). According to agency theory, auditor plays an effective monitoring tool on the conflict of agent-principal relationship (Lim et al., 2008). Auditors’ credibility such as their suggestions, approval of choosing accounting policies and explanations of vital issues influences on the company’s attitude regarding reporting and disclosure practices (Khan et al., 2013). However, the existing literature shows mixed results on the relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. For example, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) find a significant positive association between auditor’s credibility and CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Lu and Abeysekera (2014) provide evidence of an insignificant positive relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. Furthermore, Ling and Sultana (2015), and Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) find insignificant negative impact of auditors’ credibility on CSD. Prior researchers measure this variable by considering a dummy variable equal to one if a company is audited by one of the Big-four audit firms and zero otherwise.

# 2.8 Diversity of Ownership

# 2.8.1 Government Ownership

Prior literature measures government ownership in different ways. It means the percentage of shares owned by the government (Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Naser et al., 2006, Suwaidan et al., 2004, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010). Some of the researchers measure it by taking a dummy variable equal to one if the company is a government company and zero otherwise (Lim et al., 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014). As a government-owned company, it has to aware of the interests of the public and so should disclose more social related activities because government operations are always monitored by the public (Mohd Ghazali, 2007). As government body is politically sensitive and trusted by the people, it has to create more pressure on the companies for disclosing information related to stakeholders (Muttakin and Subramaniam, 2015). Hence, it is predicted that government ownership affects significantly and positively on CSD. But, the previous empirical literature provides mixed results. For example, Suwaidan et al. (2004), Mohd Ghazali (2007), and Lim et al. (2008), Mohd Ghazali (2007) find a significant positive association between government ownership and CSD. Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) find a significant negative relationship between government ownership and CSD. In contrast, some academicians find that there is a positive and insignificant relationship exists between government ownership and CSD (Ahmed Haji, 2013, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014, Naser et al., 2006, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010).

# 2.8.2 Foreign Ownership

The greater percentage of foreign ownership of a company indicates more intention to practice foreign rules and regulations (Jeon et al., 2011). Bradbury (1991), and Haniffa and Cooke (2005) argue that stronger foreign ownership creates geographic distance among the owners and so higher level of disclosure expected from the shareholders of the foreign countries. Prior literature measures this variable in two different ways. Some researchers consider the percentage of shares owned by the foreign shareholders for measuring foreign

# 2.8.3 Institutional Ownership

It indicates the percentage of shares owned by the institutional investors. Institutional owners play a fundamental role in changing corporate management behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Institutional investors treated as majority shareholders and they influence to the management for disclosing more information (Naser et al., 2006). Prior literature shows mixed results. For example, Majeed et al. (2015) find a significant positive relation between institutional ownership and CSD. On the other hand, Li and Zhang (2010) and Nurhayati et al. (2016) find an insignificant positive association between institutional owners and CSD. In addition, Naser et al. (2006), and Rashid and Lodh (2008) provide evidence of an insignificant negative relationship between institutional ownership and CSD.

# 2.8.4 Managerial Ownership

Managerial ownership indicates the percentage of shares owned by the directors. In an owner-managed company, the interests of the outsiders are relatively small, and the disclosures of CSR information may be less (Mohd Ghazali, 2007). Eng and Mak (2003) find that the lower percentage of managerial ownership increases disclosures information. Hence, it is expected that there is a negative relationship between managerial ownership and CSD. Prior literature supports the negative association between managerial ownership and CSD. But, some studies find a significant impact of managerial ownership on CSD (Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007), whereas Ahmed Haji (2013), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Supriyono et al. (2015) find an insignificant relationship between managerial ownership and CSD.

# 2.8.5 Concentrated Ownership

Concentrated ownership indicates the possession which occupied by few shareholders or family members (Mohd Ghazali and Weetman, 2006). It is a necessary component of effective corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). According to agency theory, the widely dispersed ownership company faces more agency-principal conflicts (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Accordingly, public accountability becomes vital for the widely held companies because these enterprises have a greater chance of being detained by the public as a whole (Mohd Ghazali, 2007) and such companies have to provide substantial social information (Ahmed Haji, 2013). Hence, it is our expectation that concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures (CSD) express the significant negative relationship. Prior academic literature has scrutinized on the relationship between concentrated ownership and CSD, and the previous results provide controversial findings. For example, Lu and...

Abeysekera (2014) finds a significant negative relationship between concentrated ownership and CSD. In Contrary, Sufian and Zahan (2013), and Majeed et al. (2015) find an insignificant and positive association between concentrated ownership and CSD. In addition, some studies found insignificant and negative impact of concentrated ownership on CSD (Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007, Li and Zhang, 2010, Naser et al., 2006).

# 3. Research Methodology

# 3.1 Sample

For the meta-analysis, the previous 29 studies published ranging from 2004 to 2016 yielding 5437 sample size has considered. All of the articles in the meta-analysis has been collected from the top journal publishers around the world to select the studies which examine the determinants of corporate social disclosures in the context of corporate governance. The study gives importance on the good impact factor journals or books abstracted and indexed by the Thomson Reuters, The Association of Business Schools (ABS), Scopus, and Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) databases. The characteristics of the selected sample studies have shown in Tables 1 & 2.

[Insert Table 1]

[Insert Table 2]

# 3.2 Research Instrument

This study attempts to conduct the meta-analysis technique of Hunter et al. (1982) to reconcile the mixed results of conflicting views of the prior studies. In the current study, the meta-analysis methodology is also a similar nature of other researchers (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990, Rosenthal, 1991, Ahmed and Courtis, 1999, Khlif and Souissi, 2010, Souissi and Khlif, 2012, Eddine et al., 2015, Siddiqui, 2015).

The narrative analysis of the previous literature is not appropriate because the nature of the previous studies vary due to variations of sample size, time, country and other characteristics. Moreover, researchers found different results from various studies (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). According to Ahmed and Courtis (1999), “Meta-analysis enables to give consistent results and overcome the problems of narrative findings.” Meta-analysis is a statistical technique to reconcile the mixed results of the prior studies (Souissi and Khlif, 2012) and it evaluates the different consequences of the results from the previous studies (García-Meca and Sánchez-Ballesta, 2009). The best definition provided by Glass (1976) as of meta-analysis is a technique by which the findings of the extensive collection of studies accumulated.

In the existing literature of meta-analysis technique, the degree of association between dependent and independent variables are measured using the effect size which is called the coefficient of correlation (r). In this paper, the value of r is calculated for each study sample to measure effect size of each explanatory variable. The value of r is computed based on t-

# 4. Empirical Results

Table 3 summarizes the meta-analysis results of all the explanatory variables. The table shows whether there is any significant or insignificant impact of CG on CSD. In addition, Table 4 to Table 6 explains the subgroups analysis of the studies on the basis of the developed and developing countries (where applicable). The subgrouping analysis assists in removing heterogeneity (Eddine et al., 2015).

[Insert Table 3]

The empirical results have analyzed separately for each variable as follows:

# 4.1 Board Independence

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.086, 95% confidence interval -0.1863; 0.3583) between board independence and CSD using 3620 sample sizes of 17 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The results is similar with Razak and Mustapha (2013), Lim et al. (2008), and Nurhayati et al. (2016). To test the heterogeneity, the chi-square statistic applies here. The chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 88.33) is significant (p < 0.01) which means homogeneity test is rejected. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 19.25% of the observed variance. Therefore, further analysis needed to remove heterogeneity and in Table 4, we split the total studies into developed and developing countries. Both the studies of developed (𝑟 = 0.1737, 95% confidence interval -0.0675; 0.4145) and developing (𝑟 = 0.0698, 95% confidence interval -0.1968; 0.3364) countries indicates an insignificant positive association. The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between board independence and CSD due to the differences of country of study.

[Insert Table 4]

# 4.2 Board Size

Table 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 = 0.1209, 95% confidence interval 0.0425; 0.1993) board size and CSD using 2228 sample sizes of 15 studies. This result is consistent with other researchers, e.g., (Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Majeed et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2014b, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar, 2010, Barakat et al., 2015). In addition, the chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 18.69) indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 80.25% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problems, no further analysis needed.

# 4.3 Board Gender Diversity

The overall meta-analysis results on the association between board gender diversity and CSD are presented in Table 3. Using 2081 sample size of 9 studies provide an evidence of an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1039, 95% confidence interval -0.0820; 0.2898). Similar results find by D.Sundarasen et al. (2016), Giannarakis (2014a), Khan (2010), and Giannarakis (2014b). The chi-square statistic applies here to check the heterogeneity. The chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 28.29) is significant (p < 0.01) which means homogeneity test is rejected. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 31.82% of the observed variance. Therefore, we split the total studies into developed and developing countries to remove heterogeneity in Table 5. The studies of developed countries provide significant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0695, 95% confidence interval 0.0107; 0.1283) consistent with Deschênes et al. (2015). In contrast, the studies of developing countries indicate an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1198, 95% confidence interval -0.0940;

# 4.4 Frequency of Board Meetings

The overall meta-analysis results for the frequency of board meetings of Table 3 show a mean correlation (𝑟) of 0.0399 with the 95% confidence interval between 0.0399 and 0.0399 indicates a significant positive association with CSD. The result is inconsistent with other studies. The chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 2.05) of Table 3 indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 100% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problem, no further analysis needed.

# 4.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0575, 95% confidence interval -0.1865; 0.3015) between composition of non-executive directors and CSD using 1362 sample sizes of 4 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is inconsistent with other studies. The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.6 CEO Duality

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant negative association (𝑟 = -0.077, 95% confidence interval -0.1994; 0.0454) between CEO duality and CSD using 2130 sample sizes of 7 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. Similar result find by Razak and Mustapha (2013) and Lim et al. (2008). In addition, the chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 15.53) of Table 3 indicates the existence of heterogeneity. Therefore, the sub-group analysis (Table-6) has divided the studies into developed and developing countries. Both the studies of developed (𝑟 = -0.1092, 95% confidence interval -0.2532; 0.0348) and developing (𝑟 = -0.0654, 95% confidence interval -0.1691; 0.0383) countries indicates an insignificant negative association. The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between CEO duality and CSD due to the differences of country of study.

# 4.7 Auditors’ Credibility

Table 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 = 0.059, 95% confidence interval 0.059; 0.059) auditors’ credibility and CSD using 1564 sample sizes of 5 studies. This result is consistent with D.Sundarasen et al. (2016). In addition, the chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 3.75) indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error.

# 4.8 Diversity of Ownership

# 4.8.1 Government Ownership

Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1724, 95% confidence interval -- 0.0920; 0.4368) between government ownership and CSD using 1332 sample sizes of 8 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with other studies (Ahmed Haji, 2013, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014, Naser et al., 2006, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.8.2 Foreign Ownership

The meta-analysis results of Table 3 shows an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1735, 95% confidence interval -0.0439; 0.3909) between foreign ownership and CSD using 326 sample sizes of 4 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with Sufian and Zahan (2013). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.8.3 Institutional Ownership

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 presents an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0261, 95% confidence interval -0.0472; 0.0994) between institutional ownership and CSD using 993 sample sizes of 5 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with Li and Zhang (2010) and (Nurhayati et al., 2016). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.8.4 Managerial Ownership

The overall meta-analysis results for the managerial ownership of Table 3 show a mean correlation (𝑟) of -0.1289 with the 95% confidence interval between -0.1289 and -0.1289 indicates a significant negative association with CSD. Similar findings find by Razak and Mustapha (2013), Rashid and Lodh (2008), and Mohd Ghazali (2007). The chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 4.89) of Table 3 indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 100% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problem, no further analysis needed.

# 4.8.5 Concentrated Ownership

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 identifies a significant negative association (𝑟 = -0.022, 95% confidence interval -0.022; -0.022) between concentrated ownership and CSD using 1165 sample sizes of 7 studies. The result is consistent with Lu and Abeysekera (2014). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 5. Concluding Remarks and Future Research Directions

The study investigates the impacts of corporate governance (CG) variables on the corporate social disclosures (CSD). Prior studies used meta-analysis technique to determine the determinants of CSD but in different ways. Also, this is the first meta-analytical review on the relationship between CG and CSD. Hence, the study incorporates the result of 29 previous studies on the link between CG and CSD. In the present paper, we include 12 explanatory variables of corporate governance such as board independence, board Size, board gender diversity, the frequency of board meetings, the composition of non-executive directors, CEO duality, auditors’ credibility, government ownership, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership, and concentrated ownership.

The results of the comprehensive meta-analysis found that board Size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility are significantly and positively associated with CSD. Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership are insignificantly and positively associated with CSD. CEO duality also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study also uses the sub-grouping analysis based on country differences. The findings indicate that only the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study. The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.

Although this study is the first meta-analytical review for examining the impact of CG on CSD, the study faces limitations as well. It excludes the various corporate characteristics as determinants of CSD. Therefore, further study should investigate by considering all of the variables besides CG like firm size, leverage, profitability, firm age, industry type, etc. Regardless of these limitations, we predict that the empirical findings of this study will be beneficial for the future researcher to develop the theory on the link between CG and CSD.
