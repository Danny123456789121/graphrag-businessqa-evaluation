# Abstract

Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation causes failures of the sustainability policy. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of the present study is to explore the factors that create hurdles in the implementation of corporate sustainability policy in letters and spirits. The study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) approach and reviews all the possible studies from 1950 to 2019 published by six major publishing houses. These studies were found using selected keywords. The findings of SLR reveal governance, education, and SMEs as frequently appearing words while exploring corporate sustainability. The stakeholder theory and the institutional theory appear as the most cited theories in the sustainability literature. The grassroots approach, environmental impact assessment, integrated sustainability assessment, evidence-based practice approach, systematic approach, economical instrument policy approach, and consultant services approach appear as the most relevant approaches used for policymaking in corporate sustainability. The SLR findings reveal five significant factors that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation and can cause the gap between policy and its implementation. These factors are government institutions (including macro and meso-institutions), internal and external stakeholders, management, organizational barriers, and normative references.

# Introduction

Corporate sustainability (CS) has become a part of the business community’s vernacular worldwide. The origin of the CS concept is mainly linked to the Brundtland report (1987), which incorporates CS through the triple bottom line of long-term economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility into a company’s management and operations (Bansal 2005). Despite the effective policymaking on CS, its implementation is frequently questioned. Since the policymaking and implementation are two different realms (Galbreath 2009), both aspects need to be equally reinforced for productive results. Kotler (2001) mentioned that the policy’s implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organization’s objectives. Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation is one of the core reasons for sustainability policy’s failure. Further, since the policies are written documents, these cannot be implemented in the real organizational setting without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication down the line to the implementation team (Ménard et al. 2018).

Organizational policies for long-term growth give an apex position to sustainability (Perrini and Minoja 2008). The reason for the importance of CS in decision-making can be traced back to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, S. W. S 1987). The report titled “Our

Common Future considers sustainability as the key driver for the prosperous global future for present and future generations. The report strongly suggests the corporate sector to focus on sustainable policies to meet the need of the present generation without harming future generations’ ability to meet their own needs.

The challenges to corporate sustainability are continual and require exploring new sustainable approaches (Alexander 2020) to overcome them (Raja et al. 2019). Especially at the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) level, it is crucial to see as to why the execution of policy remains a dilemma. Whether these are internal capabilities of a firm like dependability, flexibility, and future technology improvement (Caldera et al. 2019) or the external factors like governmental laws and regulations that affect an SMEs’ sustainability (Kumar and Saravanan 2017; Yang and Ha-Brookshire 2019). It requires a comprehensive review of the sustainability research to explore factors that play an intermittent role between formulated policies and their implementation. This way may provide plausible solutions to tackle the intermittent factors which cause damages to sustainability policy (Fischer et al. 2020; Jang 2020).

Sustainability encompasses three dimensions. First, organizations need to become socially responsible, the second organization needs to be environmentally friendly, and third, the organizations should create wealth for the shareholder. In this context, CS practices can simultaneously create benefits for society and profit maximization for shareholders in an environmentally driven business situation (Al Am 2016; Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013). Furthermore, CS practices also better all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, contractors, community members, positive impact on the environment, and shareholder value maximization (Miska et al. 2018). Hence these practices improve reputation, reliability, and good relationship with stakeholders (Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013; Moktadir et al. 2018).

There are a thousand of initiatives practiced by private organizations for societal and environmental improvement. International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) (n.d.-a, b), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are among those who provide generic guidelines and are recognized by the governments and implementing in their countries according to their need and priority (Klettner et al. 2014). Despite having extensive policy frameworks to ensure sustainable corporate practices, their implementation is grossly missing. According to crude estimates, a few percent of the businesses truly execute the CS policies. Many organizations do greenwashing by showing some charity and environmental driven steps (Ramus and Montiel 2005). It raises a serious question of whether the CS policies are overambitious or the organizations are reluctant to implement them (Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2010).

Janaina et al. (2020) argued that decision-makers must understand local management practices and concepts instead of imposing challenging requirements on local companies and society. The growing demand for eco-friendly products invites the textile companies to search for diverse environmental instruments to fulfill the demand of customers who look for a sustainable product. In this way, companies can sustainably gain a premium price to enhance profit in a promising way (Hayat et al. 2020).

There may be some other factors due to which the CS policies may not be translated into actions. The present study undertakes this task by comprehensively reviewing the literature on CS policies to draw the reasons for the literature’s lack of implementation. This study contributes to the much-needed debate of the gap between CS policies and their implementation. The study also contributes by providing the steps that can be instrumental in implementing CS policies. The subsequent section of the paper briefly entails the methodology adopted for the review.

# Material and method

The early research on sustainability started in the year 1950s (such as Bowen 1953). Therefore, we selected the studies published between the 1950 to 2020 period for this comprehensive review. We developed ten keywords to search the articles related to CS (see Table 1). The various combinations of these keywords were used to query the research articles from selected six databases (see Table 1). In the first search, 1224 papers were downloaded using the keywords or their combinations. After reading the titles, 845 research papers were retained as the rest of the papers were not directly linked with CS, CS policies and/or its implementation. In the second phase, abstracts of all 845 papers read and 107 articles were retained for the final review. The yearly detail of the article.

Governance appeared as a significant study area in all six publishers; education and SMEs appeared as the second most essential study areas, followed by innovation, urban studies, EU policies, research, and innovation financial and fiscal studies.

Before proceeding further, it is imperative to discuss the different terminologies, which addresses CS’s concept. Researchers use interchangeable terminologies, such as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate philanthropy, corporate social performance, socially responsible behavior, corporate ethics, stakeholders management, corporate accountability to reflect the sustainability of a firm (Ahmed and Ahmed 2011; Barron 2010; Helleno et al. 2017; Miska et al. 2018; Pedersen 2006; Sheinbaum-Pardo et al. 2012). The stated terminologies represent the tri-dimensional concept of CS, including social, environmental, and economic dimensions. We use term CS in this paper to reflect the sustainability of a firm.

Inclusion criteria for this review studies are the social and environmental dimensions of CS carried out on policy and practice issues in SMEs, manufacturing, and services sectors.

We have divided the literature review section into five sub-sections. The “Introduction” section gives a brief profile of CS concept, the “Material and method” section addresses theoretical exposition, the “Literature review” section CS policy and practices, the “Results and discussion” section addresses different policy approaches, and finally, the “Concluding remarks” section addresses the factors affecting CS policy and practices.

# Literature review

# Profile of corporate sustainability

Over the last few decades, different researchers investigated the domain of social obligations of businesspersons. During the evolution of CS, Andrew Carnegie (1889), a businessperson/philanthropist, wrote an essay on the concept of social obligation, wherein he emphasized the wealthy class of society needs the philanthropic/well-being of the poor (laborers) who are trying to bring social change in their lives. People in business need to understand the difference between social responsibility and charity (Clark 1916); he further added that the problem is not helping society’s deprived class. However, it is the approach and perspective of businessmen who help the under privileged class with charity rather than business responsibility. Berle (1932), in his scholastic note, calls for the attention of the trust factor between business and societal well-being. Abrams (1951), Clark (1926), and Kreps (1940) also discussed the social obligation of businesspersons.

In subsequent decades, scholars further extended the research work of the social responsibility of business organizations. Howard Bowen is considered the father of CSR in the western world (Carroll 1999; Türkel and Akan 2015). In 1953, Howard Bowen argued for business organizations’ social obligation and explained that CS practices brought a competitive advantage for the organization.

Since the early years, the concept of CS remained a complex—known as social responsibility in the 1950s and 1960s. Davis (1960) explained that business leaders could deal with the social responsibility of the businesses in the next fifty years.

# Policy and practice of corporate sustainability

The popularity of CS influenced the policy and planning approaches (McLean and Borén 2015). Perrini and Minoja (2008) emphasized that corporate behavior towards sustainability has gained a central position among sustainability-conscious decision-makers. Policy formulation and implementation are two different domains (Galbreath 2009), and according to Kotler (2001), policy implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organizational objectives. Therefore, despite focusing on sustainability policy and planning, failures in the implementation phase occur up to some extent; one reason for the failure of sustainability policy is the gap between policy and its implementation. In view, Ménard et al. (2018) argued that policies are written documents, and, without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication cannot be implemented in the contexts.

It is rare in literature how to make a policy coherent with all three dimensions of CS (Klettner et al. 2014); thus, when management device policies and when it implements, most of the time it lacks (Spiller and Savedoff 1999). One core gap, which causes flaws, is the lack of leadership commitment and the clarification/understanding of policy. Ménard et al. (2018) argued that meso-institutions are responsible for the implementation and operationalization of policies; if not adequately addressed the policy, then they mislead and end up with gaps between policy and practice.

There are several contributing factors to the success or failure of policies. Roosa (2007) argued that sustainability policy’s objectives and goals could not be achieved without the contribution and successful nexus of stakeholders (citizens) and the policymaking authorities.

Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet (2010) argued that gaps between policies and practices occur particularly in developing countries due to unrealistic thinking, overambitious policies, objectives that are distant from reality, local culture, norms and values of society. Unrealistic policies end-up with gaps when these policies come to the level of implementation. Ménard et al. (2018) also argued that some part of the gap arises due to poor performance of meso-institutions.

Bonn and Fisher (2011) explained that CS is the missing part of the policy, and it must be incorporated in the organizations’ strategic decisions. Corporate policy and CS policy of the organization in the form of a single organizational strategy can address problems of environmental and social dimensions along with profit maximization (Engert et al. 2016). Baumgartner (2014) said that making a CS policy is not the only important factor, but how to implement the same is even more essential.

Despite the popularity of CS and its priority in the western world, one single generic policy encompassing CS and organizational strategy may not be equally adaptable for all.

organizations due to the specific needs and demands of differ-

ent stakeholders. Hence, the companies’ management has to

put their efforts and look into their particular needs while

formulating the policies (Bos Brouwers 2010; Gouldson and

Sullivan 2007; Springett 2003). One more area which needs

attention is that when policymakers need to choose one among

environment and economic dimension; policymakers always

supersede the economic dimension over the environmental

dimension. Paulraj (2009) argued that commitment to the pol-

icy and implementation of the policy are two different and

independent factors, and companies opt the minimum of legal

compliances and try to resolve the environmental issues.

However, from the perspective of developing countries, it

varies from country to country according to their needs and

demands (Abreu 2009).

With the passage of time, most companies have started

adopting the CS, instead of avoiding it as the management

of the companies has realized that by adopting CS, efficiency

and productivity of the company may be increased (Jnr et al.

2019). However, to become a responsible organization in the

business community, it requires planning in the realm of

policymaking and implementation, which may not only take

the organization beyond the profitmaking and legal compli-

ance but also provides the opportunity to work for the mitiga-

tion of risk aversion and bridging gaps between business and

society (Morgan et al. 2009). Furthermore, CS addresses the

issues of well-being and environmental degradation. It also

guides management to resolve the core problems related to

their products (Werther and Chandler 2010).

# Corporate sustainability policy approaches

There are several underlying approaches to develop a policy

for CS. Researchers contributed different ideas in this realm;

all have their rationale and significance. Scholars have

discussed different approaches (Klettner et al. 2014).

Pedersen (2006) stressed that in social responsibility, the par-

ticipatory approach has five elements to understand the dia-

logue between social responsibility and stakeholders; it

includes inclusion, openness, tolerance, empowerment, and

transparency.

Davies (2009) suggested the idea of a Grassroots approach

through environmental education on grassroots and

community-based interventions. The Environmental Impact

Assessment Approach is another avenue for policy planning,

which integrates policy appraisal and supports sustainable de-

velopment more than the sectoral appraisal system. This ap-

proach provides rational and quality information for decision-

making. Integrated Sustainability Assessment approach for

sustainable development policymaking is participatory and

based on a participatory cyclic process of scoping,

envisioning, experimenting, and learning through the shared

interpretation of sustainability; it helps to develop and apply in

an integrated manner in the context (Whitmarsh et al. 2009).

Evidence-based policymaking is another approach, but as

the perspective of business sectors and its context complicates

the application of this approach (Jasanoff 2009; Radaelli

1995; Nutley et al. 2007). The practice approach is another

idea for the CS policy and strategy; it recommends that the

attention of companies is to be on the practice (Guohui and

Eppler 2008). A systematic approach is also an integral ap-

proach; its impact is widespread in all sectors, especially in the

construction industry (Davies 2009). The systematic approach

is the holistic idea in such a sector because today’s decision

must have room for alteration for future generations (Hendriks

2004). Fischer (2000) argued that the systematic approach

advocates for participatory decision-making instead of solo

decisions. This approach suggests taking the input of stake-

holders for better decisions; by doing so, stakeholder’s per-

spective adds insight wisdom to the process from the end-user

point of view; by this approach, policy and planning can

become comprehensive.

The economic instrument policy approach is also

supporting in controlling environmental pollution. Bailey

(1999) and Kennedy (1996) argued that business organization

internalizes the cost of pollution that they create in this ap-

proach. Clarke and Roome (1999) emphasize the role of in-

termediaries in the adaption of environmental practices. In

order to know the feasible option for SMEs, the

intermediaries/consultants can provide access to readily avail-

able expert knowledge to SMEs and can contribute and in-

crease their absorptive capacity.

Achieving, sustainability goal in all sectors of human

endeavor; requires a quality decision process for policy

management, which includes significant ongoing informa-

tion gathering, processing, and disseminating efforts

(Clark 2009). There are five different types of sustainabil-

ity impacts identified on governance modes: (i) centralized

governance, (ii) decentralized governance, (iii) public-

private partnership, (iv) interactive governance, (v) self-

regulation (Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).

They explained the earlier two are traditional command-

and-control approaches of policy. Driessen et al. (2012)

further explained that, in the centralized-mode of policy,

the central government’s role is crucial, and the

decentralized-mode of policy is cantonal. They further ex-

plained in the public-private partnership mode of policy

that the role of the public sector organization is to interact

with privates’ associations for policymaking. The fourth

mode of governance is the collaborative governance

among the public sector, private sector, and civil society

on an equal basis. The final mode of governance is self-

regulation. Deakin and Hobbs (2007) argue that self-

regulation model is an opportunity for a business organi-

zation to embed in society.

# Factors affecting corporate sustainability policy and practices

In the literature review, multiple factors were identified which affected policymaking and implementation of technological change and influence societal practices (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018). Fairbrass (2011) mentioned that government/public authorities need policy debate with interested parties comprised of different stakeholders in policymaking.

# Role of government/public sector institutions

Keeping in view the critique of Friedman (1962), the social dimension is not the responsibility of the business organization; however, governments through legislation may control the business organizations to comply with a social dimension. The report of Brundtland et al. (1987) also identified that government should control the careless use of natural resources, which creates an adverse effect on the environment. In this context, the role of the governments is essential for the implementation and monitoring of CS. In recent years to become competitive in the international market, the Chinese regulatory authorities have forced Chinese companies to adopt CS (Zhu 2016).

Among the emerging economies the manufacturing sector is highly energy intensive sector. Thus, it is essential to look into the CS issues (Yu et al. 2017). The industrial growth in China has produced a huge volume of Carbon Dioxide and is considered the most resource-consuming and polluting country. China can bring immense improvement in global environmental issues (Feng et al. 2018).

Busch and Hoffmann (2009) and Luan et al. (2013) emphasized that government plays an instrumental role in putting the firms on track for eco-friendly attitude. Ecoprofit, an Austrian-based initiative, helps SMEs in reducing the environmental impact of SMEs. The company has implemented number of energy conservation projects with the help of local government (Beise and Rennings 2005; Rennings et al. 2006; van Hemel and Cramer 2002). Likewise, in Manali, an Indian tourism destination, stakeholders’ efforts failed to achieve their environmental objectives due to the local government’s lack of interest. Gardner and Sinclair (2003) explained that the role of the state was crucial in eradicating the pollution problems. In another example of government intervention to improve the environmental conditions, Xanthos and Walker (2017) described that pollution problems had compelled the governments to devise laws/policies to overcome the pollution problems.

The role of local government was also crucial in the implementation of policies (Sinclair and Fenton 1997) comparing the Canadian National Packaging Protocol and the European Parliament Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. They identified that the EU and Canada policies were weak as there was a lack of obligation at the province level in Canada and member states level in the EU. Another view of policymaking is environmental taxation, which can bring desirable change in the right direction. This approach can contribute in long terms.

# Organizational barriers

For better implementation of CS policies, researchers identified multiple factors. A study of CS in the Chinese manufacturing industry (Orji 2019) identified twelve barriers, wherein eleven are organizational barriers. These barriers include inefficient, poor, and inadequate plans, poor waste management, low suppliers selection, lack of finances, inferior technology, lack of top management commitment, communication gap, lack of training, lack of awareness among stakeholders, insufficient environmental compliances, and absence of good employee welfare plans. Several other researchers also identified these organizational barriers in their studies (Klewitz et al. 2012; Nykvist and Nilsson 2009; Moore 2005; Orji 2019; Trianni et al. 2017).

Engert et al. (2016) argue that companies must take the initiative to incorporate CS in their policies. Managers must create a learning environment or learning organization where employees interact with CS’s environmental and social dimensions. Nykvist and Nilsson (2009) mentioned that an organizational barrier includes lack of adequate time, expertise, resources, and availability of sufficient data for decision-making; and some structural barriers, which include the behavior of the policymaker, and the business sector is also one factor that affects the policy implementation process. Policy management has two essential factors, first is policy formulation, and the second is its implementation (Mintzberg and Waters 1985). Companies have developed sufficient skills in devising the policies; whereas the implementation of the policy still lacks (Zahn 1979), which causes the gap between the policy and its implementation.

# Self-regulation/subsidiarity/reflexive laws

The subsidiarity approach in environmental issues advocates for addressing and resolving the environmental problems at the local level within the member states of the EU, preferably with the participation of local authorities and citizens (Collier 1997). CS practice is an opportunity for business organizations, through which businesses can embed themselves in society by addressing social needs. This opportunity is not stringent, and it is based on reflexive law/self-regulation (Deakin and Hobbs 2007). In reality, CS practices are still not adopted in business processes. Once, If the CS issues are understood, businesses can avert risk and meet competitiveness (Deakin and Hobbs 2007; Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).

# Role of stakeholders

Stakeholders are the most influential actors in policy planning and implementation (Masurel 2007). Mathis (2007) examined the CS policy implementation in the dairy sector of the Netherland. He drew three inferences from the result of the study. First, he identified that a higher level of stakeholder management with the help of CS engagement allows business organizations to create a closer link with public authorities. Second, he identified that stakeholders influence the policymaking process. Third, the proactive approach towards CS policy in the private sector leads to self-regulation.

# Normative references

Kehbila et al. (2010) examined the state of environmental policy implementation in the South African Automotive Industry. Their study revealed that the South African Government was concerned for the country’s environmental condition, due to loss of biodiversity, land, disposal of waste, deterioration of air quality, noise pollution, and degradation of the marine environment. Kehbila et al. (2010) reported that large and SME sizes of automobile companies are operating in South Africa, and all are committed to maintaining the sustainability matters of automobile sectors. Results revealed that companies have ISO 14001 certification, ISO 9001 quality audit (external and internal), which includes SMEs. Dankova et al. (2015) explained three levels and types of standards being initiated/practices internationally, i.e., (i) sustainability standard based on political wills, such as UNGS, OECD ME, OECD CG, and GSC, (ii) CS standard based on professional judgment, such as SA8000 and ISO 26000, and (iii) CS reporting standards, such as GRI and EFFAS KPIs.

Environmental tax can bring desirable change policy interpretations/implementation in the business community. If not focused then it can cause misleading guidance and end-up better opportunities for stakeholders which compelled the governments, and countries to not stringent. In underdeveloped countries, lack of learning environment in organizational poor technologies, lack of management CS stimulate exponential positive employee behavior, workers behavior, information, commitment, institutional rules, accurate accounting with effective monitoring and regulatory support, and management on the environment and maximize the identified external and internal barriers. Government encompassing meaningful enforcement of CS laws through state arrangements are cosmetic (fudge). We ultimately need a framework from long-term technological change.

policymaking process. The more engage the stakeholders, and the more will influence the dialogue creates influences sustainability. Internal and external stakeholder pressure shape the policymaking process. In this study, organizational barriers identified include rigid disciplinary (lack of room for initiative), lack of evaluation systems, and the participation of public sector institutions in organization follow its CS policy published on its websites. It identified that the services cost of the pollution they produce, and it is an essential support for successful CS policy. The focus remained on minimizing policy where the organizations internalize the effective implementation of CS policy.

Third, a proactive approach to the CSR policy in the private sector is less likely to implement the environmental policies. This study emphasized the role of SME can obtain their services and can help in CS knowledge. The identified factors affecting the policy include unclear priorities.

# Results and discussion

The study intended to explore the relevant literature for understanding the corporate sustainability policymaking and implementation, different policy approaches, and the most important to identify the factors which affect the outcome of the CS policy and its implementation (see Table 6).

Through the literature review, it is learned that the pressing demand for corporate sustainability invites the academicians, researchers, and practitioners to practice the sustainability dimensions for a prosperous future and sustainable development. Thus, it is emphasized that practitioners should devise the CS policy and corporate policy as a single/combined policy.

After a thorough review of relevant articles, a total of five significant factors were identified which could influence the policymaking process (see Table 5). In these five factors, most of the scholars debated on the role of government/public sector institutions and stakeholders. Apart from these two, the organizational barriers have also appeared from the articles’ review as a significant factor (see Table 7). The elements in the organizational barrier need a focus to address the CS issues for better results.

Based on the literature reviewed, barriers and enablers are identified, which has further two types each, following is the detail of barriers and enablers.

Self-regulations/subsidiarity and normative references are also important factors identified. The importance of normative references cannot be overlooked for the organizations’ better quality products and services.

The facts which have come to the foreground after a thorough review show that at a different level of the public sector (macro and meso-institution), different stakeholder and different business models need to adopt an adequate policymaking approach among identified different policy approaches (see Table 4) for their success to achieve sustainable development for the better future of organizations.

# Evaluative study

# Concluding remarks

Fahey and Pralle (2016) argued that environmental policy research lacks in underdeveloped countries, and they call for more research in less wealthy countries around the world. Armstrong and Kamieniecki (2019) shed light on the importance of common sustainability challenges such as climate change. They emphasized the public sector pursuing sustainability problems in isolation and need to collaborate with the stakeholders for shared understanding and better policymaking.

With the overview of the literature, it is learned that policymakers of the organizations also need to strategize the

essential part of policy formulation. Once the stated factors and elements discussed above are considered in the entire process of policymaking, it will adequately address policy and practice gaps. Furthermore, it is also learned that, in many cases, states and governments’ intervention becomes imperative to make the policies successful and achieve desired results.

In the context of policymaking, it is identified that SMEs by their structure has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include informal ways of communications, less bureaucratic environment, speedy decision-making, direct interaction with customers and clients, and lean organizational structure. Simultaneously, disadvantages include lack of finances, lack of knowledge, and lack of expert human resource for sustainability issues. The disadvantages are like barriers and posing challenges for integrating the SME’s business activities with sustainability (Klewitz et al. 2012).

It is evident in the literature that the organization implements the environmental policy because of the reasons such as government laws and regulation, stakeholder’s pressure, competitor’s pressure, economic advantages (Bansal and Roth 2000; Mubarik 2015; Khan et al. 2020; Mubarik and Naghavi 2020; Alam et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2019). Another view to bridge the gaps between the policy and implementation needs a thorough translation of the policy into action plans, such as setting the objective, preparing the guidelines, and action plans (Epstein and Roy 2007) (see Figs. 2 and 3).

# Limitation

Since the CS is a broad concept, so as its policy and practice too. Thus, it is a challenging task to explore the entire body of knowledge. Hence, this review paper is limited to six (see Table 2) leading publishers with 10 keywords; more specifically, only CS policy and practice related significant paper were chosen for review.

# Implications

# Theoretical implication

In this review paper, stakeholder theory appeared as the most cited theory and institutional theory is the second most cited theory. It has come the foreground that institutional theory is embedded in the stakeholder theory or we can say that stakeholder theory encapsulate the isomorphic and defusion elements of institutional theory. This encapsulation will implicate the future research to expand and explore the further depth of stakeholder theory.

In this review paper specific factors and subfactors explored (see Fig. 3 and Table 7) which has impact on CS policy practices. These factors and subfactors will serve as base work for future quantitative research studies.

Furthermore, schematic snapshot developed on the basis of this review paper (see Fig. 2) depicts that how the global sustainability initiative creates trickle down impact from United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and penetrates in signatory countries macro and meso level policymaking institutions and subsequently encourages the companies operating in respective countries for practices of social and environmental dimensions. When the firms start practicing social and environmental initiatives, then the role of different management theories emerges according to the pressure of different stakeholders operating in the internal and external environment the companies.

The triple bottom line framework is operating in the management system, yet the volume of practices of social and environmental dimensions on the company basis, and in return its impact on society and environment is still vague. Researchers need to further investigate to devise methods so that utilization of financial capital and HR capital for CS practices may be quantitatively compared with the policy outcome of a company.

Keeping in view the essence of co-evolutionary theory, in this review paper, it has emerged that lack of knowledge of CS and policy making among stakeholders is hindering in obtaining the maximum advantage of limited resources and strengths of stakeholders. This essential implication of this review paper invites the policymakers to address it.

# Practical implication

This review paper will contribute as an authentic snapshot for future practitioners from two perspectives. First perspective is the eight different policy approaches being adopted by the policy makers (see Table 4). Each policy approach has its own significance and varies from sector to sector and business to business, and practitioners can formulate their organizational policy in the light of stated approaches. Second perspective is the factors affecting CS policy and practices (see Tables 5 and 6); the implications of these factors can contribute as a guidance tool in the process of policy making to avoid intermittent which causes the gaps in CS policy and practice.

# Recommendations

For future research, it is recommended to investigate the magnitude of factors and subfactors of CS Practices (see Fig. 3). It is also recommended to investigate the magnitude and direction of factors in Table 7 on CS practices. Furthermore, it is recommended to understand the effectivity of co-evolutionary theory in collaboration with the stakeholder theory.
