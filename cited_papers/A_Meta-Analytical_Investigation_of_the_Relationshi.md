In order to conclude that CSP has a positive effect on CFP it is necessary that the meta-analysis statistics establish a positive association between CSP and CFP. However, this is not sufficient. It is also necessary to investigate the existence of selection and specification effects.

The association between genuine and observed partial correlations can be expressed as:

r0 = f(rg, S, p, u)

where rg denotes the genuine partial correlation between CSP and financial performance, S is the systematic specification impact, p denotes publication bias, and u represents random specification differences.

The observed partial correlation r0 is not observed and must be inferred from the available literature. However, it is well known that study outcomes potentially distort the estimates of rg based on the population of published studies. Meta-regression analysis can be used to identify the impact of specification differences on the reported CSP-CFP relationships.

Publication bias involves the estimation of a less subjective approach to the analysis of meta-significance model (MST). Stanley (2001) recommends estimating the following regression:

Infti = &beta;0 + &alpha;ln(dfi) + &epsilon;

where ti and dfi denote the t-statistic and degrees of freedom from study i, respectively. The logic behind this test is simple. As sample size rises, the precision of the estimate rises also, and hence, t-statistics also rise. Stanley et al. (2004) show that the slope coefficient in equation (2) offers information on the existence of genuine empirical effects, publication bias, or both: If &alpha; < 0, there is a genuine association between CSP and CFP. If &alpha; > 0, the literature is contaminated by selection effects, or publication bias.

tion bias. If 0 < al <0.5, then there is a genuine association between CSP and CFP; as well as publication bias in the literature.

Our second concern is the existence and impact of specification bias. It is well known that study effects. Meta-analysis offers an excellent vehicle for detecting the impact of specification differences (Stanley 2001). In this paper we explore the impact of specification bias through the estimation of two meta-regression analysis models (MRA). The first MRA involves estimation of a general meta-regression model of the form:

SnKin + 01Bil + . + OmBim + u; Toi = 0 + YiXil + YkXik + 81Kil + . + (3)

The second MRA is an extension of the MST, combining specification differences with meta-significance analysis (known as MSTM-RA): This involves incorporating MRA with MST models, and hence, involves the estimation of a general MST model, that investigates the existence of a genuine union-profit effect, after controlling for specification and data differences:

In t = do + &1lndf; + 02Zi + &;

Equation 4 is basically an extension of Stanley (2001) to include MRA variables.
