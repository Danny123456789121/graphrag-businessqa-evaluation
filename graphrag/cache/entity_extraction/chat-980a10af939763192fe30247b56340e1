Generative AI can be used to detect fraudulent transactions in banking services. These models can identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data in real-time and proactively flag potential fraudulent transactions.\n\n# Marketing communication\n\nBanks can use generative AI to develop marketing communication campaigns that appeal to their target audience. As Mogaji et al. proposed, the possibilities of using AI to personalize emotionally appealing advertisements and the creative ability of generative AI to use images, text, and music could assist banks with the generation of personalized advertisements for their customers. Instead of having a generic marketing communication, banks can use generative AI to develop messages that align with the particular interest of their consumers. This would serve as opportunities for personalized messages based on the available data for the market segment. This personalized approach may include sending personalized birthday, religious, or cultural event greetings to their customers with unique images, text, and music based on their interests.\n\n# Streamlining business operations\n\nBanks can use generative AI to streamline their business operations, from mundane back-end activities to\n\n# 16 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\n\nconsumer-facing inquiries and interactions. As shown in Figure 3, contact center agents, advisors, and developers can engage with generative AI tools to take proactive steps to suggest personalized actions such as introducing a new savings account or proposing specific products to a customer. For example, A financial adviser can input customers’ transactions into a generative AI model to understand the consumers’ spending habits and offer a personalized service. Banks can use the generative AI model to create customer segments, understand their common interests and pain points, as well as determine the best way to engage with them. In addition, generative AI models can be used for training staff, streamlining repetitive and time-consuming tasks, serving as a virtual assistant to respond to customers’ increasingly complex inquiries as well as releasing staff from routine tasks to concentrate more on innovative and strategic responsibilities which would lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and accuracy.89\n\n# Challenges\n\n# The infrastructure\n\nIt is imperative to recognize that financial services are significantly regulated.90,91 The use of technology, access to data, and provision of financial services may serve as challenges. Even if regulatory demands are met, having the infrastructure to make generative AI or any form of digital technology in banking services work can also be challenging.91,92 While recognizing the efforts by Bloomberg, it is imperative to recognize that it was a domain-specific generative AI developed by a single company using their proprietary data. The challenge lies in exploring a working relationship between various banks for the possibility of sharing and combining data to develop a banking generative AI model. This collaboration will, however, present significant implications surrounding competition, data privacy, and ethics.81,82\n\n# Access to data\n\nWhile data is essential for training these generative AI models, access to quality data is critical and can also present a significant challenge. While the established, traditional, and old brands may have access to extensive proprietary data by virtue of their long years of operations and customer base, there are significant challenges for newer banks and fintech companies. While established banks like HSBC, Barclays, and Lloyds in the United Kingdom may use data they already have to develop their generative AI model, app-only banks like Starling and Monzo may have significant challenges in accessing huge quantities of data for their models. As such, they would have to depend on publicly available financial data which might not offer detailed information for consumers who wants to use the model. On the other hand, the provision of data for generative AI also presents a significant challenge, especially as Wall Street banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo are cracking down on AI-powered chatbot,93 there are concerns surrounding the effective and safe ways of using these technologies.\n\n# Accuracy of the results\n\nAs it is well known with generative AI tools, the generated insights may sometimes be wrong.9 They might produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts. This limitation has enormous implications for financial services providers, especially in cases where trust is very important. This inaccurate output will also have significant implications for consumers, staff, and other stakeholders who may rely on such output. As with the example of the customer using the generative AI model to look for financial advice, the assurance that the right financial advice has been provided is in question. Moreover, who takes the responsibility for providing those inaccurate and misleading advice? The bank that provided the AI model or the customer who did not use the correct prompt. As stated by Mogaji et al.,84 the implications of AI on the digital marketing of financial services to vulnerable customers, generative AI may not be suitable for offering financial decisions on loans and other forms of borrowings as it would be biased if they are trained on biased data.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n# The regulatory requirements\n\nBanks would need to reflect on the regulatory nature of their service provision and its impact on technology. As banks have been regulated with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and AI,91 it is imperative to recognize that generative AI will find its way into financial services providers. Regulators must be more responsive and proactive in providing advice and guidance on integrating generative AI into their business operations.89 Regulators and banks need to start discussing if and how they can work together to provide a regulatory framework for developing and using generative AI.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nBanks must reflect on their collaborative network to build these generative AI models. When working with\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Policymakers’ responsibilities\n\nIt is expected that the generative AI model will disrupt financial services. Thus, it is imperative to understand policymakers’ responsibility and preparedness for this disruption.
