The vector of controls includes a host of firm-specific variables known to predict returns, such as LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, MOM, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, BETA, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR. We also include year/month fixed effects. We cluster standard errors at the firm and year levels. Our coefficient of interest is.\n\nWe report the results in Table 8, Panel A. Column 1 shows the results for SCOPE 1; column 2 for SCOPE 2, and column 3 for SCOPE 3. For all three categories of emissions, we find a positive and statistically significant effect on firms’ stock returns. The effect is also economically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 1 leads to a 13-bps increase in stock returns, or 1.5% annualized, and a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 2 leads to a 23-bps increase in stock returns, or 2.8% annualized. Finally, a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 3 increases stock returns by 30 bps per month, or 3.6% annualized.\n\nSince emissions tend to cluster significantly within specific industries, a question of interest is whether the firm-specific differences can be attributed to industry-specific effects. To examine this possibility, we additionally include industry-fixed effects using the Trucost industry classification. The results presented in columns 4 to 6 are quite striking. Including industry effects significantly strengthens the cross-sectional dispersion of returns due to carbon emissions. In fact, the economic significance increases by anywhere between 70% and 280% relative to the model without industry effects.\n\nWe also plot the time series of the cumulative values of the unadjusted and industry-adjusted carbon premia in Fig. 4. Because different emission variables have different supports, we express the magnitudes in terms of unit standard deviation of each variable at each cross-section in time, so that all plots of the cumulative effect show comparable numbers in terms of economic significance. As can be seen in the figure, there are large positive cumulative returns for all measures of total emissions. The economic magnitudes of the effect become even larger once we factor in differences in industry exposures.\n\nWe next estimate the same cross-sectional regression model (1) replacing the level of emissions (LOG (Emissions TOT)) with the year-to-year growth in emissions (Δ(Emissions)). The results are reported in Table 8, Panel B. We find again a positive and statistically significant effect of the growth in emissions on stock returns. Interestingly, controlling for industry makes almost no difference when it comes to the effect of the growth in emissions. To allay any concern that our results may be driven by the correlation between emissions and size, we provide additional robustness tests in which we estimate univariate regression models with respective emission variables only, and regressions with emissions and size only. The results, reported in Table A.2 of the Online Appendix indicate that size is an important control when one considers the level of total emissions as a regressor but it is not as important in the model with the growth rate of emissions. Note also that ROE has a significant positive effect on stock returns under this specification (it is insignificant in the specification with emission levels). We attribute this to the fact that firms HHI, SALESGR, and EPSGR are measured as of time t to reflect the fact that all three may have a nontrivial contemporaneous effect on the level of emissions at time t.\n\nwith high emission growth likely also have higher earnings, which could result in higher stock returns (to the extent that the higher earnings outcome is unanticipated).\n\nWe also plot the time series of the cumulative values of the unadjusted and industry-adjusted carbon premia related to the growth in emissions in Fig. 5. All measures of emissions exhibit a steady rate of increase in the carbon premium over time.\n\nFinally, we estimate the cross-sectional regression model in (1) for emission intensities. We report the results in Table 8, Panel C. There is no significant effect of emission intensity on returns for any of the three categories of emissions, whether we control for industry or not. The cumulative effect of emission intensity on the carbon premium, presented in Fig. 6, is also quite weak, with the exception of scope 2 for which we observe a slightly positive trend. Overall, these results reveal that there is a significant carbon premium with respect to the level of emissions, reflecting firms’ long-run risk exposure to carbon emissions, and a premium with respect to the growth in emissions, which capture the more short-term evolution of firms’ risk exposure to future emissions.\n\nOne open question with our analysis above is that we use carbon emission data in year t to explain monthly returns over the same year t. This could conceivably introduce a look-ahead bias. That is, under this specification we might unwittingly relate stock returns for some months in year t to emission data that might not yet have been available to investors. To address this question, we undertake the following robustness check. We relate monthly stock returns with a lag of respectively 0 to 12 months between the time when emissions are reported and the month when returns are realized.\n\nAnother interpretation of the results with lagged returns is that investors have limited attention and do not immediately absorb new information about carbon emissions at the firm level (Kacperczyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp, 2016). In that case, carbon emissions for year t will be gradually reflected in returns over the year. An additional consideration is that investors obtain information about carbon emissions from multiple sources that are not all\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
