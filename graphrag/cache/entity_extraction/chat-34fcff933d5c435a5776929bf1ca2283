This result is consistent with D.Sundarasen et al. (2016). In addition, the chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 3.75) indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error.\n\n# 4.8 Diversity of Ownership\n\n# 4.8.1 Government Ownership\n\nTable 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1724, 95% confidence interval -- 0.0920; 0.4368) between government ownership and CSD using 1332 sample sizes of 8 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with other studies (Ahmed Haji, 2013, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014, Naser et al., 2006, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.\n\n# 4.8.2 Foreign Ownership\n\nThe meta-analysis results of Table 3 shows an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1735, 95% confidence interval -0.0439; 0.3909) between foreign ownership and CSD using 326 sample sizes of 4 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with Sufian and Zahan (2013). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.\n\n# 4.8.3 Institutional Ownership\n\nThe general meta-analysis results of Table 3 presents an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0261, 95% confidence interval -0.0472; 0.0994) between institutional ownership and CSD using 993 sample sizes of 5 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with Li and Zhang (2010) and (Nurhayati et al., 2016). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.\n\n# 4.8.4 Managerial Ownership\n\nThe overall meta-analysis results for the managerial ownership of Table 3 show a mean correlation (𝑟) of -0.1289 with the 95% confidence interval between -0.1289 and -0.1289 indicates a significant negative association with CSD. Similar findings find by Razak and Mustapha (2013), Rashid and Lodh (2008), and Mohd Ghazali (2007). The chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 4.89) of Table 3 indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 100% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problem, no further analysis needed.\n\n# 4.8.5 Concentrated Ownership\n\nThe general meta-analysis results of Table 3 identifies a significant negative association (𝑟 = -0.022, 95% confidence interval -0.022; -0.022) between concentrated ownership and CSD using 1165 sample sizes of 7 studies. The result is consistent with Lu and Abeysekera (2014). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.\n\n# 5. Concluding Remarks and Future Research Directions\n\nThe study investigates the impacts of corporate governance (CG) variables on the corporate social disclosures (CSD). Prior studies used meta-analysis technique to determine the determinants of CSD but in different ways. Also, this is the first meta-analytical review on the relationship between CG and CSD. Hence, the study incorporates the result of 29 previous studies on the link between CG and CSD. In the present paper, we include 12 explanatory variables of corporate governance such as board independence, board Size, board gender diversity, the frequency of board meetings, the composition of non-executive directors, CEO duality, auditors’ credibility, government ownership, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership, and concentrated ownership.\n\nThe results of the comprehensive meta-analysis found that board Size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility are significantly and positively associated with CSD. Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership are insignificantly and positively associated with CSD. CEO duality also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study also uses the sub-grouping analysis based on country differences. The findings indicate that only the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study. The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.\n\nAlthough this study is the first meta-analytical review for examining the impact of CG on CSD, the study faces limitations as well. It excludes the various corporate characteristics as determinants of CSD. Therefore, further study should investigate by considering all of the variables besides CG like firm size, leverage, profitability, firm age\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
