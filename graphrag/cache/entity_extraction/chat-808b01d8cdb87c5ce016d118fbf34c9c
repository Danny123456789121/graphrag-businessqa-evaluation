Several explanations for the apparent inconsistency have been proposed, involving both methodological and theoretical issues (Ruf, Muralidhar, Brown, Janney, & Paul, 2001). These explanations address different aspects, describing (1) the lack of a sound theoretical foundation (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Ullmann, 1985); (2) the lack of a clear idea of the direction of causality (e.g., Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; Surroca, Tribó, & Waddock, 2010; Waddock & Graves, 1997); (3) the inconsistency of deﬁning and measuring the constructs of interest (e.g., Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Grifﬁn & Mahon, 1997; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006); and (4) the use of misspeciﬁed models due to omitted variables and a lack of consideration of moderating or mediating inﬂuences (e.g., Russo & Minto, 2012; Telle, 2006).\n\n# Prior reviews and meta-analyses: Rationale for the present study\n\nInconclusive ﬁndings in a given ﬁeld of inquiry (as it is the case for the CEP-CFP nexus) constitute great nuisances to researchers by limiting the understanding of certain phenomena and impeding credible scientiﬁc generalizations (e.g., Rousseau, 2006). Thus, it is not surprising that several attempts have been made to consolidate the empirical research on the relationship between CEP and CFP. In order to clarify the distinct contribution of our study, we brieﬂy review these prior works and explain why they merely allow limited conclusions regarding the focal relationship.\n\n# Narrative reviews, vote counts and the superiority of meta-analysis\n\nThe vast majority of existing reviews on the relationship between CEP and CFP either used narrative approaches or applied vote count procedures. Narrative reviews, provided for example by Ambec and Lanoie (2008), Blanco, Rey-Maquieira, and Lozano (2009), Guenther and Hoppe (2014), Molina-Azorín et al. (2009), and Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, and Steger (2005), summarize the available research in a descriptive manner without providing a quantitative integration. These reviews without any doubt have contributed to the integration of the vast amount of CEP–CFP studies. However, without calling into question the general appropriateness of narrative reviews, at least in cases where multiple studies have yielded inconclusive results, narrative approaches are subject to several limitations (e.g., purely descriptive nature, subjectivity, and lacking critical assessment) and thus hardly enable conclusions that make sense of conﬂicting empirical ﬁndings (e.g., Hart, 1998; Tranﬁeld, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). Another approach that has been applied for synthesizing the body of empirical CEP–CFP studies refers to the vote count technique (e.g., Guenther, Hoppe, & Endrikat, 2011; Horváthová, 2010; Margolis & Walsh, 2001). In vote counts study ﬁndings are simply coded and aggregated as positive, negative, or non-signiﬁcant (Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003). This approach has been strongly criticized by many management scholars and statistical experts due to several substantial problems (e.g., Type II error problems, ignoring of sample size differences, or lacking provision of a point estimate of effect sizes), which likely lead to invalid conclusions (Combs et al. 2011; Dalton & Dalton 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). In contrast to narrative reviews or vote counts meta-analytic methodology, which is based on accurate statistical aggregation, is the most sophisticated research-integration technique providing a sound way to quantitatively accumulate empirical ﬁndings, to make sense of inconclusive empirical evidence, and to draw conclusions that reconcile conﬂicting results (e.g., Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, Pierce, & Dalton, 2011; Combs et al., 2011; Geyskens, Krishnan, Steenkamp, & Cunha, 2009; Orlitzky et al. 2003).\n\n# Previous meta-analyses\n\nOrlitzky et al.’s (2003) prominent meta-analysis explored the more general relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP. Their study sample covered the years from 1972 to 1997 and only included US studies. By breaking down the entire sample of studies in different subgroups they examined, among other points, the relationship between CEP and CFP (139 effect sizes). Allouche and Laroche (2005) provided another meta-analysis including 82 studies concerned with the relationship between CSP and CFP. They also partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis (84 effect sizes).\n\nThere are several reasons why the existing CSP–CFP meta-analyses hardly allow drawing deﬁnitive conclusions with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP. First, the number of CEP–CFP studies included in these analyses is far from exhaustive. That applies in particular to the inﬂuential study of Orlitzky et al. (2003), which\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
