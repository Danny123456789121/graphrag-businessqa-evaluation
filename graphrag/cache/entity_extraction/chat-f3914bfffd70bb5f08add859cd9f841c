Once it has been agreed upon that all members of society are responsible for creating such a sustainable form of development, companies are also expected to act responsibly. All corporate activities have an influence on society and the natural environment and, therefore, may (or may not) contribute to sustainable development.\n\nHow can companies create societal value while contributing to sustainable development? To answer this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the\n\n1 Societal value refers to both society and nature.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nimpacts of business on societies and the natural environment. These impacts then need to be integrated into the content dimension of strategy. One must clarify how sustainable strategic management can reduce negative social and environmental impacts and contribute to improving social and environmental outcomes.\n\nA company is a system that transforms resources (i.e., inputs) into saleable products and services as well as into unwanted by-products, waste and emissions (Hinterhuber, 2004). In order to do so, the company must deliver appropriate returns to those who provide the company with resources (see Figure 1). Management coordinates internal activities as well as its relationships with customers, shareholders, suppliers, partner companies, authorities, society and the stakeholders in general.\n\nShareholders and financial community\n\ncompany\n\n|Suppliers|Development; Production, Sales|Employees|\n|---|---|---|\n|Technoloqv and infrastructure|Materials and energy|devices|\n|Resource inputs|Society|MANUS CRIP TcompaniesPartner|\n|Appropriate returns|Appropriate returns|Appropriate returns|\n\nFigure 1: A company as a system for transforming resources (Hinterhuber, 2004)\n\nSustainability issues can be divided into economic (see Table 1), environmental (see Table 2) and social issues (see Table 3), and are related to all input and output flows. With regard to management methods and instruments, companies can implement and run environmental (e.g., ISO 14001; EMAS) or social (e.g., SA 8000) management systems, integrated management systems (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005; Jørgensen et al., 2006), or use specific management instruments to address environmental or social issues (such as LCA or social LCA, sustainability balanced scorecards (Figge et al., 2002), or environmental cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000)).\n\nEconomic sustainability embraces several general aspects of an organization that need to be respected, in addition to environmental and social aspects, in order to maintain the competitiveness of the company (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Financial stability and liquidity, profitability and financial benefits that are the result of sustainability activities are primary elements making up the economic dimension (Labuschagne et al., 2005). Therefore, issues such as\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\ninnovation and technology management, collaboration, knowledge management, organizational processes and purchase or sustainability reporting are important economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010).\n\n# Table 1: Economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010)\n\n|Innovation and Technology|Effort made in sustainability-related R&D to reduce the environmental impacts of new products and business activities.
