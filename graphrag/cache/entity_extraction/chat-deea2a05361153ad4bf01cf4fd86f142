Hart (1995) complements that strategy and competitive advantages are strongly influenced by the environmental performance of a firm, whereas pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development are the core drivers. Following Davis (1973), environmental responsibility consequently leads to a long‐term profit maximization followed by a better community and society.\n\nThe NRBV is supported by the instrumental stakeholder theory (Davis, 1973; Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Jones, 1995; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003). Thus, each firm is surrounded by a network of expectations from contractual relationships, for example, from suppliers, employees, or customers. Managing these stakeholder interests leads to increasing profitability, stability, and growth (Damak‐Ayadi & Pesqueux, 2005). As Jones (1995) points out, trusting and cooperative behavior solve problems related to opportunistic behavior. Because environmental engagement can be seen as an effort to meet these stakeholder expectations, a firm has to meet these requirements to achieve financial advantages, although such behavior may seem to be economically irrational or altruistic (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Jones, 1995). For example, economic advantages might be greater.\n\nFIGURE 1 Typology of theoretical CEP–CFP relations. CEP: corporate environmental performance; CFP: corporate financial performance\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\ncustomer loyalty, long‐term supply relationships, better reputation, product differentiation, and higher selling prices. We hypothesize that this effect might especially hold in the long term.\n\nIn this context, literature often refers to the social impact hypothesis coined by Latané (1981). Accordingly, a firm must not only meet explicit expectations of stakeholders as shown above but also implicit expectations such as quality service or environmental responsibility (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987). If such expectations are not fulfilled, fears and risk on the market increase and such firms may be faced with additional and more costly explicit agreements in the future, for example, as parties such as the government pass more stringent rules to ensure more environmentally conscious behavior. Because changes in the trust and contractual conditions of stakeholders are not assumed to arise in the short term, we expect these negative effects to occur in the medium to long run. On the contrary, environmentally conscious firms have more low‐cost implicit claims, resulting in a higher financial performance (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988). Hence, environmental consciousness is a means to retain freedom in decision making (Davis, 1973).\n\n# 2.2 CFP affects CEP\n\nFor the second causal sequence, literature provides the managerial opportunism hypothesis, which suggests a negative impact of CFP on CEP (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997). This position is grounded on the assumption that managers follow their own targets, which may not be in the best interest of the shareholders (Alkhafaji, 1989; Posner & Schmidt, 1992; Weidenbaum & Vogt, 1987). This circumstance directly leads to inefficiencies in the operating firm, which may result from wages linked to short‐term profits and stock prices (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997; Weidenbaum & Vogt, 1987). Thus, especially when a firm performs well, managers tend to increase their own income by reducing environmental investments, which we expect to affect CEP in the long run. Apart from that, managers may expand corporate environmental expenditures to compensate bad corporate performance (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997). These effects might especially occur in the short term, if a firm suffers unexpected bad business results. This managerial behavior is especially driven by a firm's compensation system. According to Preston and O'Bannon (1997), opportunistic activities are reinforced if manager salaries are linked to short‐term profits of a firm and the improvement of environmental performance is postponed for the benefit of private bonus payments. One potential solution might be the linkage of executive compensation to corporate environmental performance (Cordeiro & Sarkis, 2008).\n\nRepresentatives of the slack resources theory suggest a positive impact of CFP on CEP. Hence, slack resources generated from good financial performance enable companies to invest in environmental programs (Kraft & Hage, 1990). Analogous to the NRBV, investing in environmental activities is connected with enhancing internal resources, new capabilities, and comparative advantages of the firm, as well as possibilities for differentiation through innovative and eco‐friendly developments (Bourgeois, 1981). Thus, investing slack resources also allows firms to adapt to their external environment for long‐term profitability. Although firms often want to act environmentally friendly and socially, they might be restricted by limited availability of financial resources (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997). If financial slack is only available in 1 year, there might be too little time to develop proactive environmental strategies and a firm instead invests in ecological one‐off actions.\n\n# 2.3 Bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP\n\nWaddock and Graves (1997) reconciled the two previously explained causal relations, proposing the “virtuous circle”—a concurrent relationship between CEP and CFP (Waddock & Graves, 1997). Following this hypothesis, superior CEP initiates better CFP, which again allows companies to reinvest in CEP. This leads to a two‐way causality for the two constructs. The process might either begin with available financial slack or with an initial investment in environmental performance. This mutually supportive process might, however, also arise as a negative synergy (Allouche & Laroche, 2005).\n\n# 3 EMPIRICAL ANAL\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
