More directly, Goldreyer and Diltz (1999) and Statman and Glushkov (2009) show that a positive screening has a\n\nÂ© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nPositive impact on portfolio performance, but a negative screening has a negative impact.\n\n# 5.2.7. Mutual funds.\n\nPerformance of mutual funds is subject to various factors such as transaction costs, fees and expenditures, and managerial compensation that are largely ignored in analyses on portfolios composed by researchers. In addition, it is well known that managed mutual funds do not perform better than the market as a whole (Jensen, 1968; Carhart, 1997). Therefore, ESs on SRI mutual funds will be smaller than ESs on SRI portfolios formed by researchers. A significantly negative sign for the coefficient of mutual fund moderator in Table 8 is supportive of these arguments and is consistent with Hypothesis 8.\n\n# 5.3. Results on Methodological Issues\n\nIn this section, we report the impact that empirical methodologies used by author(s) may have on the AES. Table 10 (Table 11) contains the results of univariate (multivariate) regressions.\n\n# 5.3.1. Variable adjustments.\n\nTo begin with, the coefficient of the risk adjustment dummy is statistically significant with a negative sign. This is consistent with Hypothesis 9-1, indicating that the AESs calculated from risk-adjusted performance measures are systematically smaller than those calculated from raw returns. Table 12 reports the risk-adjusted performance measures used in the sample. The majority of papers use Jensenâs alpha, and only a small number of papers use the Sharpe ratio or the Treynor index (MâZali and Turcotte, 1998). Other measures are mostly based on accounting data such as return on assets and the average ES is very large (Cohen et al., 1997). Basically, stock returns are forward looking, but accounting data are not, and it is not uncommon to have conflicting results in finance research. Moreover, the small sample size of other measures makes it difficult to draw any serious inference.\n\nSince SRI funds have a different exposure from conventional funds to small firms, equally weighted portfolio returns can generate undeserved performance differences between the two, unlike value-weighted returns. In Tables 10 and 11, the coefficient of weighting scheme has a negative sign and is statistically significant, indicating that the value weighting scheme tends to have smaller AESs, as predicted by Hypothesis 9-2.\n\nHypothesis 9-3 suggests that using more accurate data can reduce the possibility of obtaining a spurious difference between SRI and conventional investments. For example, if SRI funds invest more in small firms than conventional funds, ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in SRI and conventional portfolio performance. Therefore, papers improving data accuracy by considering dividends and stock splits when calculating returns will have smaller AESs. The significantly negative sign of data accuracy variable in model (2) of Table 11 is consistent with Hypothesis 9-3 although other regressions do not show statistical significance.\n\nÂ© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n25\n\n# C.-S.
