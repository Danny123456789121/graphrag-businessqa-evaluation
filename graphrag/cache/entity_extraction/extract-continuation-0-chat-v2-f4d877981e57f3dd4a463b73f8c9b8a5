Hence, also with regard to the CEPâ€“CFP link risk may play an important role. CEP may well provide some type of insurance effect (Minor & Morgan, 2011; Peloza, 2006) as it may reduce the probability of litigation, increase firm reputation, and may lead to tax benefits, lower costs of equity capital and lower costs of debt (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Sharfman & Fernando, 2008). In terms of the reverse causal direction lower risk may allow better evaluations of prospective CFP and thus provides certainty with regard to the financial planning of environmental activities (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). With regard to our (non)findings concerning the other control variables, it seems possible that variables such as firm size or capital intensity may be too broad proxies and that other contingent variables which so far have not been taken into account determine the focal relationship. For example, Delmas et al. (2011) showed that absorptive capacity may leverage cost advantages from environmental strategies. Furthermore, Surroca et al. (2010) provided evidence for mediating effects of human capital and organizational culture.\n\nIn addition, the partial HOMA revealed moderation effects with regard to the control for endogeneity and the type of sample. In view of the fact that study findings vary systematically with regard to whether the problem of endogeneity has been addressed or not, the partial HOMA provided additional support for the suggestion of bidirectional causal linkages between CEP and CFP. Furthermore, as our findings indicated that studies relying on single industry samples yield significantly stronger results than studies using cross-sectional samples, it reinforces the skepticism towards the appropriateness of cross-sectional designs for examining the CEPâ€“CFP link, which has been raised by several scholars (e.g., Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wokutch & Spencer, 1987).\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al.

On the other hand, firms with lower levels of risk have greater financial security, which may positively influence the decision for investments in CEP (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Finally, an issue that has not been addressed by our study refers to the potential influence of country-level factors such as different regulatory systems or different cultural values. Thus, examining whether the relationship between CEP and CFP varies across different institutional settings might be an interesting area for future research.\n\n# Limitations and future research\n\nAlthough we sought to provide the best possible evidence on the CEPâ€“CFP link in both accuracy and comprehensiveness, our meta-analysis is not free from limitations. Like any meta-analysis our study is constrained by the nature and scope of the primary studies it draws on (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). As outlined earlier, many of the studies on the relationship between CEP and CFP are subject to methodological flaws such as poor measurement of the constructs of interests, omitted variables, inadequate sampling procedures, and so on. We tried to account for these issues by distinguishing between different measurement approaches for both focal constructs, by examining different sets of temporal associations, and by examining methodological artifacts in our partial HOMA (i.e., the use of control variables, the consideration of potential endogeneity, the type of samples used). In doing so, we tried to shed light on potential reasons for the inconclusiveness of the empirical findings yielded so far. Nevertheless, we have to admit that there are further issues we were not able to address by means of our analysis.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMotivation and starting point of our analysis was the inconsistency in the empirical findings on the relationship between CEP and CFP. By conducting a meta-analysis based on 245 bivariate correlations and 208 partial correlations derived from a total of 149 studies, we addressed the lack of consensus and provided evidence for an overall positive relationship between CEP and CFP. By considering the multidimensionality of both constructs and by focusing on the direction of causality, our analysis centered around two highly material issues pertaining to the focal relationship.\n\nAs pointed out, both constructs of interest are of multidimensional nature. While our analysis accounted for this issue by differentiating between outcome-based and process-based CEP and market-based and accounting-based CFP respectively, a more fine-grained breakdown was prevented by the number of available effect sizes. Along with differences pertaining to corporate activities (e.g., industry-level differences or differences due to varying levels of vertical integration), environmental impacts may differ substantially across firms making them highly context-specific (Goldstein, Hilliard, & Parker, 2011). Therefore, a more sophisticated differentiation of the CEP construct may yield important insights. Furthermore, the varying findings with regard to process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP call for further research. Similarly, the somewhat counterintuitive finding of a stronger relationship for accounting-based measures of CFP for studies measuring both constructs concurrently clearly warrants further investigations. Is the relationship indeed mainly driven by mechanisms internal to the firm rather than by external aspects? Furthermore, our analysis of potential moderation effects regarding the influence of control variables was limited to variables that had been employed in a sufficiently large number allowing subgroup comparisons.
