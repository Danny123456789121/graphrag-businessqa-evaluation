The moderator analysis will be discussed after the main effect results are presented.\n\n# Moderator Results (Full Sample)\n\nIn addition to integrating the results across studies, meta-analytic procedures can help find factors that moderate the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. In this section, the whole dataset is split into several pairs of subsets. Then the generalized least squares (GLS) analysis for the moderator effects was performed. Before running GLS, outliers were examined by calculating Huffcutt and Arthur’s (1995) sample-adjusted meta-analytic deviancy (SAMD) statistic. The final dataset for moderator analysis includes 198 effect sizes. Table 3 presents an overview of the GLS results. The results show that in addition to the positive correlation observed in prior research between sustainability performance and financial performance, other moderators also contribute to the CSP-CFP relationship. These moderator variables are listed in Table 3.\n\nAs shown in Table 3, variable measurement issues (for example, environmental versus social issues; accounting-based versus market-based; the short-term versus long-term impact of sustainability engagement), samples used (for example, multi-industry versus single industry; U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms), as well as statistical methodologies employed (simple versus complex) have important moderating effects on the link between sustainability performance and financial performance. A simple method refers to a correlation coefficient, regression, or survey method; and a complex method refers to a two-stage least squares or three-stage least squares regression method employed in the examined studies. To further understand the nature (including the magnitude and direction) of the moderator effects, a univariate analysis was conducted on each moderator that was found to be significant in the GLS analysis. The procedure for univariate analysis is similar to the overall analysis except that no test is needed for the fail-safe (NfsR). The overall results are reported in Table 4.\n\nDepending on the nature of the impact, the results were reported from post hoc analyses in three categories: measurement-related moderator effect, sample-related moderator effect, and methodology-related moderator effect. In the next section, results of the GLS analyses for each moderator examined were reported, as well as significant findings from the post hoc univariate analyses.\n\n# Measurement-Related Moderators of Corporate Sustainability Performance Effects on Corporate Financial Performance\n\nIn the dataset, different measures of the dependent variable (financial performance) and independent variable (sustainability performance) play significant moderating effects on the financial-sustainability relationship. For sustainability performance measures, results in Table 3 indicate that studies where the sustainability issue is related to the environment are significantly different from those studies where the examined studies are related to social issues (b = -2.5451, p &lt; 0.01). Post hoc analyses in Table 4 reveal that the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance is significantly greater when the examined issue is environmental-related (r = 0.2035, p &lt; 0.01) than where the issue is social related (r = ...\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Lu and Taylor\n\n# TABLE 3\n\n# Moderator Results for Corporate Sustainability Performance Correlations\n\n|Factor|Corporate Financial Performance|\n|---|---|\n|Nature of variable measurements| |\n|Environmental versus social|2.5451*|\n|Accounting-based versus market-based|5.5254*|\n|Short-term versus long-term|13.9943*|\n|Nature of the sample| |\n|Post-2000 versus pre-2000|19.0246*|\n|Multi-industry versus single industry|9.7899*|\n|U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms|2.8029*|\n|Method of analysis| |\n|Complex versus simple|16.5990*|\n|Number of observations|198|\n\n* p < 0.01. The correlations reported above are weighted by sample size.\n\n# Variable Definitions:\n\n- Corporate Sustainability Performance (CSP) = 1 if environmental issues and 0 if social issues are addressed in the article;\n- Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) = 1 if financial performance (CFP) is measured using accounting numbers or ratios, and 0 if market-based measures;\n- Long-Term Effect = 1 if short-term, and 0 if long-term effect of corporate sustainability performance on corporate financial performance is examined in an individual study;\n- Sample Period = 1 if sample period studied is after year 2000 (post-2000), and 0 if before 2000 (pre-2000);\n- Industry = 1 if sample firms are from multiple industries, and 0 if from a single industry;\n- Country = 1 if sample firms are U.S. firms, and 0 if non-U.S. firms;\n- Methodology = 1 if a complex method (such as two-stage least squares or three-stage least squares regression method) is used, and 0 if a simple method (such as correlation coefficient, regression, or survey method) is used in the prior studies.\n\nFor financial performance measures, results in Table 3 indicate that sustainability performance effects vary significantly depending on whether the financial performance is using an accounting-based measure or market-based measure (b = 5.5254, p < 0.01). Studies that use accounting-based measures (for example, accounting ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, or return on sales) to proxy for financial performance find a stronger positive impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than studies that use market-based measures (for example, stock price or market return).
