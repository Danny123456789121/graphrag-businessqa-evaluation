In other words, a rigorous examination of the application of AI in L&SCM demands a multi- or mixed-method research approach. Below, we outline a few quantitative and qualitative methods suitable for conducting rigorous research in this domain.\n\nBeginning with the experimental research method, it stands as a pivotal tool in evaluating the effectiveness of AI applications within a controlled environment. Researchers have the latitude to create AI system prototypes and subject them to diverse simulated conditions to gauge their performance. This could encompass tasks such as leveraging AI for demand forecasting—with generative models trained to anticipate future demand trends based on past data—or utilizing AI for route optimization to devise the most time and cost-efficient transportation routes. Furthermore, experiential research may facilitate a detailed comparison of the efficiency and efficacy of AI tools against outputs derived from traditional methods, including manual approaches. Survey-based theory testing can be employed to delve into issues surrounding the adoption and utilization of AI, especially at an individual level. In addition, methodologies such as regression analysis and time-series forecasting can be applied to scrutinize extensive datasets and further the development of predictive models. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be leveraged to empower AI systems to autonomously formulate solutions based on data analysis.\n\nQualitative research can complement quantitative methods, allowing for a deeper understanding through interviews and focus groups involving industry stakeholders. This method is instrumental in exploring the practical challenges and opportunities of implementing AI in logistics and supply chain management, thus guiding the AI systems to align with end-user requirements and preferences. The case study method offers a fertile ground for understanding individual or comparative scenarios, providing a rich narrative of AI deployment in various logistical contexts. For instance, case studies might explore the enhancements AI can bring to warehouse management through optimal storage and retrieval strategies. The approach is equally potent in examining the usage and impact of AI at both organizational and team levels. Additionally, grounded theory methodology can be utilized to build theories closely tied to the data accumulated during research, supporting the creation of AI systems grounded in empirical evidence.\n\nAction research can be employed as an iterative method, promoting a cycle of planning, action, observation, and reflection, thereby aiding the development of adaptive and optimized AI systems. This approach welcomes real-time adjustments to AI systems, reflecting feedback acquired during the testing phases. Similar outcomes can be achieved through Action Design Research. By harnessing a blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods, researchers can forge a substantial understanding of the potential and constraints of AI in L&SCM, guiding the way to innovative and pragmatic solutions in this arena. The essential research questions that are relevant to methodologies for examining the impact of AI in L&SCM are outlined below:\n\n- What are the appropriate research designs and methods to investigate the impact of AI at micro, macro, and meso levels in L&SCM?\n- What methodologies can be applied to study the potential biases and inequalities introduced by the integration of AI in L&SCM?\n- What are the appropriate metrics and evaluation techniques to measure the impact of AI on supply chain efficiency and productivity?\n- How can mixed methods be used to understand the human experience and perspectives on the increasing role of AI in logistics?\n- How do existing and new research methodologies assist in identifying and understanding potential innovations in L&SCM through the lens of AI development?\n\n# EDITORIAL\n\n# CONCLUSION AND PAPERS IN THIS ISSUE\n\nJBL has a long history of supporting research connected to and advancing the practice of L&SCM. While this generative AI discussion opens the door to an ongoing call for related research in L&SCM, this journal always supports technology-oriented research. The first three papers in this issue continue our 45-year tradition of examining emerging tech-based topics like Blockchain, e-fulfillment systems, and Industry 4.0 trends.\n\nIn “Exploring Blockchain for Disaster Prevention and Relief: A Comprehensive Framework Based on Industry Case Studies,” Treiblmaier and Rejeb employ a group of case studies to investigate how Blockchain solutions can be implemented in disaster prevention and relief scenarios. Examining the roles of key stakeholders, the authors illustrate firm motivations in deploying blockchain technology, listing the relevant properties and highlighting contingency factors. Findings demonstrate blockchain opportunities for streamlining information flows and augmenting stakeholder capabilities. Using L&SCM technology to save lives is a priority for our research. Expect to see growing attention to humanitarian logistics in JBL soon!\n\nIn the second paper, “Modularization of the Front-End Logistics Services in e-Fulfillment,” Yurt et al. (2023) explore the context of service modularity in customer-facing logistics for e-fulfillment. We were happy to receive this paper as we continue to call for more consumer logistics work. Expect a special topic forum in early 2024. These authors used an online survey of customers to extract data and identify clusters (multichannel shoppers, infrequent shoppers, and online fans), providing preliminary evidence on how commonality and variability aspects of service modularity optimize the number of service options and related performance levels.\n\nPessot et al. (2023) move up to the industry level by “Empowering supply chains with Industry 4.0 technologies to face megatrends.” They leverage focus group interviews to investigate how megatrends impact the supply chain landscape and the role of technology in supporting supply chain alignment. Five supply chain capabilities are identified as prevalent and fitting external contingencies. The study also highlights and compares the potential of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI refers to artificial intelligence, a technology that has the potential to impact various sectors, including logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L&SCM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>L&SCM stands for logistics and supply chain management, a sector that is increasingly integrating AI technologies to enhance efficiency and productivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JBL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JBL is a journal that supports research related to logistics and supply chain management, focusing on technology-oriented topics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOCKCHAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blockchain is a technology that can be utilized in logistics for disaster prevention and relief, streamlining information flows and enhancing stakeholder capabilities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDUSTRY 4.0<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Industry 4.0 refers to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, impacting supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREIBLMAIER AND REJEB<|>PERSON<|>Treiblmaier and Rejeb are authors who conducted research on the implementation of blockchain solutions in disaster scenarios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YURT ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Yurt et al. are authors who explored service modularity in customer-facing logistics for e-fulfillment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PESSOT ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Pessot et al. are authors who investigated the impact of megatrends on supply chains and the role of technology in alignment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI<|>L&SCM<|>AI technologies are being integrated into logistics and supply chain management to enhance efficiency and productivity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JBL<|>AI<|>JBL supports research related to AI's impact on logistics and supply chain management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOCKCHAIN<|>L&SCM<|>Blockchain technology can be applied in logistics and supply chain management for disaster prevention and relief<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDUSTRY 4.0<|>L&SCM<|>Industry 4.0 technologies are influencing logistics and supply chain management practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREIBLMAIER AND REJEB<|>BLOCKCHAIN<|>Treiblmaier and Rejeb conducted research on blockchain solutions in logistics<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YURT ET AL.<|>L&SCM<|>Yurt et al. explored logistics services in the context of e-fulfillment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PESSOT ET AL.<|>L&SCM<|>Pessot et al. investigated how megatrends affect supply chain capabilities<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
