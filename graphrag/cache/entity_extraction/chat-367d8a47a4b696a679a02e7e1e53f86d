Endogeneity occurs in cases where the independent variable in a regression model is correlated with the error term, or due to simultaneous causality between the dependent and the independent variable (Sánchez-Ballesta & García-Meca, 2007; van Essen et al., in press). As outlined earlier, the relationship between CEP and CFP may involve bidirectional causality. Therefore, the fact of controlling or not controlling for endogeneity can be conceived as a kind of methodological artifact, which may have a moderation effect on the study findings.\n\nAnother study artifact likely to affect the findings regarding the CEP–CFP relationship refers to the type of sample underlying the empirical examinations. Previous studies have drawn on both single industry samples and cross-sectional samples. As already outlined, industries differ with regard to several issues that may determine the focal relationship. Thus, multiple industry samples may mask differences due to specific industry contexts (Griffin & Mahon, 1997). Consequently, several scholars pointed out, that research on the CEP–CFP link should be conducted within specific industries (e.g., Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Moore, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wokutch & Spencer, 1987).\n\nAs knowledge about social phenomena is historically dependent, relationships between constructs may vary over time (Combs et al., 2011; Gergen, 1976). In view of the continuously increasing relevance of environmental issues this may particularly apply to the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, study findings are determined by the underlying research design, which might have improved over time (Combs et al., 2011). Again, this may apply to the empirical research concerned with the focal relationship as earlier studies are subject to several methodological shortcomings (e.g., Russo & Fouts, 1997; Wood & Jones, 1995). Consequently, the timing of research may represent an artifact entailing potential moderation effects.\n\nWe argue that the outlined methodological artifacts may constitute important explanations for the inconsistency of empirical findings. However, as we have rather limited theoretical rationale for the effects of these artifacts, we do not offer hypotheses in this regard. This exploratory approach is in line with previous meta-analytic studies (e.g., Crook, Ketchen, Combs, & Todd, 2008; Geykens, Steenkamp, & Kumar, 2006; Kirca, Hult, Deligonul, Perryy, & Cavusgil, 2012).\n\n# Methodology\n\n# Literature search and inclusion criteria\n\nTo ensure that our study sample was as comprehensive as possible, we used three complementary search strategies. First, we conducted a systematic search in the following databases: Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, E-Journals, Elsevier Science Direct, Environment Complete, and GreenFILE.11\n\nSecond, we manually searched the reference lists of prior reviews and the studies we identified in step one (i.e., we employed an “ancestry” approach) (Aguinis et al., 2011). Third, we searched the SSRN database to locate additional unpublished manuscripts. After a first scan, in which non-empirical papers and case studies were excluded, our initial sample comprised 432 studies. We then filtered this sample against a set of several inclusion/exclusion criteria. First, to be included, a study was required to provide an empirical examination of the relationship between CEP and CFP.12 Second, we excluded studies that focused on the relationship between environmental disclosure and CFP. While several studies, mostly earlier works, used disclosure measures as proxies for CEP, more recent works have suggested that environmental disclosure does not necessarily represent CEP; it may even be negatively related to it (e.g., Hughes et al., 2001; Patten, 2002). Fourth, we excluded event studies due to their fundamentally different methodology. Finally, to be included in our sample studies had to report sample sizes and bivariate correlations or outcome statistics convertible to those (e.g., Bausch & Pils, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003). As we run a second meta-analysis relying on partial correlations, we also included studies that facilitated the calculation of partial correlations (i.e., studies using regression analyses and providing t statistics and degrees of freedom). We accounted for the issue of non-independent samples by excluding studies based on the same data set. If we found different versions of a study, one published and others in the form of working papers, we included the published version. If we found several published versions of a study that used the same data set, we included the version with the largest number of firms (Rosenbusch, Rauch, & Bausch, 2013). By applying these criteria, we yielded a final sample of 149 studies, from which we calculated a total of 245 bivariate correlations (k = 245) that in sum are based on 201,511 observations (N = 201,511) and a total of 208 partial correlations (k = 208) based on 179,318 observations (N = 179,318). It should be noted that there is some overlap between both study samples because several studies provided both bivariate correlations as well as statistics allowing the calculation of partial correlations.13\n\n# Meta-analytic procedures\n\nIn line with recent meta-analyses in management research (e.g., Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, van Essen, & van Oosterhout, 2011; van Essen et al., in press) we used Hedges-Olkin-type meta-analysis (HOMA) (H\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
