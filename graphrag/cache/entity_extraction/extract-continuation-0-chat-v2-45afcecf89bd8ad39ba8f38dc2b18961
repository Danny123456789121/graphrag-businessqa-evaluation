That in turn has sped up the pace at which automation may be deployed and expanded the types of workers who will experience its impact. Like other technologies, its ability to take on routine tasks and work can increase human productivity, which has grown at a below-average rate for almost 20 years. It can also offset the impact of aging, which is beginning to put a dent in workforce growth for many of the world’s major economies. But to achieve these benefits, a significant number of workers will need to substantially change the work they do, either in their existing occupations or in new ones. They will also need support in making transitions to new activities.\n\n# 46 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n47\n\n# Considerations for businesses and society\n\nHistory has shown that new technologies have the potential to reshape societies. Artificial intelligence has already changed the way we live and work—for example, it can help our phones (mostly) understand what we say, or draft emails. Mostly, however, AI has remained behind the scenes, optimizing business processes or making recommendations about the next product to buy. The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment the impact of AI overall, generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and transforming the nature of work.\n\nBut the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must act—and quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to address both the opportunities and the risks.
