The result shows that weighted average effect size is not significantly different from zero, suggesting that SRI performance is not different from conventional investments. Meta-regression results regarding sampling issues indicate that economic crisis, control group, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds are important determinants of effect sizes, and publication year, author type, and control group are important factors of the absolute value of effect sizes. Regarding methodological issues, risk adjustment, weighting scheme, data refinement, benchmark model, and matching procedure are significant factors determining the absolute value of effect sizes.\n\n# Keywords\n\nEffect size; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; Random-effect model; Socially responsible investment\n\n# JEL Classification\n\nG11, G32, M14\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nResearchers and investors have long been curious about whether socially responsible investment (SRI) funds and portfolios financially outperform conventional ones. Early studies date back to the 1970s (Moskowitz, 1972; Alexander and ...\n\n*This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A5B8925203).

Kim\n\nBuchholz, 1978), and a significant amount of research has been accumulated so far.1 However, existing evidence shows mixed results. For example, Auer (2016) shows that investors can do financially well while doing social good based on environmental, social, and governance ratings data for the European market. However, Renneboog et al. (2008a) report that the SRI funds of France, Ireland, Sweden, and Japan significantly underperform conventional funds by 4–7% per annum during the period 1991–2003. In addition, there are many other papers that report no difference in performance between SRI and conventional funds (Hamilton et al., 1993; Kreander et al., 2005; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Hoepner and Schopohl, 2018).\n\nIt is imperative to determine the overall influence of SRI on investment performance, because if the impact is positive, investors will voluntarily participate in socially beneficial investments and government does not have to intervene in the market to promote social goals. If the impact is negative, however, investors have to sacrifice their investment benefits to pursue their social preferences and the public sector has to intervene in one way or another to encourage SRI activities. The direction and magnitude of SRI influence can also have a profound implication for financial industries with respect to product development, asset management, fiduciary duty, performance evaluation, and so forth. Understanding the impact of SRI is also important to academic research. As Combs et al. (2011) point out, without a proper synthesis of existing literature more fruitful further research is difficult.\n\nDespite this, there have been few attempts to synthesize existing literature on SRI and even these have not been successful. For example, Rathner (2013) lacks representativeness due to a small sample size and incomplete methodology. Revelli and Viviani (2015) performed a meta-analysis based on 85 studies. However, they fail to draw a sharp conclusion due to ambiguity caused by pooling several countries in one sample. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) show that culture is an important determinant of SRI influence, so combining countries with different cultural backgrounds will prevent researchers from obtaining a correct picture of SRI.2 More importantly, they analyze the impact of moderators only on effect size (hereafter, ES) ignoring the impact on the absolute value of effect size (hereafter, AES).\n\n1 SRI is different from corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR focuses on corporate social activities and papers on CSR examine whether firms can improve financial performance by engaging in socially desirable activities. SRI focuses on investment strategies that employ various screening procedures (e.g., positive, negative, and best-in-the-class) based on so-called ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria and papers on SRI compare the investment performance of these portfolio strategies with conventional ones.\n\n2 Moreover, their study seems to have multiple errors. For example, they include Smith (1996), which is an event study, even though they explicitly mention that they do not include event studies in the text. Gregory et al. (1997) have a Hedges’ g value of 0.24 in their Appendix, but the sign should be negative since the ethical funds performed worse than the non-ethical funds.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nAlthough many valuable conjectures can be made regarding AES. This point is especially important in the current situation where positive and negative effects coexist, since focusing only on the level of ESs will average out positive and negative impacts leading researchers to underestimate the impact of SRI. To our knowledge, our paper is the first that investigates the influence of moderators on both ESs and AESs.\n\nAnother reason for the lack of sound summary papers is the diversity and complexity of existing studies with regard to samples, methodologies, performance measures, investment universe, benchmarks, etc. A meta-analysis is a very useful scientific tool to syn\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT<|>EVENT<|>Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) refers to investment strategies that consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in addition to financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREA<|>GEO<|>Republic of Korea is a country in East Asia, where the research on SRI was supported by the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C.-S.
