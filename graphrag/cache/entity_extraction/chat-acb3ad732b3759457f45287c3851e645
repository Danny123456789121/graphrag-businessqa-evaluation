Drawing on Carroll’s (1979) CSR construct, Aupperle et al. (1985) developed a forced-choice survey instrument to assess a corporate respondent’s social-responsibility orientation. This forced-choice methodology is commonly used to minimize the social desirability of responses. But survey methodologies still have problems relating to return rates and a common method bias when testing the relationship between CSR and CFP.\n\nTo deal with the measurement problems noted above, the firm Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD) constructed an index of Corporate Social Performance (CSP) based on eight corporate social performance attributes rated consistently across the entire Standard and Poor’s 500. As an independent rating service that focuses exclusively on assessment of corporate social performance across a range of dimensions related to stakeholder concerns, KLD exhibits robust construct validity around its underlying measures (see Hart & Sharfman, 2012) and has been used by a number of researchers in strategy (Waddock & Graves, 1997), human resources (Turban & Greening, 1997), business and society (Mattingly & Berman, 2006), and finance (Fisman, Heal, & Nair, 2005). The use of the KLD data set, however, is not without its critics. The most serious query is credulity problems, because the data can be and are often stretched to meet the objectives of individual researchers (Godfrey et al., 2009).\n\nThe one-dimensional proxy is another frequently used method (Lev et al., 2010; H. Wang et al., 2008). Pollution control investment and corporate philanthropy are usually employed as unidimensional proxy measures for CSR (Bowman & Haire, 1975; Brammer & Millington, 2005). The one-dimensional proxy variable is viewed as a highly visible and objective component with specific attributes that make it particularly amenable to empirical research. But it may not properly reflect the overall level of a company’s CSR and may be difficult to apply consistently across the range of industries and companies that need to be studied (Waddock & Graves, 1997).\n\nAs noted, each measurement strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is not easy to capture a truly representative CSR measure in the relevant social domains. Waddock and Graves (1997) suggested that the previous mixed findings on the relationship between profitability and corporate social performance may be partly caused by measurement difficulties. Consequently, the whole sample will be divided into five subsets to examine\n\n# Business & Society\n\nwhether CSR measurement strategies moderate the relationship between CSR and CFP. The authors posit the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 3:\n\nDifferent CSR measurement strategies will lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies.\n\nBesides the different operationalizations of CSR, Wood and Jones (1995) were concerned about the stakeholder mismatching problem due to the different financial performance measures, which are focused on different aspects of performance with each one subject to particular biases. Three types of CFP measurement have been tested as dependent variables in previous studies: (a) accounting-based performance (Return on Assets [ROA] or Return on Equity [ROE]), (b) market-based performance (price to earnings ratio or Tobin’s Q), and (c) perceptual measures, such as self-reported surveys of market share, growth, profitability, or size in comparison with other organizations. In this article, the moderate effects of CFP measurements are also examined as follows:\n\n# Hypothesis 4:\n\nDifferent CFP measurement strategies will lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies.\n\n# Contingency Factors as Moderators of the CSR–CFP Relationship\n\nThe authors posit that CSR is positively related to firm financial performance. Furthermore, the authors expect the relationship between CSR and CFP to vary significantly among different operational environments. Some scholars have begun to notice that returns to CSR are contingent, not universal (Ullmann, 1985). Barnett (2007) argued that CSR cannot universally produce favorable returns for all firms all the time, so favorable findings will never be replicable across all data sets. Therefore, researchers should attempt to find contingency factors that explain heterogeneity in financial returns to CSR. Accordingly, two environmental contingency factors, namely, market development and institutional environment, are critical in determining the extent to which firms might benefit from charitable contributions (Doh & Guay, 2006; H. Wang & Qian, 2011).\n\nAs mentioned before, CSR contributes to the bottom line via its favorable influence on the firm’s relationships with important stakeholders. The stakeholder relationship is the key mechanism through which firms can gain positive returns from CSR activities. Furthermore, firm visibility serves as a prerequisite for stakeholder response to firm actions (H. Wang & Qian, 2011).\n\n# Wang et al.\n\nStakeholders need to have the information regarding firms’ social behavior to make a reasonable response. Therefore, when visible firms can draw greater attention from their stakeholders, it will be easier for them to get positive responses from stakeholders. In contrast, firms may not benefit much from social involvement under a low firm visibility and stakeholder awareness, even if they have invested a lot in CSR. Obviously, a firm’s visibility and stakeholder awareness vary significantly across different levels of development of the market in which the firm operates. Due to the various information channels and effective market supervision, business information will be more symmetric and valid in a developed market. Then, the stakeholders can obtain information about firms’ social behavior more efficiently and make responses more accurately. Subsequently, those responses for CSR will turn into positive financial gains. But the situation is different in a developing market.
