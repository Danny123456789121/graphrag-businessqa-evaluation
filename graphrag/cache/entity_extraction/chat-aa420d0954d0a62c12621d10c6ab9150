As the concentration on a single direction of causality does not allow general conclusions, several primary studies contrast the two causal directions. Ameer and Othman (2012) and Makni et al. (2009) confirm a negative influence of CEP on CFP after 1 year. Horváthová (2012) extends this result by finding that CEP leads to a CFP decrease after 1 year, but firms profit from CEP after 2 years. Hart and Ahuja (1996) suggest that CEP has a positive effect after 1 year for accounting‐based CFP measures and after 2 years for market‐based CFP measures, because it takes some time until the market recognizes a firm's environmental performance. Using a 1‐year lag, Nakao, Amano, Matsumura, Genba, and Nakano (2007) even find significant effects for both causal directions. However, they add that CEP increases CFP only recently, but the positive effect from CFP to CEP exists longer. In contrast, CEP does not affect future CFP according to Alvarez (2012). Heras‐Saizarbitoria, Molina‐Azorín, and Dick (2011) find in a longitudinal study that CEP does at least conditionally increase CFP. Their results imply that firms that are more profitable prefer investing in CEP, although there are also weak anticipation effects of investors. However, they state that firms do not profit from enhanced CEP in the future. In this context, Kim and Statman (2012) propose that the positive relation between CFP and CEP is greater in times of CFP increases in contrast to periods of CFP decreases. In contrast, Levy (1995) reveals that the effect is insignificant for both causal directions using a 1‐year lag. Overall, primary studies show inconclusive results for the general question of the causality between CEP and CFP, which might especially stem from different variable measures, sample compositions, and estimation methods (Guenther et al., 2012; Guenther & Hoppe, 2014). Overall, empirical evidence from primary studies is fragmented and inconsistent.\n\nConsidering these circumstances, several meta‐analyses review the cumulative results of the literature by quantitatively aggregating existing primary studies. Dixon‐Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, and Romi (2013) examine the causality by comparing the reported results in the form of 202 Pearson correlation coefficients from 39 studies measuring CEP and CFP concurrently with measuring CFP 1 or more years ahead. However, they find no significant difference between the two groups. The causality from CFP to CEP is not analyzed due to a lack of data. Dixon‐Fowler et al. (2013) encourage to also “examine this important relationship.” Furthermore, Endrikat et al. (2014) analyze the causality between CEP and CFP based on 245 Pearson correlation coefficients from 149 primary studies and additionally take the reverse causality into account. Because they use multidimensional subgroups by splitting the sample according to the analyzed causality and the variable measurement, a general understanding of the causality is still not possible. Their results reveal statistically and economically significant effects from CEP to CFP for process‐based CEP and subsequent accounting‐based CFP as well as for outcome‐based CEP and subsequent market‐based CFP. Moreover, they find statistically and economically significant effects for all specifications measuring CEP and CFP concurrently. In contrast, they find no evidence for CFP affecting CEP. The meta‐analyses by Albertini (2013), Guenther et al. (2012), and Horváthová (2010) do not analyze the causality issue at all. This summary demonstrates that meta‐analytical literature addressing this question is also characterized by mixed results and various study designs providing only insufficient answers to the question of causality.\n\nThis study aims to provide the first complete analysis of the CEP–CFP causality by means of meta‐analysis using a sample of 893 existing results drawn from 142 empirical primary studies and contributes to prior primary studies as well as meta‐analyses in the following ways. We thoroughly analyze the following three relations: CEP affecting CFP, CFP affecting CEP, and the bidirectional impact. Furthermore, we investigate the temporal development of the effects by including yearly lagged effects up to 5 years, which has yet not been done in previous literature. This approach allows more general and fine‐grained conclusions regarding CEP–CFP causality. In contrast to prior reviews, we use the partial correlation coefficient derived from regression coefficients to measure the bivariate relationship. As advantages over traditional Pearson correlation coefficients as used in the majority of previous literature, disruptive effects are filtered out in order to isolate the effect of interest. Moreover, primary studies mostly report multiple results in their regression analysis (for different time periods, model specifications, and other subgroups) but only few studies report Pearson correlations. Accordingly, the use to partial correlations computed from regression results maximize the sample of primary studies and effect sizes to be included in the meta‐analysis. Moreover, we also test for the potential presence of publication bias. In general, publication selection bias refers to the phenomenon that certain estimates are systematically underrepresented in empirical literature (Rosenthal, 1979). In other words, publication selection bias exists when researchers prefer statistically significant results or results that are consistent with the theory and previous research outcomes (Stanley, 2005). One potential source of publication bias might be the selective reporting of results depending on the number of lagged years (Bruns & Stern, 2018). Finally, we explore the heterogeneity of results by applying a meta\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
