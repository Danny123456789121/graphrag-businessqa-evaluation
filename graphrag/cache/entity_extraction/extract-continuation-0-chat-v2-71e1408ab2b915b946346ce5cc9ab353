A CSR committee can also serve as a buffer, mitigating potential negative effects of CEO–chair duality on CSR activities. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:\n\n# Hypothesis 5 (H5):\n\nThe presence of a CSR committee (partially) mediates the relationships between CSR and board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality.\n\n# Moderators of Board Characteristics–CSR Relationships\n\nMeta-analysis not only determines the overall strength and direction of a relationship but also allows for an examination of potential moderating effects. In this sense, meta-analysis allows the identification of boundary conditions that cannot be explored by primary studies that rely on data within these boundaries. We next hypothesize possible moderators of the focal board characteristics–CSR relationships.\n\nAn emerging stream of literature highlights the importance of country-level institutional factors in determining firm strategies and practices (Carney et al., 2011; Heugens et al., 2009). CSR practices and activities have also been shown to be contingent upon institutional settings, such as the legal and political systems, regulatory stringency, and culture (Jain & Jamali, 2016). CSR activities usually affect firm outcomes indirectly via stakeholders’ reactions (H. Wang et al., 2016). Given that stakeholder attitudes vary across countries (Matten & Moon, 2008), it is not surprising that CSR-related relationships vary by country (Ioannou & Serafeim, 2012).\n\nMoreover, previous research has shown that both formal and informal institutional mechanisms significantly determine corporate governance practices and characteristics of the boards of directors (Aguilera & Jackson, 2010; Grosvold, 2011; J. Li & Harrison, 2008). In fact, scholars argue that the mixed empirical findings in corporate governance studies may be due to the neglect of contextual issues (Aguilera et al., 2012; Filatotchev, 2008). In particular, it is argued that certain country-level governance systems, such as\n\ncorporate ownership structures, the legal system, and corporate law, significantly determine the effectiveness of corporate governance. This implies that these country-level factors could substitute or complement corporate governance aspects. Mechanisms are substitutes when an increase in one mechanism directly replaces a portion of the other (i.e., functional replacement); in contrast, two mechanisms are complements when an increase in one leads to an increasing effect of the other mechanism (i.e., synergistic effect) (Aguilera et al., 2012). For example, long-term bank-firm relationships, which are typical for Germany and Japan, may effectively substitute for an active market of control (Filatotchev, 2007). Or high levels of blockholder ownership may partially substitute for board independence (Aguilera et al., 2012; Oh et al. (2018)).\n\nOne of the key institutional factors affecting corporate governance choices is shareholder protection (La Porta et al., 2000; Leuz et al., 2003). Strong and well enforced legal protection of shareholder rights limits expropriation risks and may decrease the need for boards of directors to monitor and avoids managerial discretion (Villaron-Peramato et al., 2018). Thus, strong shareholder protection might effectively substitute for the monitoring role of corporate boards implying weaker effects of board characteristics on CSR.\n\nHowever, an alternative argument has been brought forward by Post and Byron (2015). They propose that stronger shareholder protection may provide increased motivation to corporate boards to strive for and take into account the multiple perspectives of board members and to integrate the divergent expertise and values held by different board members (Byron & Post, 2016; Post and Byron, 2015). Hence, shareholder protection is likely to motivate boards to more effectively capitalize on their CSR resources, suggesting that shareholder protection could complement—instead of substitute for—boards characteristics’ impact on CSR. Given the two competing perspectives, we offer a nondirectional hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 6 (H6): A country’s shareholder protection level moderates the relationships between CSR and board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, CEO–chair duality, and the presence of a CSR committee.\n\nPost and Byron’s (2015) meta-analysis on the relationship between female board representation and firm financial performance finds that a country’s level of gender parity significantly moderates the relationship. Byron and Post (2016) show that this country-level factor also moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR. In contexts with greater gender parity (i.e., contexts in which men and women are more similar in terms of\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\n# 13\n\neducation, economic participation, health, and political empowerment, the distribution of power between male and female board members will be more balanced and thus women will be more likely to be heard and considered in decision-making processes (Byron and Post, 2016). In other words, a country’s level of gender parity may complement the positive effect of female board representation on CSR. Because our sample of studies differs from those of Byron and Post (2016) in that we include more recent studies—in particular, studies published after the year 2015, which is the last year covered by Byron and Post (2016)—we deem it necessary to revisit these relationships. We hypothesize the following:\n\n# Hypothesis 7 (H7):\n\nCountries’ gender parity positively moderates the relationship between CSR and female representation on boards.\n\nCSR is a multidimensional construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; H. Wang et al., 2016). Different studies use different measures of overall CSR performance and/or different measures of specific dimensions of CSR. Aggregate measures of CSR subsume dimensions\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSR COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A committee that mediates relationships between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and board characteristics, such as board size and independence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and oversee the activities of a company, influencing CSR activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Factors at the national level that influence firm strategies and practices, including legal and political systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDER PARITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A measure of equality between genders in various aspects such as education, economic participation, and political empowerment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRM STRATEGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plans and actions taken by a company to achieve its goals, which can be influenced by CSR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR PRACTICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Activities undertaken by companies to meet their social responsibilities and impact stakeholders positively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Legal frameworks that safeguard the rights of shareholders, influencing corporate governance and CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEO-CHAIR DUALITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A governance structure where the CEO also serves as the chair of the board, potentially affecting CSR activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEMALE REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The presence of women on corporate boards, which can influence decision-making and CSR outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>A statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies to determine overall trends and relationships.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR COMMITTEE<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The CSR committee works alongside the board of directors to enhance CSR activities and governance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS<|>FIRM STRATEGIES<|>Country-level factors significantly influence the strategies firms adopt, particularly regarding CSR<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENDER PARITY<|>FEMALE REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS<|>Higher gender parity in a country positively affects the representation of women on boards<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>Strong shareholder protection influences the effectiveness of the board of directors in monitoring and governance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEO-CHAIR DUALITY<|>CSR PRACTICES<|>The duality of CEO and chair roles can impact the effectiveness of CSR practices within a firm<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEMALE REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS<|>CSR PRACTICES<|>Increased female representation on boards can enhance the effectiveness of CSR practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>CSR PRACTICES<|>Meta-analysis helps in understanding the overall effectiveness and trends in CSR practices across studies<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
