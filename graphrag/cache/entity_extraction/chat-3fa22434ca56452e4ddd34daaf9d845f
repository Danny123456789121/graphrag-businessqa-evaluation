Section 2 presents a review of the literature about supplier selection (SS) and sustainability in order to provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem. AHP, DEMATEL and BN for supplier selection problems will be the focus. The new approach, AHP-DEMATEL-BN, is explained and tested with a real case study in Section 3. The results are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes and suggests some research avenues.\n\n# 2. Literature Review\n\nMany studies have demonstrated the importance of the supplier selection decision and its impact on overall supply chain network efficiency. Although SS is largely studied, the literature on sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem is more limited [10]. SSS has been receiving more attention in recent years. Prior to 2005, there were only few papers, more or less one per year on SSS topics, reaching around 38 papers in 2014 [5]. Sustainable supplier selection faces similar methodological trends as those observed in supplier selection research. We shall only introduce some papers that have used the tools, separately, that we integrate in this study, to provide a foundation of the state-of-the-art modeling studies.\n\nThe literature considers multiple aspects of supplier selection. Sometimes, the focus is on a particular sustainability dimension. For example, the economic aspect for ranking suppliers is studied using AHP according to some criteria such as price, quality, delivery, and service using the case\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\nof the automotive industry in the developing country of Pakistan [ 11 ]. The authors highlighted the importance of developing a simple methodology for managers of the automotive industry so that they can select the best suppliers.\n\nAHP as a standalone method has been used for evaluating criteria and ranking suppliers based on corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions [ 12 ]. These dimensions include human rights, underage labor, female labor, low working hours, pollution, safeguarding mechanisms and organizational legal responsibilities.\n\nAHP has been also combined with a variety of methods; showing the flexibility of this tool, which we take advantage of in this study as well. As an example, some have used AHP to prioritize criteria and then VIKOR to rank suppliers [13 ]. Other studies identify the best sustainable supplier in similar ways but utilize TOPSIS instead of VIKOR as in [14]. Some studies have expanded supplier evaluation to multiple supply chain levels using these techniques [ 15 ]. Integration of statistical uncertainties into these joint MCDM models has not been explicitly completed.\n\nStudies have also sought to link DEMATEL as a technique with MCDM approaches in order to consider interactions among criteria with selection purposes, e.g., [ 16 ]. Suggestions to add some sustainable criteria into these joint models have also appeared in studies [17, 18]. These and other works further highlight the necessity to integrate social criteria to advance their models [19].\n\nSome studies have applied BN to supplier selection. BN can model the uncertainty and vagueness of human information [20 ]. It translates the decision-maker’s knowledge into probabilistic relationships. BN is capable of capturing tangible and intangible variables [21]. It is capable of integrating a learning process [ 22 ]. This integrative characteristic makes it even more valuable for the supplier selection process, since there are numerous uncertainties, from objective performance to intangible characteristics such as relational building. The relationship graphs within BN provide insights into the decision-maker’s understanding and thought processes. BN has traditionally been used as a standalone approach, and it can integrate broader frameworks [22 ]. For example, linking BN and total cost of ownership gives a dual perspective to buyer–supplier decision-makers [ 20, 23]. The malleability of BN and its advantages can help to address the disadvantages of other techniques that may not show a good path and uncertainty effectively.\n\nDEMATEL may be used to elicit the BN structure. This rare integrative model is not a decision tool but is used for the structured analysis of relationships [19]. Adding MCDM methods to support decision-making has been recommended for this integrative approach. A recommended research avenue is to reinforce the descriptive model in using MCDM methods with DEMATEL and BN [ 24 ]. It is this additional step which we take—one that complements each of the various tools, allowing for more robust decision-making and analysis for sustainable supplier selection modeling.\n\nIn sustainable supplier selection (SSS), only two studies have used BN or Bayesian approaches [9, 25 ]. A Bayesian framework is provided and tested with an illustrative example to select a supplier for sustainable operations [ 9 ]. The resilience of suppliers in using forward and backward propagation analysis is studied [25 ], but not specifically for sustainable suppliers. The authors integrate resilience, green and primary indicators in their model. Then, they test it with a numerical sample. These studies have utilized operational criteria such as lead time, cost and quality alongside green criteria such as carbon emissions and environmental practices. They stipulate that other criteria need to be incorporated into their models. They indicate that further investigation needs to be extended to other supply chains and real data.\n\nIn our study, an additional research avenue is to apply the extended model of [ 24 ] to a real case of sustainable supplier evaluation and selection as suggested by [9]. A summary of studies in supplier selection problems is presented in Table 1, focusing on methods and types of decision criteria according to the triple bottom line (TBL) approach for supplier selection and evaluation.\n\n|References|Year|Decision Criteria|Methods|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|[22]|2011|Eco.|BN, Total cost of ownership|\n|[16]|2011|Eco.|DEMATEL, TOPSIS|\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
