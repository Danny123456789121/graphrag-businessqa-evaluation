Examples of such indices are the ones created by market institutions like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index of the New York Stock Exchange; the FTSE-4Good in the London Stock Exchange; the Johannesburg Index in South Africa; and the Brazilian ISE set up by the Brazilian stock market.\n\n# 2.2 The Brazilian corporate sustainability index\n\nThe ISE index is a theoretical portfolio, composed by up to 40 firms that are included into it based on an assessment process conducted by the ISE Advisory Committee. This committee is composed by 11 institutions, being headed by the Sa˜ o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) (Cunha and Samanez, 2013; BM&FBOVESPA, 2015). The information used in the assessment process is supplied by the company through a questionnaire. A firm that intends to participate in the ISE assessment process must fulfill the following requirements (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015):\n\n- the firm must be among the 200 most traded in the stock market in the past year;\n- the firm must have been traded in at least 50 per cent of the stock exchange sessions in the preceding year;\n\n# 2.2 ISE Assessment Process\n\nThe firm must comply with the criteria endorsed by the ISE Advisory Committee Executive Council.\n\nThe ISE assessment process comprises seven areas or axes, related to both CSR and sustainability, distributed along the questionnaire:\n\n- The axis “general information” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses how the firm behaves in relation to global agreements and whether the firm publishes social reports.\n- The axis “nature of the product” (9.5 per cent of the questions) requires information about the risks and damages for human health associated with the firm’s products.\n- The axis “corporate governance” (17 per cent of the questions) intends to evaluate shareholders relationships and the quality of the firm’s corporate governance system.\n- The axis “financial-economics” (10 per cent of the questions) captures information about firm’s strategic planning, risk management and financial performance.\n- The axis “social” (14 per cent of the questions) tries to assess firm’s relations with workers, suppliers and clients.\n- The axis “climate change” (25 per cent of the questions) appraises whether the company is actually committed to policies for climate change prevention.\n- The axis “environmental” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses firm’s concern with the natural environmental through the analysis of the number of problems with environmental licenses, or criminal prosecution because of environmental crimes.\n\nInvited firms respond the ISE questionnaire in a voluntary manner. Firm assessment is based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis is based on the questionnaire score, in which all CSP axes have the same weight, with specific criteria and indicators in each axis. The qualitative analysis is based on the checking of supporting documents that are also requested from companies. Then, cluster analysis is run with the purpose of identifying groups of firms with similar CSP and make up firm ranking to compose the ISE portfolio that integrates up to the 40 best performing firms (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).\n\n# 2.3 Determinants of Corporate Sustainability Performance\n\nThe determinants of CSP are analyzed under distinct theoretical frameworks. Some firm’s attributes have been seen as able to affect CSP. Among such factors are, for example, firm size, profitability and leverage. More recently, agency conflicts, firm industry environmental risk as well as growth opportunities have also been considered.\n\nThere is evidence that ownership structure moderates agency conflicts among the main firm stakeholders. For instance, agency conflicts between shareholders and managers are moderated by ownership structure (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Furthermore, there is evidence that ownership structure matters for firm value and performance as well as for firm strategic and financial policies (Allen and Phillips, 2000; Goergen and Renneboog, 2001; Schiantarelli and Sembenelli, 2000). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that ownership structure may also influence firm’s sustainability policy (Aguilera et al., 2007).\n\nResearch in different markets signals that ownership structure characteristics may matter for firm’s sustainability policy, under distinct arguments, although with inconclusive results (Faller and zu Knyphausen-Aufseß, 2016). For example, there is a positive effect of high firm ownership concentration in hands of the main shareholder on CSR in Spain (Godos Dı´ez et al., 2012). Equity ownership held by individual shareholder types has also received special attention. Institutional investors have a positive effect on CSR in USA.\n\n(Harjoto and Jo, 2008). Government ownership favors CSR in Singapore and Malaysia (Eng and Mak, 2003; Said et al., 2009). In USA, internal ownership has a negative impact on CSR (Barnea and Rubin, 2010) and non-state ownership has an adverse effect on CSR in China (Li and Zhang, 2010). In Europe, ownership concentration held by the main shareholder is also detrimental to CSR (Lopez-Iturriaga and Lopez-de-Foronda, 2011). Ownership structure playing a role on firm’s policies is closely linked to the agency theory given that its influence may raise or minimize agency conflicts.\n\nFirm controlling shareholders, who are common in high ownership concentrated firms, are interested in improving firm reputation which may be obtained from social and sustainability policies according to the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical approaches (Chiu and Sharfman, 2011). Thus, they may use social and sustainability policy to achieve this goal by prioritizing social and sustainability elements that may be more favorable to their purpose.\n\nHigh concentrated ownership, frequently associated to a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dow Jones Sustainability Index is a stock market index that evaluates the sustainability performance of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FTSE-4GOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FTSE-4Good is a series of ethical investment stock market indices that measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong environmental, social, and governance practices on the London Stock Exchange.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHANNESBURG INDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Johannesburg Index is a sustainability index that assesses the performance of companies in South Africa based on their corporate social responsibility practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZILIAN ISE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Brazilian ISE is a corporate sustainability index that evaluates companies based on their social and environmental performance in Brazil.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BM&FBOVESPA is the main stock exchange in Brazil, responsible for the management of the Brazilian ISE and other financial instruments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISE ADVISORY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ISE Advisory Committee is composed of 11 institutions that oversee the assessment process for the Brazilian ISE index.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISE ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>EVENT<|>The ISE assessment process evaluates firms based on their sustainability practices and corporate social responsibility through a questionnaire.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Sustainability Performance refers to the evaluation of a company's sustainability practices and their impact on social and environmental factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENCY THEORY<|>EVENT<|>Agency theory is a concept that explains the relationship between principals and agents in business, particularly regarding ownership structure and its impact on firm performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE<|>EVENT<|>Ownership structure refers to the distribution of ownership in a company, which can influence its governance and sustainability policies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>BM&FBOVESPA manages the Brazilian ISE, which is similar to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in evaluating corporate sustainability<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FTSE-4GOOD<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>BM&FBOVESPA's ISE is comparable to the FTSE-4Good, as both assess companies based on sustainability criteria<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHANNESBURG INDEX<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>BM&FBOVESPA's ISE is similar to the Johannesburg Index, both focusing on corporate sustainability in their respective regions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAZILIAN ISE<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>BM&FBOVESPA is responsible for the Brazilian ISE, which evaluates corporate sustainability in Brazil<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISE ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>ISE ADVISORY COMMITTEE<|>The ISE Advisory Committee oversees the ISE assessment process, ensuring firms are evaluated fairly<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>ISE ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>The ISE assessment process is designed to evaluate Corporate Sustainability Performance (CSP) of firms<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE<|>AGENCY THEORY<|>Ownership structure is a key concept in agency theory, influencing firm governance and performance<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
