Second, picking up anecdotal evidence, which suggests stronger market reactions to negative events compared with positive ones, this work offers theoretical reasoning for this phenomenon and incorporates this issue in the meta-analytic investigation. Finally, by conducting exploratory moderator analyses (Geyskens et al. 2006; Kirca et al. 2012), this article examines potential moderation effects arising from methodological artifacts such as different study design and sample characteristics.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, the theoretical background is presented from which the hypotheses are derived. Second, the data as well as the methodology employed are explained. The presentation of the results of the analyses follows. Finally, the findings are discussed and important implications highlighted.\n\n# Background and Development of Hypotheses\n\n# CEP-Related Events and the Link between CEP and CFP\n\nThe event study methodology was developed in finance (e.g., Brown and Warner 1985) and has been widely applied in management research (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Event studies examine whether there are abnormal stock price effects due to announcements of unanticipated events or changes with regard to managerial decisions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999). The crucial assumption underlying event studies refers to the efficient\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\nMarket hypothesis, which proposes that markets are able to anticipate and correctly interpret relevant news and quickly adjust security prices (Fama 1991; Frooman 1997). While it is commonly known that stock markets are not information perfect, they are considered to work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy by continually assessing and valuing new information (Frooman 1997; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). Therefore, in cases of major events, abnormal returns (ARs) or cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) (i.e., significantly greater positive or negative returns) that accrue for the particular firm allow inferring that the event significantly influences the value of the firm (Frooman 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999).\n\nThe earliest event study examining ARs as consequence of CEP-related events, to the best knowledge of the author, was provided by Shane and Spicer (1983). They examined how the stock market reacted to releases of pollution control reports by the Council on Economic Priorities and found relatively large negative ARs especially for firms with low pollution control performance. Another prominent example is the study of Klassen and McLaughlin (1996), who analyzed the market reactions to (1) third-party announcements of environmental awards signaling superior CEP and to (2) environmental crises (e.g., oil spills) signaling weak CEP. They found significant positive returns for firms receiving an environmental award and significant negative returns for firms involved in an environmental crisis. While the majority of earlier studies focused on the US and usually examined announcements associated with pollution information, in recent times several event studies have been conducted in other institutional settings (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012) and incorporated a broader range of CEP-related events. For example, Gilley et al. (2000) provided an event study focusing on the announcement of product- and process-driven environmental initiatives. While they found no overall effect of such announcements on stock returns, the results of their study suggest differences in the market reaction with regard to the specific type of the environmental initiative announced. In particular, the stock market reacted more positively to product-driven initiatives compared to process-driven initiatives. Robinson et al. (2011) investigated how the stock market reacted to the inclusion of firms in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and found significant increases in market value for the firms being included in the index. Keele and DeHart (2011) examined the market reactions to the announcement of firms‚Äô participation in the USEPA Climate Leaders program and found no statistically significant market reaction on the day of the announcement.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the efficient market hypothesis is not free from criticism. In particular, behavioral finance scholars have challenged the different forms of the efficient market hypothesis (e.g., Shleifer 2000).\n\nWhile the events examined by event studies are admittedly single discrete events, they signal cumulative environmental performance and future positioning to the marketplace (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). For example, an announcement of green supply chain initiatives can be considered a public signal with regard to a firm‚Äôs decision towards a proactive environmental strategy. This information is deemed to be rapidly impounded in the stock price so that a change in its value implies a change in the market assessment of a firm‚Äôs net present value and thus reflects the market‚Äôs perception of the financial impact of signaled CEP (Gilley et al. 2000; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996).\n\nSeveral theoretical arguments have been put forward with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP involving different manifestations and mechanisms (Guenther and Hoppe 2014). In particular, the early literature rooted in neoclassical economics (e.g., Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958) argued that environmental activities would withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance because the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs. Furthermore, drawing on agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976), scholars suggested that managers could opportunistically employ corporate resources to engage in environmental activities that enhance their own utility at the expense of good financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2008). For instance, managers may try to justify disappointing financial outcomes by engaging in conspicuous environmental activities (Prest\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COUNCIL ON ECONOMIC PRIORITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Council on Economic Priorities is an organization that releases pollution control reports and has been studied for its impact on stock market reactions to environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dow Jones Sustainability Index is a stock market index that evaluates the sustainability performance of companies and has been linked to market reactions upon firms' inclusion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USEPA CLIMATE LEADERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The USEPA Climate Leaders program is an initiative that encourages companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has been studied for its market impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANE AND SPICER<|>PERSON<|>Shane and Spicer are researchers who conducted an early event study examining market reactions to pollution control reports.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KLASSEN AND MCLAUGHLIN<|>PERSON<|>Klassen and McLaughlin are researchers who analyzed market reactions to environmental awards and crises.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILLEY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Gilley et al. are researchers who focused on the announcement of environmental initiatives and their effects on stock returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBINSON ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Robinson et al. are researchers who investigated market reactions to firms included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEELE AND DEHART<|>PERSON<|>Keele and DeHart are researchers who examined market reactions to announcements of participation in the USEPA Climate Leaders program.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT STUDY METHODOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Event study methodology is a research approach used to assess the impact of specific events on stock prices, particularly in finance and management research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET REACTION<|>EVENT<|>Market reaction refers to the changes in stock prices in response to new information or events, particularly regarding environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHANE AND SPICER<|>COUNCIL ON ECONOMIC PRIORITIES<|>Shane and Spicer conducted a study on how the stock market reacted to pollution control reports released by the Council on Economic Priorities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KLASSEN AND MCLAUGHLIN<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>Klassen and McLaughlin analyzed market reactions to environmental awards, which are relevant to firms included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBINSON ET AL.<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>Robinson et al. studied how the stock market reacted to firms being included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEELE AND DEHART<|>USEPA CLIMATE LEADERS<|>Keele and DeHart examined market reactions to announcements related to the USEPA Climate Leaders program<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILLEY ET AL.<|>EVENT STUDY METHODOLOGY<|>Gilley et al. utilized event study methodology to assess the impact of environmental initiatives on stock returns<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKET REACTION<|>EVENT STUDY METHODOLOGY<|>Market reaction is a key focus of event study methodology, assessing how specific events influence stock prices<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
