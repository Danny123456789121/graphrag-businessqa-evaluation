In turn, we hypothesize:\n\n# H3d: Studies on mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to studies using other CFP measures.\n\n# Moderating Factors\n\nThe literature discusses a range of conditions under which CSP and CFP influence each other (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). In addition to the most common factors – company size and the type of industry.\n\n© 2018 The Authors. Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nCorp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 2018\n\nDOI: 10.1002/csr\n\nT. Busch and G. Friede\n\n(Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Buehler & Shetty, 1974; Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky, 2008) – several other moderating factors have been used in primary studies. These are visibility to the public and consumers (Fry, Keim, & Meiners, 1982; Jiang & Bansal, 2003), research and development investments (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000), economic conditions (Golicic & Smith, 2013), the level of diversification, advertising, government sales, consumer income, and stage in the industry as well as the firm life cycle (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Elsayed & Paton, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Since not all primary studies use the same bundle of control variables and/or moderating factors, it is difficult to compare such effects in meta-analyses. Thus, as meta-analysts have not adjusted for these factors in a comparable manner, we also cannot investigate these effects. Nonetheless, a few central moderating factors can be assessed at second-order level.\n\n# Effects over Time\n\nIt is not unusual that academic studies investigating a specific effect for the first time demonstrate impressive effect sizes which partly diminish in subsequent research studies (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Griffin and Mahon (1997) have already called for research that looks at the CSP-CFP relation over time. To date, it is still an open question as to whether this is a time-independent relation. Scholars suggest that institutional investors increasingly focus on stakeholder issues (Borgers et al., 2013; Derwall et al., 2011). On account of learning effects and changes in investor values, these issues came into focus in recent years and subsequently the CSP-CFP relation – in this case measured as market-based CFP – diminished considerably since the mid-2000s. However, in meta-research on the CSP-CFP link, the evidence of a time dependency is not consistent. In their meta-analysis, Pavie and Filho (2008) show considerable effect size differences before and after 1998. Some discover no or only non-significant relations (Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Rubera & Kirca, 2012). Based on suggestions from primary studies and meta-analyses, we hypothesize about the moderating role of time:\n\nH4a: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks over time.\n\n# Sample Size\n\nHedges (1981) demonstrates that effect sizes for small samples are biased upward. Evidence from cumulative meta-analyses in different fields supports this finding and cautions that meta-analyses with a small number of subjects may overestimate effects (Ioannidis, Trikalinos, Ntzani, & Contopoulos-Ioannidis, 2003; Trikalinos et al., 2004). By using the number of included studies as a weighting factor, the calculation design of meta-analyses seeks to adjust for this circumstance. If the CSP-CFP relation was a statistical outlier, we would observe effect size differences depending on the study sample size. Initial observations of our sample based on the number of included primary studies in a meta-analysis and the corresponding meta-study overall effect size support such a conclusion. We therefore hypothesize:\n\nH4b: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks with the growing number of primary studies in the meta-sample.\n\n# The Role of the Studies’ Publishing Source\n\nOrlitzky (2011) examines in a review of the 2003 data whether the empirical evidence on the CSP-CFP relation differs depending on the kind of publishing journal. The author finds that the average correlations in economics, finance, and accounting journals are less than half of the correlations published in social issues-oriented journals (SIM journals – social issues in management). The deviation is statistically significant. Allouche and Laroche (2005) reflect on their meta-analysis results by differentiating the publishing sources – business ethics journals, accounting journals, and management journals. They find no significant differences. In order to investigate the role of the publishing source for our sample, we follow a three-step approach. First, we differentiate between SIM and general management (GM) journals, similarly to Orlitzky (2011). Second, we classify the journals of our 25 meta-analyses according to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) classification standard [Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) subject categories]. Third, we take into consideration the JCR journal impact factor of the publishing journals for the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
