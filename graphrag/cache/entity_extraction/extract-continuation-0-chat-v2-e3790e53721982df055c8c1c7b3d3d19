To obtain the economic conditioning variables – the ZE1 in equation (4) – we again follow Vassalou (2003) and use macro variables known to predict equity returns. They are the risk-free rate (RF), the term premium (TERM) (the 10-year government bonds rate from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank minus the risk-free rate), and the default premium (DEF) (the yield difference between BAA and AAA bonds from the St. Louis Fed). We use the lagged average temperature over the past year (i.e., from t−12 to t−1) as the single climate control variable in ZC1.\n\nThe primary specification in Table 1 presents the construction and diagnostic tests of the tracking portfolios for the temperature shock factor based on equation (4) with the six Fama-French size-value portfolios as the basis assets and the macro variables used by Vassalou (2003) as conditioning variables. Because we use overlapping data, the t-ratios are obtained from Newey-West HAC standard errors with the bandwidth (lag parameter) set equal to 24.7.\n\nAll results are for 1953:5 - 2014:5 (we lose 1953:4 because we employ a one-month lagged term premium and our term premium data start in 1953:4. We also lose the 2014:6-2015:5 period which is required for the final sample point of T+12). The coefficient estimates in Panel A indicate that SL (small growth firms) and SH (small value firms) have significant tracking ability, positive and negative, respectively, for future temperature changes. The signs and significance of these coefficients are as expected: Growth firms may potentially benefit from temperature variation as they do not yet have their capital in place (SL coefficient > 0). Value firms face adjustment costs, as implied by Quiggin and Horowitz (2003), since their capital is already in place.\n\n7 The bandwidth exceeds the data overlap interval as suggested by Sun, Phillips, and Jin (2008). Following Bekaert and Hoerova (2014) we set the bandwidth equal to Max[3, 2*horizon] which is 24 in the case with annual horizon.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nplace· (SH· coefficient· <· 0).· The· impact· is· particularly· significant· for· small· companies· because· small· companies· generally· lack· resources· to· adapt· to· temperature· variation· (by,· for· instance,· relocating· production).· Conform· the· ability· of· larger· firms· to· adapt· more· easily· to· temperature· fluctuations,· the· portfolios· of· large· companies· show· no· significant· sensitivity· to· temperature· shocks.· The· chi-square· test· in· Panel· A· rejects· at· the· 5%· level· the· hypothesis· that· the· coefficients· on· the· basis· assets· are· jointly· zero,· indicating· that· these· assets· have· significant· tracking· ability.\n\nPanel· B· provides· the· mean· of· the· tracking· portfolio· return,· which· is· -0.02· percent· per· month· with· a· t-statistic· of· -4.26.· This· provides· direct· support· for· Hypothesis· 1,· that· the· risk· premium· on· temperature· variation· is· significantly· negative.· The· result· is· not· dependent· on· the· choice· of· a· particular· asset-pricing· model.· Figure· 1· shows· raw· average· temperatures· and· the· derived· temperature· shock· factor· series· (the· tracking· portfolio· returns)· from· 1953· through· 2014.\n\n# 3.2.
