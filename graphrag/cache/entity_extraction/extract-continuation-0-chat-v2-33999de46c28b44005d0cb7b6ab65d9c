Agency theory recognizes that board incentives to monitor on behalf of shareholders will vary, and board independence, in particular, is viewed as a key attribute in gauging monitoring incentives (Weisbach, 1988). Boards consisting mostly of insiders or dependent outside directors are expected to be less effective at monitoring than independent boards, whose incentives are not compromised through connection with the firm. Empirical evidence attempting to establish this supposed link through improved firm performance, however, is decidedly mixed (e.g. Aguilera, Desender, Bedar, & Lee, 2015; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand, & Johnson, 1998; Dalton, Hitt, Certo, & Dalton, 2007).\n\nThis line of inquiry has been extended to examine the role of board gender diversity in creating an effective monitoring environment. For example, in a sample of U.S. firms, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find that female directors have better attendance records than male directors, male directors have fewer attendance problems the more gender-diverse the board is, and women are more likely to join monitoring committees. They conclude that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. In addition, Schwartz-Ziv (2015) finds that boards that are more-gender-balanced (that is, have at least three directors of each gender) are more active than other boards, being more likely to request additional information and take initiative, such as proposing an action be taken. Others document associations between board gender diversity and a lower likelihood of earnings restatements and securities fraud (Abbott, Parker, & Presley, 2012; Cumming, Leung, & Rui, 2015), as well as higher.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n# Stock Price Informativeness and Earnings Quality\n\nWhile these findings suggest that board gender diversity appears to improve overall monitoring, evidence linking gender diversity to firm outcomes, especially firm performance, is more equivocal. For example, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find that CEO turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and that directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards, but that the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. Similarly mixed findings are reported by Carter, D'Souza, Simkins, & Simpson (2010), who report in their review of this literature that out of seven papers examining the link between gender diversity and firm performance, two find a positive relationship, three find no relationship, and two find a negative relationship.\n\nOverall, the agency theory perspective provides consistent evidence of improved monitoring from gender diverse boards, but has not established a clear link between that improved monitoring and firm performance.\n\n# Institutional Theory Perspectives\n\nInstitutional theory considers the processes by which structures, including schemas, rules, norms, and routines, become established as authoritative guidelines for social behavior. Within this framework, firms can be regarded as consisting of cognitive, normative, and regulative structures and activities that give meaning to social behavior. An important central assumption of this theory is that concerns regarding social legitimacy take precedence over those of economic efficiency or performance (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Scott, 2001).\n\nFrom an institutional theory perspective, firms’ pursuit of social legitimacy rather than shareholder wealth ultimately leads to organizational homogenization (or isomorphism) with regard to their most visible attributes, such as board composition. Board composition will thus be determined through the prevailing organizational norms in the field; i.e., boards.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nof organizations in the same institutional set will tend to be more similar to each other than to the boards of organizations outside of their set (Lynall, Golden, & Hillman, 2003). One such example of cross-country institutional isomorphism is the policy diffusion process that has taken place in Scandinavia and Europe with regard to mandating corporate board gender quotas, following Norway’s legal adoption of 40 percent quotas in 2004. A similar process occurred in the New Zealand Stock Exchange after the ASX changed its corporate governance guidelines in 2010, requiring listed companies to adopt and disclose their diversity policies (Payne & Phillips, 2014).\n\nAt the firm level, the quest for social legitimacy yields predictions for board composition. For example, prior research on organizational legitimacy implies that larger and more visible firms experience more pressure to conform to societal expectations and that elaborate relational networks among organizations and their members increase the need for greater social legitimacy (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). In addition, because having females on a corporate board can provide legitimacy in the eyes of firms’ potential and current employees, industries with a large female employment base are expected to have higher levels of female representation on boards of directors. Consistent with these predictions, Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella (2007) provide empirical evidence that larger firms and firms operating in industries with large female employment bases are significantly more likely to have at least one female board member. They also find that firms with female directors are more organizationally complex and have more directors who sit on other boards with female directors, consistent with predictions from institutional theory.\n\nThere is also evidence that greater gender diversity of corporate boards yields positive social legitimacy outcomes. For example, Bear, Rahman, & Post (2010) document that board gender diversity is positively associated with firms’ corporate social responsibility rankings and firm reputation as measured using Fortune Magazine’s “Most Admired Companies” list.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
