In addition, we find CSR exerts a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance.\n\nInterestingly, our meta-analysis demonstrates several unique findings on East Asian CSR practices which are different from Western countries. For instance, based on 52 Western background studies and a total sample size of 33,878 observations, Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta-analysis found that corporate environmental performance has a smaller relationship with corporate financial performance. While, our results diverge from Orlitzky et al. (2003) in that we find environmental CSR to have a stronger positive affect than social CSR on business performance in our East Asia samples. We suggest that the West/East divergence occurs because social CSR and environmental CSR have different importance in East Asia than they have in Western countries. While Western countries focus more on social CSR, during the past decade some East Asian developing regions, such as China, have been heavy manufacturers for the world, with the accompanying environmental pollution problems. That is, green signals (environmental CSR) are more attractive to East Asian stakeholders, while good signals (social CSR) are more attractive to Western stakeholders. Therefore, East Asian firms’ stakeholders are expressing more concerns about the natural environment, accounting for the focus on environmental CSR.\n\nMoreover, previous CSR literature seldom considered the role of contingencies such as institutional systems and culture. Our findings also confirm that economic development, firm size, organizational form, and measurement mode moderated CSR effects on business performance. These findings suggest that CSR is highly valued in East Asian developing countries, especially in China. Private firms rely more on CSR to obtain resources for enhanced competitiveness. Because scholars seldom explored the\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nIn the evolution of CSR’s value, we tried to investigate the evolutionary tendencies but failed to find significant results, which indicates that CSR practice were consistently important in East Asia over the past decade.\n\nIntriguingly, our Asian samples suggest that CSR has a stronger positive effect on performance for small firms than it has for large firms, in contrast to Marín et al. (2012) who argued that large firms in Spain are more visible to stakeholders and more likely to consider their demands. There are two reasons to explain this West/East divergence. One plausible reason for the difference may be the different development stage of CSR. In Western countries, CSR practices have been a pervasive and frequent activity during decades of development. Western companies, even the small ones, have the tradition to disclose CSR information to stakeholders. The differences of information asymmetry are not distinct between large firms and SMEs. But CSR in some East Asian regions is still in the beginning stages. CSR signals sending from small and private firm can attract numerous stakeholders’ attention. Another reason may be the different institutional environments. Institutional theory explains that institutional environments are crucial contingencies that can change the influence of institutions on firm performance. Because East Asia has an informal and weak institutional environment, East Asian SMEs would practice CSR to gain political ties with government and secure better protection. In general, we believe that firm size has a different moderating effect in the CSR–firm performance relationship in East Asian contexts than it has in Western countries.\n\nAlso, Marín et al. (2012) found that service and manufacturing industries experienced similar CSR effects. Our assumption that industry setting is a moderator was similarly rejected, overturning previous ideas that industry characteristics are potential determinants of CSR–business performance relationships (Reverte, 2009; Werther & Chandler, 2006). The reason that we failed to find the moderating role of industry setting is that both green signal and good signal are important to East Asian stakeholders. Collectively, this meta-analysis provides several valuable theoretical contributions and practical implications.\n\n# Theoretical contributions\n\nCombining signaling theory with institutional theory, we find sufficient reasons to support an overall positive association between CSR and business performance in East Asia as our baseline hypothesis. We make several contributions to research on CSR in East Asia in particular and to the field of business ethics as a whole. First, this meta-analysis expands the application of signaling theory and institutional theory. We try to apply signaling theory into the research of East Asian CSR practices, and argue that signaling theory is another powerful theoretical foundation that can explain the value of CSR. According to signaling theory, CSR signals can transfer information about firm’s unobserved attributes (e.g., CSR attitude and stakeholder influence capacity) to customers, suppliers, government, and other stakeholders. This information is crucial for stakeholders to evaluate the firm’s attitude towards environmental and social issues. Especially, CSR practice signals can help firms obtain a premium from stakeholders and sometimes make up the institution deficiency in China and other East Asian emerging economies (Surroca et al., 2010). The viewpoint and results of this study are consistent with former research findings. Previous studies agree that CSR actives are a kind of organizational strategic investment to build close connection with diverse stakeholders and acquire their support. Firm with better social performance can acquire.\n\nM. Hou et al.\n\nMore intangible resources, including organizational culture, reputation, and human resources that give them competitive advantage (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Different from above viewpoints related to stakeholder theory and the resource-based view, our signaling perspective emphasizes the signaling role of CSR practices in dealing with information asymmetry. Specifically, by integrating empirical results across 28 empirical studies, we make conclusions about the overall value of CSR in driving business performance in East Asia. We show that CSR is, indeed, a valuable business strategy in the East Asian context. Moreover, our meta-analysis reveals that environmental CSR has a stronger positive effect on firm performance than\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>GEO<|>East Asia is a region that has unique CSR practices and challenges, particularly in relation to environmental and social responsibilities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a significant player in East Asia, known for its manufacturing and environmental pollution issues, influencing CSR practices in the region.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on the world, particularly in East Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>M.
