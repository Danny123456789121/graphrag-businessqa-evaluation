Generative AI tools makes it difficult for educators, particularly those at research-oriented institutions, to confirm the novelty of the work that students submit. For example, if the output of generative AI tools goes unnoticed by standard plagiarism detection systems used universities,79 how can it be confirmed a particular paper or essay represents the student’s original work rather than just the product of generative AI?\n\nOne of the significant challenges includes potential bias in data and algorithms, which could inadvertently shape learning outcomes and perceptions. Moreover, a lack of transparency surrounding AI-driven processes might create a barrier to trust and acceptance among users.80 The use of generative AI in education also raises ethical and safety issues as it can infringe upon the privacy of students. If the tool isn’t adequately protected, it could be leveraged to gather confidential information.\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Table 3. Generative AI opportunities in education.\n\n|Theme|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Personalized feedback|Generative AI can oﬀer individualized feedback on assignments, pinpointing strengths and suggesting areas of improvement. This approach promotes targeted growth and motivation as well as enhances the learning experience. Customized educational strategies and pedagogical resources may be systematically developed by considering students’ diverse learning modalities and capacities.|\n|Virtual interactive tutor|Generative AI can be used to create virtual tutors that can answer students’ queries and provide them with appropriate feedback. This helps provide real-time explanations and responses to student queries as well as facilitate continuous learning support beyond traditional classroom hours. Virtual tutors can also help in language learning. For instance, a virtual tutor can deliver tailored responses and facilitate dialogic exercises for individuals acquiring a new language. An exceptionally individualized learning environment can be provided as such a tutor can dynamically adjust to the learner’s proﬁciency and speed of learning. This approach is advantageous for learners with limited access to human language tutors or those who favor self-paced learning by accommodating to their personalized timetables.|\n|Easy access to information|Generative AI can facilitate student access to information across diverse platforms (e.g., websites, mobile applications) and within various domains. Compared to conventional search engine tools, generative AI exhibits enhanced eﬃciency as it does not merely proﬀer a sequence of sources but comprehensively articulated responses. Pedagogically, this implies that generative AI can curtail the temporal investment required for information retrieval which would allow students additional time for reading and engaging in critical introspection of the presented document.|\n|Generating case scenarios|Generative AI can create a myriad of illustrative case studies and scenarios which would facilitate student engagement and cognitive progression. This approach holds promise in its ability to nurture critical thinking capacities among students. Moreover, it could help students transition their theoretical knowledge into practical application by eﬀectively equipping them with the competencies to address real-world challenges.|\n|Research assistance|Generative AI can potentially be deployed as an assistance tool in academic pursuits by facilitating responses to queries and producing summaries of extensive texts. Moreover, it can be instrumental in creating bibliographies, delineating outlines, and providing supplementary research aids. The conveniences in the research process can be signiﬁcantly augmented by the capabilities of generative AI in structuring outlines, aiding in literature surveys, and analyzing data. In addition, it can condense pertinent scholarly articles and pinpoint crucial results which will enhance the eﬃciency of researchers in sifting through the abundant amount of data accessible in the digital realm.|\n|Academic writing|Generative AI can enhance students’ essay writing by oﬀering topic suggestions, proposing structural frameworks, contributing intellectual stimuli, and augmenting their scholarly written discourse. For instance, when a student requires assistance in composing an essay entitled “The Role of Robotics in Education”, these tools can render propositions for declarative statements and prospective subjects for the main body sections. This assistance empowers students to amalgamate their cognitions and perspectives to culminate in a comprehensive piece of writing. Nevertheless, students’ ability to engage in critical reasoning remains paramount in verifying the accuracy and correctness of the composed narrative.|\n\nThe transactional distance is another dimension that comes into play with the advent of generative AI in education, particularly in terms of distance education and online learning. This term refers to the psychological and communicative distance between learners and educators which can hinder effective learning. While generative AI has the potential to diminish this transactional distance by offering personalized learning experiences, the educators’ role remains paramount. This is because they are tasked with bridging this gap, providing personalized support, and guidance throughout the learning process. This role is not limited to pedagogical aspects as it also extends to encompass the pedagogy of care and human-centered learning design.\n\nGenerative AI tools might offer constrained information. ChatGPT, for instance, is only equipped with data up to 2021. This constraint can lead to knowledge deficiencies and outdated information if the tool misreads command. These limitations would contribute to incorrect or inaccurate responses as knowledge continues to progress. For instance, if asked to incorporate recent references, the tool might invent seemingly valid ones that don’t refer to actual sources. The effectiveness of generative AI is also contingent on data quality. If the training data is of poor quality, the tool’s responses might be imprecise and untrustworthy. Furthermore, generative AI may not deeply comprehend the meanings of the words it handles. It identifies patterns and crafts plausible replies but might not fully understand the underlying notions of the words. This could lead to responses that occasionally lack depth and discernment and possibly deviate from the topic, especially when tasked with activities demanding a subtle grasp of specific domain knowledge.\n\n# Research agenda\n\nThe following RQs provide a road map for future research on generative AI in education:\n\n- How do generative AI tools promote educational\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication focused on computer information systems, discussing various topics including the impact of generative AI in education.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate text, images, or other media based on input data, significantly impacting educational practices and methodologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a generative AI tool developed by OpenAI, designed to assist users by generating human-like text based on prompts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDUCATORS<|>PERSON<|>Educators are individuals who facilitate learning, providing guidance and support to students in various educational settings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUDENTS<|>PERSON<|>Students are individuals engaged in learning, often in academic institutions, who may utilize generative AI tools for their studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH-ORIENTED INSTITUTIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research-oriented institutions are educational establishments focused on conducting research and advancing knowledge in various fields.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EDUCATORS<|>Generative AI tools are used by educators to enhance teaching methods and provide personalized learning experiences<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>STUDENTS<|>Students utilize generative AI tools to assist with their assignments and improve their learning outcomes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>STUDENTS<|>Students use ChatGPT to generate text and receive feedback on their writing assignments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The journal discusses the implications and applications of generative AI in educational contexts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCH-ORIENTED INSTITUTIONS<|>EDUCATORS<|>Educators at research-oriented institutions are involved in exploring the impact of generative AI on academic integrity and learning outcomes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCH-ORIENTED INSTITUTIONS<|>STUDENTS<|>Students at research-oriented institutions may face challenges related to the use of generative AI in their academic work<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
