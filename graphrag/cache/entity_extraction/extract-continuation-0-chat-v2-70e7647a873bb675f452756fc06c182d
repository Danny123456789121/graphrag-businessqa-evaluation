A number of moderators have been considered by existing studies, including firm size, industry effects, advertising intensity, R&D spending, past financial performance, or public ownership (Balabanis et al. 1998; Lev et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2015).\n\nBefore taking a closer look at the mentioned control variables individually, it is an interesting question as to whether the overall relationship between CP and subsequent CFP changes if only partial correlations are considered. A number of studies have already included control variables into their measurements, but their results cannot readily be mixed with bivariate effect sizes, so these are investigated as a separate sample within our study. Based on the arguments made above, a significant correlation is still expected when the effects of other variables are partialed out and the ‘true’ relationship is measured.\n\n# RQ4a: Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations in general?\n\nBesides the integration of all partial correlation coefficients controlling for different sets of control variables, these can also be analyzed separately. For example, numerous studies controlled for firm size, which has an effect on public visibility and is, thus, suggested to influence the CP–CFP relationship (Balabanis et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2015; Iatridis 2015). Furthermore, within distinct industries, different levels of CP or profitability are common and shareholder returns vary, which is why industry effects should be controlled for (Seifert et al. 2004).\n\nAdvertising is an important way to create intangible assets, such as firm reputation or brand identification. As these can have a considerable impact on future firm performance and at the same time are associated with CP, advertising intensity is an important variable to be taken into consideration when evaluating CP business impacts (Wang et al. 2008). Furthermore, Wang and Qian (2011) argue that stakeholders are unlikely to respond positively to the CP activities of companies if these failed to fulfill their basic financial needs in the past. The past financial performance, hence, influences the impact of CP on future CFP and should be considered as a control variable. Another important moderating variable is public ownership. Especially in China, where many firms are partly owned by the state, it is argued that private firms need to be more strategic in directing their donations to generate public goodwill (Zhang et al. 2010; Qiu 2013).\n\n# F. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\narguments, all of the mentioned variables are expected to have a significant impact on the relationship. Consequently, it should be examined whether the relationship holds for subgroups of studies that controlled for the respective moderators.\n\n# RQ4b:\n\nDoes the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for firm size?\n\n# RQ4c:\n\nDoes the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for industry?\n\n# RQ4d:\n\nDoes the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for advertising intensity?\n\n# RQ4e:\n\nDoes the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for past CFP?\n\n# RQ4f:\n\nDoes the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for public ownership?\n\n# 3 Method\n\n# 3.1 Sample\n\nTo find studies on the topic of CP, we used the search words (corpor* OR company* OR business OR enterprise* OR firm*) AND (donat* OR philanthrop* OR “charitable giving” OR volunteer*). Additionally, wherever possible, we employed the complementary search terms (data OR empirical OR test OR statistical OR finding* OR result* OR evidence) to narrow down the search results to quantitative studies (David and Han 2004). This search equation was applied to scan the databases Emerald Insight and ScienceDirect as well as a number of other databases, namely Academic Source Complete, Business Source Complete, EconLit with Full Text, E-Journals, and GreenFILE, which were accessed through the host platform EBSCOhost®. From the database result lists, only the articles or books which had conducted quantitative empirical analyses about the relationship between CP and CFP were included in the sample. The database research for literature was completed by the end of May 2015. Furthermore, the authors of recently conducted literature reviews (Liket and Simaens 2015; Gautier and Pache 2015) were contacted and kindly provided support in contributing additional articles to the final sample. Including cross references identified within the found literature, an initial dataset of 69 publications was selected for further analysis.\n\nTo be included in the final sample of studies used for the meta-analysis, the studies had to report empirical results that were convertible into r correlation coefficients with the help of respective transformation formulas (Greene 2000; Lipsey and Wilson 2001; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001). Furthermore, as recommended by Dalton and Dalton (2005), correlations had to rely on a sample size of at least 30 to be included into the meta-analysis. In case of incomplete data (e.g. no sample size reported), studies were removed from the sample. After applying these selection criteria, a final sample of 45 publications provided the database for this study. Observations and reported results of the relevant empirical analyses were distinguished according to the employed sample, statistical relationship (i.e. bivariate or partial), applied time lag, and operationalization.\n\n# 3.2 Coding and integration of effect sizes\n\nBesides the captured information regarding effect size statistic and sample size, each effect size result was coded for the study design factors outlined in the “Theoretical background” section.
