CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nAs with any new technology, AI may have open ended effects on HRM, the study of the same, and indeed, economy and society at large. Although it has clear potential to be beneficial, its full consequences are unknown. Indeed, the jury is out if genuine AI exists at the present time at all; however, even sophisticated sets of data compilation and problem-solving algorithms may pose great opportunities and risks. At HRMJ, we are seeking to promote greater understanding and debate around AI and its effects on the study and practice of HRM; the different thematic presentations in this HRMJ perspectives editorial do not provide a single set of definitive solutions or judgements, but rather a starting point on this journey of discovery.\n\n# AFFILIATIONS\n\n|1|Aston University, Birmingham, UK|\n|---|---|\n|2|Information, Operations and Management Sciences Department, TBS Business School, Toulouse, France|\n|3|DAN Department of Management & Organizational Studies, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada|\n|4|Cranfield University, Bedford, UK|\n|5|University of Bath, Claver Down, UK|\n\n# 46\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\n6Trinity Business School, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland\n\n7School of Business, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA\n\n8Monash Data Futures Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia\n\n9Department of Human Resources & Organizational Behavior, School of Business, Rutgers University-Camden, Camden, New Jersey, USA\n\n10Human Resource Studies, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands\n\n11Utrecht University School of Governance, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands\n\n12Monash Business School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia\n\n13Department of Strategy & International Business, Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK\n\n14Tulane University, A.B.
