However, while the results of studies based on portfolio analyses and multivariate analyses have been captured by the above-mentioned meta-analyses, thus far no attempt has been made towards an integration and consolidation of the empirical evidence provided by event studies.\n\n1 In addition, there are several meta-analyses regarding the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP (e.g., Allouche and Laroche 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). As CEP can be considered a dimension or a component of the broader construct of CSP (e.g., Busch and Hoffmann 2011; Orlitzky et al. 2003), the CSP–CFP meta-analyses partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis.\n\nIn an effort to remedy this deficiency, this paper provides a meta-analysis that accumulates 53 effect sizes derived from 32 studies concerned with stock market reactions to CEP-related events. Meta-analysis, a tool for quantitatively synthesizing the findings across a number of studies, has become increasingly common in management research (Combs et al. 2011; Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012). Particularly in cases where inconsistent findings impede any generalizations, it has become the methodology of choice for establishing consensus (Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012).\n\nThe current study makes three contributions. First, it contributes to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by complementing the existing CEP–CFP meta-analyses and thus completing the body of cumulative evidence regarding the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, given the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytically derived significant population effect would provide a rather clear indication of an impact of CEP on CFP ruling out potential reverse causality. This is of particular importance because the direction of causality (i.e., whether causation runs from CEP to CFP or vice versa) still represents a disputed issue (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Molina-Azorín et al. 2009; Nakao et al. 2007). Second, picking up anecdotal evidence, which suggests stronger market reactions to negative events compared with positive ones, this work offers theoretical reasoning for this phenomenon and incorporates this issue in the meta-analytic investigation. Finally, by conducting exploratory moderator analyses (Geyskens et al. 2006; Kirca et al. 2012), this article examines potential moderation effects arising from methodological artifacts such as different study design and sample characteristics.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, the theoretical background is presented from which the hypotheses are derived. Second, the data as well as the methodology employed are explained. The presentation of the results of the analyses follows. Finally, the findings are discussed and important implications highlighted.\n\n# Background and Development of Hypotheses\n\n# CEP-Related Events and the Link between CEP and CFP\n\nThe event study methodology was developed in finance (e.g., Brown and Warner 1985) and has been widely applied in management research (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Event studies examine whether there are abnormal stock price effects due to announcements of unanticipated events or changes with regard to managerial decisions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999). The crucial assumption underlying event studies refers to the efficient\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\nMarket hypothesis, which proposes that markets are able to anticipate and correctly interpret relevant news and quickly adjust security prices (Fama 1991; Frooman 1997). While it is commonly known that stock markets are not information perfect, they are considered to work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy by continually assessing and valuing new information (Frooman 1997; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). Therefore, in cases of major events, abnormal returns (ARs) or cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) (i.e., significantly greater positive or negative returns) that accrue for the particular firm allow inferring that the event significantly influences the value of the firm (Frooman 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999).\n\nThe earliest event study examining ARs as consequence of CEP-related events, to the best knowledge of the author, was provided by Shane and Spicer (1983). They examined how the stock market reacted to releases of pollution control reports by the Council on Economic Priorities and found relatively large negative ARs especially for firms with low pollution control performance. Another prominent example is the study of Klassen and McLaughlin (1996), who analyzed the market reactions to (1) third-party announcements of environmental awards signaling superior CEP and to (2) environmental crises (e.g., oil spills) signaling weak CEP. They found significant positive returns for firms receiving an environmental award and significant negative returns for firms involved in an environmental crisis. While the majority of earlier studies focused on the US and usually examined announcements associated with pollution information, in recent times several event studies have been conducted in other institutional settings (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012) and incorporated a broader range of CEP-related events. For example, Gilley et al. (2000) provided an event study focusing on the announcement of product- and process-driven environmental initiatives. While they found no overall effect of such announcements on stock returns, the results of their study suggest differences in the market reaction with regard to the specific type of the environmental initiative announced. In particular, the stock market reacted more positively to product-driven initiatives compared to process\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
