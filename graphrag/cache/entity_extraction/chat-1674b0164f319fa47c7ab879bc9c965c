Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008) indicated that the findings on the effects external to firms on the achievement of competitive advantages based on environmental capabilities have important implications for future research in both environmental management strategy and the study of industrial agglomerations and geographic clusters. This is because clusters reveal that the business environment outside companies also plays a vital role in their performance (Porter, 1998). The cluster analysis (Fig. 8) has the same indication; that is, collaboration is a new subject, and the OCS could be studied in the context of networks.\n\nAnother alternative is related to the development of studies within the context of multinational companies, since only two studies had this focus: Chakrabarty and Wang (2012) and Pinkse et al. (2010). Such studies may produce interesting results because, depending on the location/country where the multinationals are located, comparative analyses can be done since aspects for the development of OCSs can be facilitated or made difficult by local characteristics such as culture, access to specialized labor, local development etc. OCSs can also be influenced by the location of companies. For example, in some regions, customers are more aware and more easily influenced to take sustainability issues into account in the consumption of goods and services, and pressures for environmental certifications, for example, are higher than in other regions. This can be captured and compared by studying multinationals.\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\n# Countries\n\nSince most of the studies carried out empirical studies in countries with advanced economies, there is an opportunity for research in developing countries and in different countries. This research opportunity was also analyzed by Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019), who both had developed SLR with research themes related to this article. Therefore, it will be possible the development of comparative analyses on how aspects of the local context, such as economy and culture, influence the development of OCSs, as well as the expected CSB.\n\n# OCSs and expected corporate sustainability benefits\n\nAs can be seen in Table 3, research on OCS and consequently on CSB has increased over the years and can be considered quite relevant in the current context. Studies focusing on OCS6 and OCS7 are still necessary, since they received less attention by the researchers in the sample. Regarding CSBs (Table 4), several OCSs are related to the same groups of expected benefits. However, some of them are unrelated, as can be seen in the Table 4, and therefore means future research opportunities.\n\nFinally, from the research opportunities, it was possible to elaborate Fig. 10, which synthesizes the research agenda presented here. All relationships between OCSs and CBSs that have not yet been studied are identified by arrows between the first two columns. For all proposed relationships, there are opportunities for methods (column 3), geographical contexts (column 4) and, finally, countries (column 5).\n\n# Fig. 10.

Conclusions, contributions, limitations and future research\n\nThis research systematized the available knowledge on strategic OCS. Therefore, this paper performs an SLR by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, it was possible to identify CSB from the OCS and propose an integrative framework linking both.\n\n# 6.1. Contributions for theory and practice\n\nThis paper presents relevant contributions. The main contribution is the proposed framework (Fig. 9) that relates to OCSs (Table 2, Table 3, and Fig. 9) and CSBs (Table 4). The framework is relevant as it identifies and categorizes OCSs and CSBs that companies can acquire by developing and improving those OC. OCSs and CSBs have been studied over the years by a large number of authors, but no survey so far has been proposed to map the studies through an analysis of all existing literature. Based on this, we develop a framework that synthesizes all the OC developed by the companies (internal).\n\nand external) and the sustainability benefits tied to those capabilities. This is the great contribution of this article.\n\nBased on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature. The OCS1 is the most relevant in the analyzed sample of articles. The OCS6 and OCS7 were the ones with the lowest number of articles, providing indications that still need further investigation.
