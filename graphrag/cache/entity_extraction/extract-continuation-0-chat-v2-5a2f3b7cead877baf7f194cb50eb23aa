Sustainable products and services can address the needs of sustainability-oriented consumers and, therefore, help a company gain a selective advantage over its competitors. For instance, higher prices may be charged in customer segments such as LOHAS (lifestyle of health and sustainability) (Aburdene, 2007):\n\n# Proposition 2d\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased market differentiation.\n\n# Example 2d\n\nToyota’s introduction of its hybrid car “Prius” in the US is one example. In general, at the operational level, companies also need to critically analyze services and products offered, the related turnover and market developments over a certain period of time in order to better understand whether sustainability management has led to increased market performance.\n\nOne important aspect to consider when providing sustainable products and services is the minimization of negative environmental impacts throughout their lifecycle. This is often associated with the ‘dematerialization’ of a product or service, which can lead to product-service systems (Roy, 2000; Mont, 2002; Tukker, 2004; Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Gelbmann and Hammerl, 2014). The resulting systems tend to be characterized by the fact that the need for a ‘product’ as a service, rather than the product or service itself, is the selling point.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nfor customers. In such cases, customers no longer wish to buy a product, they merely wish to pay for the use or service the ‘product’ delivers.\n\n# Proposition 2e:\n\nThe change from classical product-selling business models to product-service systems can significantly reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of a product.\n\n# Example 2e:\n\nProduct life cycle analyses are used to reveal the impact of a product on the environment and illustrate which respective actors are responsible for various impacts (producer, consumer, or disposer). This helps introduce changes into the business model (although potential rebound effects also need to be considered) where the economic rationale supports selling services, rather than only products.\n\nA business model describes how a company delivers products and services to customers and how revenues are generated (Zott al., 2011, Boons and Lüdeke-Freund, 2013). In proposition 2e, the number of services sold within the product-service system, rather than the number of products sold, determines economic success. This represents a new type of business model. Another example is related to the creation of a stakeholder value as opposed to a shareholder value (i.e., an essential element of second-order sustainability performance). Such arrangements are often referred to as “sustainable” or “green” business models (Bocken et al., 2014; Rauter et al., 2015).\n\n# Proposition 2f:\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on the development of new business models.\n\n# Example 2f:\n\nLooking for ways to increase corporate environmental and social performance can provide an impulse to redesign the current business model and/or develop a new business model. This is done in the textile industry when companies fully restructure their supply chains, taking sustainability issues into account (e.g., Rauter et al., 2015).\n\nCapturing the potential business value that will be derived from corporate sustainability management is only possible when relevant opportunities are identified. To do this, the various aspects of sustainability need to be integrated into the ‘context dimension’. The business value gained in a narrow sense is based on the ability to reduce costs and increase profits. In the broader sense, benefits are based on improved competitiveness, improved innovation capacity and the introduction of new business models.\n\n# 4 Developing and initiating a sustainable organization – the process dimension of sustainable strategic management\n\nWhile sections 3.1 and 3.2 dealt with strategy content and strategy context, this section focuses on strategy process. The strategy process concerns the\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nConstruction and development of strategy (i.e., the ‘how’, ‘who’ and ‘when’ of strategy formation) (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). In terms of corporate sustainability management, the strategy process must ensure that sustainability issues are integrated across all relevant corporate levels and systems such that the resulting business and societal values may be adequately captured. This means that sustainability issues are integrated into the organizational culture, the strategic goal setting, learning and feedback loops and into the daily activities of the company.\n\nThree management levels can be distinguished (Ulrich, 2001), which are also relevant for corporate sustainability management (Baumgartner, 2014): the normative, strategic and operational levels. The normative level encompasses the basic management philosophy: the values, attitudes, beliefs and judgments, which together make up the organizational culture. This culture provides the basis for managing the organization (Baumgartner and Zielowski, 2007; Baumgartner, 2009; Linnenluecke and Griffith, 2009). The normative level guides issues that are related to the question “Who are we and who do we want to be?” This leads to the following proposition that refers to the normative level:\n\n# Proposition 3a\n\nThe organizational culture has a strong influence on the different steps necessary in the development towards a ‘sustainable organization’. The higher the level of sustainability awareness within an organization, the more ambitious the goals and strategies deployed when pursuing sustainable development.\n\n# Example 3a\n\nBaumgartner (2009) provides the example of a global mining company in order to illustrate the relationships between basic values, assumptions and strategic orientation.\n\nLong-term goals and product/service-market combinations are defined at\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TOYOTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toyota is a multinational automotive manufacturer known for its innovative hybrid vehicles, including the Prius, which was introduced in the US market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIUS<|>EVENT<|>The Prius is a hybrid car model introduced by Toyota, representing a significant step towards sustainable automotive technology.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOHAS<|>PERSON<|>LOHAS stands for Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability, a consumer segment that prioritizes sustainable and health-conscious products.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAUMGARTNER<|>PERSON<|>Baumgartner is a researcher who has contributed to the understanding of corporate sustainability management and its impact on organizational culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sustainability management refers to the processes and practices that organizations implement to minimize their environmental impact and promote social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEMS<|>EVENT<|>Product-service systems are business models that focus on providing services rather than selling products, aimed at reducing environmental impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability involves strategies and practices that aim to create long-term stakeholder value by considering environmental, social, and economic impacts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOYOTA<|>PRIUS<|>Toyota introduced the Prius as a hybrid vehicle to promote sustainability in the automotive industry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOHAS<|>SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>LOHAS consumers drive the demand for sustainability management practices in organizations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAUMGARTNER<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Baumgartner's research focuses on corporate sustainability and its integration into organizational culture<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEMS<|>Sustainability management often leads to the adoption of product-service systems to minimize environmental impacts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Corporate sustainability is a key aspect of sustainability management practices within organizations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
