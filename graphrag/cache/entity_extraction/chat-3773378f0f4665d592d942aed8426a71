The literature is organized using the multi-level framework originally proposed by Coleman (1986) and refined by Hedström and Swedberg (1998). The analysis of existing literature problematises key assumptions SMA research has adopted from conventional management accounting. It proposes a new Context, Action, Transformation (CAT) framework for SMA research and practice and suggests a new assumption on scope be adopted in future SMA research.\n\n|Table 1: Agreed Search Strings|Table 1: Agreed Search Strings|Table 1: Agreed Search Strings|\n|---|\n|Group 1|Group 2|Search Strings|\n|Environmental|Social|Sustainability Accounting|\n\nFive commonly used databases (EBSCO Host-Business Source Premier (BSP); JSTOR; ScienceDirect; Scopus and Web of Science) were selected as different databases can lead to different themes.\n\n# Search strings for the systematic review\n\n# Group 1: Terms referring to SMA\n\n|Carbon accounting|Sustainable cost management|\n|---|---|\n|Water accounting|Environmental cost management|\n|Material flow accounting|Social cost management|\n|Material flow cost accounting (MFCA)|Sustainability benchmarking|\n|Biodiversity accounting|Environmental benchmarking|\n|Social accounting|Sustainability budgeting|\n|Environmental accounting|Environmental budgeting|\n|Environmental management accounting|Social budgeting|\n|Sustainability accounting|Sustainability key performance indicators|\n|Sustainability management accounting|Environmental key performance indicators|\n|Ecological accounting|Social key performance indicators|\n|GHG accounting|Sustainability performance management|\n|Greenhouse gas accounting|Environmental performance management|\n|Energy accounting|Social performance management|\n|Environmental management control|Sustainable product design indicators|\n|Social management control|Environmental product design indicators|\n|Sustainability management control|Social product design indicators|\n|Sustainability control|Sustainability investment appraisal|\n|Eco control|Environmental investment appraisal|\n|Sustainability balanced scorecard|Social investment appraisal|\n|Environmental balanced scorecard|Accounting for stakeholder|\n|Social balanced scorecard|Accounting for human right|\n|Sustainable decision-making|Accounting for modern slavery|\n|Environmental decision-making| |\n|Social decision-making| |\n\nNote: Each term in Group 1 is matched in turn with each term in Group 2 to capture combinations of terms in sustainability management accounting.\n\n(Meho & Yang, 2007). Table 2 shows the search yielded 5456 articles to the end of 2019. The final number of articles for analysis, after data cleaning (as described) and adjustments, was 62 high quality peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\nThe goal was to include reviewed articles that address multi-level linkages with SMA. In the analysis of title and abstract, articles which only mention SMA issues at the margin, such as those dealing with broader corporate social responsibility issues, external communication, reporting and disclosure of sustainability aspects, were excluded. Furthermore, with the focus on for-profit companies, articles were excluded that examine an entire economy, local or regional areas, governments, municipalities, non-profits and public sectors. Likewise, articles dealing with sustainability accounting from an engineering perspective focusing on technical analysis or on different forms of sustainability accounting for ecosystems, forests or other natural habitats, were excluded to ensure a clear focus for the study.\n\nIntercoder agreement on the exclusion criteria was assessed using the Krippendorff α (Krippendorff, 2013; Lombard et al., 2002) based on a SPSS macro by Hayes and Krippendorff (2007). All four authors reviewed 30 randomly chosen articles and rated whether they should be included in the sample based on the exclusion criteria given above. The results were discussed to achieve agreement and then new sets of randomly chosen articles were rated until agreement by all authors was reached at the threshold of Krippendorff.\n\n# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\n\n# Table 2\n\n# Derivation of publications included in the review\n\n|Database From origin to end 2019|EBSCO – BSP|JSTOR|Direct|Scopus|Science|Total number|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|First scan – citations|1687|37|543|2207|982|5456|\n|Data cleaning.
