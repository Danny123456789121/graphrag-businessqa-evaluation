Using meta-analytic structural equation modeling on effect size data from 344 primary studies, our study documents four empirical mechanisms explaining how CSR positively affects CFP: by 1) enhancing firm reputation, 2) increasing stakeholder reciprocation, 3) mitigating firm risk, and 4) strengthening innovation capacity. We propose these four mechanisms to identify four causally relevant attributes that allow us to conceptually distinguish Strategic CSR from CSR more generally. Our findings indicate that this article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nthat the four mechanisms combined explain 20 percent of the CSR-CFP relationship, suggesting that considerable room remains for future empirical research. The development of an empirically informed, causal conceptualization of Strategic CSR responds to a long-heard call for better-specified concepts in empirical CSR research.\n\nKeywords: Concept Formation, Corporate Social Responsibility, Financial Performance, Meta-Analysis, Strategy.\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nThe concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has inspired empirical research in management for almost half a century (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012). Early empirical CSR research initially had the (often only implicit) ambition of showing that the socially beneficial activities denoted by the CSR concept could be strategically justified by their positive performance implications for the firms undertaking them (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995). Orlitzky and colleagues (2003) synthesized the findings of 52 primary studies on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) produced in these early years. By documenting a small positive association between CSR and CFP, they corroborated that CSR can indeed be justified strategically.\n\nOver the last two decades, however, CSR research has shifted its focus from investigating the CSR-CFP relationship as a whole to identifying the concrete empirical mechanisms through which CSR activities affect firm-level financial outcomes. This shift seems to have been motivated by three reasons. First, the documentation of a small positive relationship between CSR and CFP by Orlitzky and colleagues (2003) obviated the justificatory ambition to show that CSR mattered, thereby making room for the explanatory question of how CSR mattered instead (Barnett, 2007; Wang, Tong, & Takeuchi, 2016).\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nSecond, scholars became increasingly critical of the coarse-grained and over-inclusive approach to conceptualizing CSR, which produced a concept referring to a diverse set of empirical phenomena (Gond & Crane, 2010). As a response, finer-grained research was increasingly undertaken, focusing on specific types of CSR activities and their indirect effect on firm performance (Flammer, 2013; King & Lenox, 2002; Wang & Qian, 2011). Third, CSR research became methodologically more sophisticated as scholars started to use more advanced research designs (Flammer, 2013, 2015; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016), better data (Henisz, Dorobantu, & Nartey, 2014; Lev, Petrovits, & Radhakrishnan, 2010; Zhao & Murrell, 2016), and more rigorous analytical techniques (Cheng, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Surroca, Tribó, & Waddock, 2010), that required a shift towards more focused research questions (Godfrey, Merril, & Hansen, 2009; Koh, Qian, & Wang, 2014; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016).\n\nAs individual CSR-CFP studies became finer-grained and more focused, however, the field as a whole became more fragmented. A diverse and growing body of empirical findings has emerged identifying a wide variety of empirical mechanisms linking CSR to CFP.
