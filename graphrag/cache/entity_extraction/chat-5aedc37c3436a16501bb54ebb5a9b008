To develop these responses, they refer to existing solutions that have been successfully applied to similarly interpreted issues (Ocasio, 1997): they “access common solutions when faced with common situations that are clearly positive or negative” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). Being based on incremental adaptations of routine response patterns to positive or negative business issues, the responses these managers consider will be limited in scope. This narrow focus on business routines will enable decision makers to simplify complex sustainability issues (Porac & Rosa, 1996) and to come up with swift responses once they have evaluated an issue as being relevant for economic objectives (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).\n\nThe search for responses to sustainability issues that are in the vicinity of existing solutions also reduces the perceived riskiness and novelty of these responses (Plambeck & Weber,\n\n2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 477\n\nWith their high sense of control based on formalized search and assessment routines, as well as existing solutions (George et al., 2006), decision makers with a business case frame tend to underestimate the risk of the responses to sustainability issues that they consider. By relying on established routines to ascertain the profitability of environmental and social investments, such as formal investment appraisal procedures (Epstein & Roy, 2003), and by referring to known solutions, such as incremental improvements of existing technologies (Hart, 1995), they strongly believe in their ability to handle and control risk (Das & Teng, 1999). The higher their sense of control, not only the lower the perceived risk but also the greater the likelihood that risk will be underestimated and the more optimistic the forecasts managers will make about the outcomes of their responses to an issue (Durand, 2003; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Consequently, these decision makers will be willing to consider investments of considerable magnitude as long as these do not entail radical departures from established routines but rely on skills and solutions, which they perceive they are able to master.\n\nWhen responding to regulatory pressure in the European Union for lower carbon emissions during the 2000s, top management of carmaker Volkswagen followed a pragmatic stance and developed the BlueMotion line of more fuel-efficient cars based on incremental improvements of its trusted diesel technology (Financial Times, 2007). This stance, however, came at the expense of developing alternative propulsion systems, such as electric vehicles, that required a departure from existing technologies. At the same time, the BlueMotion line was deployed swiftly across the entire model range, resulting in a large-scale response. Even if this reliance on incremental improvements of conventional technology was probably insufficient to meet more stringent emission regulations in the future, Volkswagen management seemed confident in its focus on responses with limited scope but high controllability (Financial Times, 2011).\n\nOverall, we expect that holding a business case frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by pragmatism. With this stance decision makers prefer “workable” solutions to sustainability issues based on strategies that remain within existing technological systems, producing as little disruption as possible (Prasad & Elmes, 2005). On the one hand, such a stance is rather parochial, since managers only consider responding to those aspects of a sustainability issue for which they perceive immediate business relevance; they will discard other aspects and fail to develop a comprehensive perspective of the issue. On the other hand, their focus on workable solutions is more likely to lead to concrete measures and responses that are actually implemented, thus “proposing working solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems” (Prasad & Elmes, 2005: 850).\n\nProposition 7a: The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues.\n\nBuilding on their broad but less detailed scanning on a wide range of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame experience a moderate sense of control and develop ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that integrate positive as well as negative evaluations with regard to economic, environmental, and social outcomes. This ambivalence simultaneously activates response patterns for approaching positive and avoiding negative aspects (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Plambeck & Weber, 2009). Managers will consider not only environmental and social aspects that provide financial benefits but also aspects where such benefits are unclear, or even unlikely. Their cognitive ability to accommodate conflicting aspects enables them to consider responses with a broader scope that are internally consistent, but “may be inconsistent or contradictory across [responses]” (Smith, Binns, & Tushman, 2010: 449). However, the higher cognitive complexity associated with ambivalence impedes swift responses (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996), since decision makers take more time to assess and integrate more diverse and potentially competing aspects of a sustainability issue (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).\n\nBecause ambivalence activates a broad set of positive as well as negative evaluations of a sustainability issue simultaneously, managers with a paradoxical frame tend to perceive issues as unique. Consequently, they feel that these issues cannot be adequately addressed through existing solutions and routines, and this\n\ntriggers a search for alternative responses (March & Simon, 1958). During the search for alternative responses, the activation of different response patterns increases the “likelihood of finding multiple [yet competing] responses that match the issue” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). This brings together response repertoires that are usually applied separately—for instance, working with peripheral stakeholders, such as social activists (Hart & Sharma, 2004\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
