Similarly, the somewhat counterintuitive finding of a stronger relationship for accounting-based measures of CFP for studies measuring both constructs concurrently clearly warrants further investigations. Is the relationship indeed mainly driven by mechanisms internal to the firm rather than by external aspects? Furthermore, our analysis of potential moderation effects regarding the influence of control variables was limited to variables that had been employed in a sufficiently large number allowing subgroup comparisons. Given that the most commonly used control variables, except firm risk, did not appear to influence the results in a systematic manner, our analysis opens the door to an examination of other factors that might be involved in the focal relationship. In particular, we encourage scholars to look “under the tip of the iceberg” (Delmas et al., 2011) and to examine the influence of less visible aspects, which remained unexplored (e.g., human capital, organizational learning, or certain management styles). Additionally, future research may examine several characteristics of the general business environment, highlighted by contingency theorists, which might be important determinants of the CEP–CFP relationship (Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Russo & Minto, 2012). Future research should also look to the concrete mechanisms of how financial risk influences the focal relationship. While Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001), regarding the CSP–CFP link, conceived financial risk as a mediator, we argue that risk might also constitute a confounding variable. Less risky firms constitute generally favored investments and thus face lower costs of capital and higher levels of CFP.\n\n# Appendix A.
