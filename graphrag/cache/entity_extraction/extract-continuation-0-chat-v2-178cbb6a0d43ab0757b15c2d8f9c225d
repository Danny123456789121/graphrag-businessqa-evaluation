In this meta-analysis, then; the confidence interval of the effect size estimator is _. 93 _ (1.96)(.20) < D< -.93 + (1.96)(.20), which simplifies to -1.32<D< -.54. This means quite simply that we can be 95% confident that the difference between the distribution of the abnormal returns and the normal returns is at least ~. 54 standard deviation units and may be as much as -1.32 standard deviation units. Without any clear standards existing in the event study methodology with which to evaluate an effect size of approximately -1 standard deviation unit, one is forced to fall back on Cohen and Cohen's (1983 rule of thumb for interpreting effect sizes: d = .2 (small effect), d = .5 (medium effect), and d = .8 (large effect). Effect sizes from _.93 to -1.32 are quite substantial, then, and even an effect size as small as _.54 (the upper limit of the confidence interval) still shows that socially irresponsible and illicit behavior can have a moderate effect on abnormal returns.\n\nDs were also calculated under all the various assumptions indicated in Table 4 and ranged from D = -683 (for the sample of studies using irresponsible behavior as their events) to D = -1.201 (for the sample of studies using CAARs). The average D for these seven meta-analysis samples reported in Table 4 is -.912, which reflects as large an effect as the full sample of 27 event studies.\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nFrom the test for significance it is clear that abnormal returns are significant and negative across the studies. These event studies are showing that shareholder wealth is decreased when firms act in a socially irresponsible or illegal manner; This supports Proposition 3, suggesting that acting in a socially responsible and law-abiding manner can be seen as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for increasing shareholder wealth, all other things equal. This would suggest, then, that the maxim (Proposition 1) of enlightened self-interest may indeed serve the shareholder's interests. In addition, the effect size is substantial ~approximately a full standard deviation unit; This means that the distribution of abnormal returns, which is expected to be centered around zero (i.e., generally no abnormal returns).\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nare expected), is shifted dramatically to the negative side of zero. A shift to the left in the distribution of abnormal returns by a full standard deviation indicates a strong negative effect on shareholder wealth.\n\nFor theorists, these results lend support to the normative ethical position of enlightened self-interest. It supplies those doing research in business ethics and corporate social responsibility with empirical results showing that social responsibility does indeed have a role to play in business. These results also present a self-interested reason to practitioners to be socially responsible and law abiding: Such a self-interested reason seems needed due to the simple fact that no other reason has worked or may ever work. Christopher Stone (1975), for instance, pointed out in a chapter titled Why the Law Can't Do It that the legal system is best at enforcing minimum behavior—in a sense, preventing people from being bad—but Mancur Olson (1965) showed why calls for socially responsible cooperation may fail due to the free rider problem. In short; maybe a self-interested, economic argument is the only argument that may work. Thomas Schelling (1978) has observed that self-interest has succeeded at motivating people to be good at times when the law, social contracting, the golden rule, and other moral arguments have all failed. The argument supported here—that socially responsible and law-abiding behavior is a necessary condition for increasing shareholder wealth—is one argument that can be directed at economically self-interested firms.\n\nTo continue building the case in favor of socially responsible behavior; additional work still needs to be done by researchers regarding event studies. The rest of this section poses three questions to guide such research:\n\nOne question future research ought to address is whether the market rewards socially responsible and law-abiding behavior. This article meta-analyzed studies looking only at whether shareholder wealth was affected by firms engaging in socially irresponsible and illegal behavior: This was done because this was essentially the data that were available. (The 27 studies of irresponsible and illicit behavior constitute a reasonable sample size for meta-analysis.) Only 3 studies have examined the effects on shareholder wealth of socially responsible behavior; and 3 studies do not represent a large enough sample for meta-analysis. Of the 3 studies, Shane and Spicer (1983) found that there were significantly negative abnormal returns for companies that were given bad pollution ratings and that there were significantly positive abnormal returns for companies receiving good pollution ratings.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\non the shareholder wealth of firms withdrawing from South Africa (Meznar et al, 1994) or adopting the Sullivan Principles (Patten; 1990), found no significant effects. Both studies noted that using actions toward South Africa as an event presented this complication: Arguments were made in the CSR literature demonstrating that remaining in South Africa was socially responsible. So was socially irresponsible, but other arguments in the CSR literature although it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these three studies as a group; their existence indicates that it is at least possible to conduct event studies focused on socially responsible events. I believe that more such event studies are called for; and at some future date a meta-analysis of socially responsible behavior and its effects on shareholder wealth would be warranted.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>A meta-analysis discussing the effects of socially irresponsible behavior on shareholder wealth and abnormal returns in firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTOPHER STONE<|>PERSON<|>Christopher Stone is a theorist who discussed the limitations of the legal system in enforcing socially responsible behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANCUR OLSON<|>PERSON<|>Mancur Olson is a theorist who highlighted the free rider problem in calls for socially responsible cooperation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS SCHELLING<|>PERSON<|>Thomas Schelling is a theorist who observed that self-interest can motivate good behavior when other moral arguments fail.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business Society is a publication that discusses the intersection of business practices and societal impacts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>BUSINESS SOCIETY<|>The Frooman Meta-Analysis was published in Business Society, discussing the impact of social responsibility on shareholder wealth.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTOPHER STONE<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>Christopher Stone's theories on the legal system's limitations are referenced in the Frooman Meta-Analysis.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANCUR OLSON<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>Mancur Olson's theories on the free rider problem are discussed in the context of the Frooman Meta-Analysis.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS SCHELLING<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>Thomas Schelling's observations about self-interest motivating good behavior are referenced in the Frooman Meta-Analysis.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
