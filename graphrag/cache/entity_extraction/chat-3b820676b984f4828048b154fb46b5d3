It identifies patterns and crafts plausible replies but might not fully understand the underlying notions of the words. This could lead to responses that occasionally lack depth and discernment and possibly deviate from the topic, especially when tasked with activities demanding a subtle grasp of specific domain knowledge.\n\n# Research agenda\n\nThe following RQs provide a road map for future research on generative AI in education:\n\n- How do generative AI tools promote educational sustainability?\n- What are the optimal ways to promote Industry 5.0 (involving humans and generative education?\n- What are the drivers and barriers to adopting generative AI tools in education?\n- How can generative AI tools be used to support students with disabilities?\n- How can educators ensure the originality of students’ work in the era of generative AI?\n\n# Generative AI in Banking\n\n# Overview\n\nThe advancement of AI has resulted in generative AI, which involves using algorithms and models to create new, original content such as text, images, and videos. Unlike AI-based Chatbot that relies on preexisting data to make predictions or answer the user’s request, generative AI can create new data on its own, based on the patterns and structures it has learned from the training data. Generative AI has become increasingly popular due to its ability to create and generate new insights, data, and content. It was reported that ChatGPT exceeded 1 million users five days after its launch.\n\nWhile it can be said that the most prominent examples of generative AI are ChatGPT and DALL-E, it is imperative to recognize the swift evolution of these generative AI and the emerging innovations are backed by well-funded companies such as Google and Microsoft. OpenAI developed ChatGPT, Microsoft developed the Microsoft 365 Copilot, whereas Google developed Bard. Beyond text, generative AI like MusicLM can generate music and Midjourney can generate images. Ultimately, generative AI learns the underlying patterns from the training data to make it useful for various applications such as content creation, synthesis of images and videos, as well as natural language processing across different industries.\n\nWith the enormous amount of data available to banks and financial services providers, this commentary recognizes the prospects for generative AI to enhance financial services provision by autonomously learning from financial data. Banks are crucial service providers that interact with consumers, businesses, and organizations. They possess vast amounts of data that can be utilized for AI and ML applications like generative AI. With the growing prospects of generative AI and the banks’ access to large data sets, there are opportunities for banks to start exploring how to integrate generative AI into their business operations.\n\n# Opportunities\n\n# Creating a Generative AI Model for Banking\n\nThe abundant data available to banks presents possibilities for creating models to respond to customers’ inquiries and train staff on financial services and products. While ChatGPT is a general-purpose LLM based on big data which is available over the internet, banks are expected to create generative AI models that can offer specific insight for financial services. This would be building on the works done by Bloomberg which has introduced its own generative AI called BloombergGPT that has been trained on a variety of financial data, including Bloomberg’s financial data archives and public sources. Bloomberg set out to build a model that achieves best-in-class results on financial benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general-purpose LLM benchmarks. BloombergGPT is an indicator of what is to come in fintech whereby financial firms use their data to create ChatGPT-like models. While BloombergGPT represents the first step in developing and applying this technology in the financial industry, no public-facing chatbot interface exists. Instead, BloombergGPT is being integrated into Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nThere are enormous opportunities for banks, especially for commercial and retail banks, to consider developing domain-focused generative AI tools to enhance their business operations. They have the data and can start training models with these data to develop and provide a platform for consumer engagement.\n\n# Customer Engagement\n\nAligning with the idea of creating a domain-focused generative AI model, consumers can also use this platform to engage with banks to ask a question that applies to their needs. For example, consumers can ask for advice based on their individual characteristics.\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Staff\n\n- Contact center agents\n- Financial advisers\n- Marketers\n- Developers\n\n# Established Banks\n\n- Customer data\n- Public data\n- Generative AI\n- Retail\n- Accuracy of information\n- Trust in information\n- Whose responsibility\n\n# FinTech\n\n- Consumers\n- Regulators\n\n# Figure 3. Conceptual framework for generative AI in banking.\n\nPrompts such as “I am employed full time, I have three children, I have a mortgage, and I have a personal debt of £25,000, what financial advice can you offer me?” The bank’s generative AI should be able to offer some financial advice and recommendation based on the large data set used to train the model. This generative AI builds on existing technology infrastructure for chatbots that can assist customers with their banking needs. These chatbots can understand natural language and provide personalized responses to customer queries. Generative AI can also be used to develop investment strategies that can optimize portfolio returns based on various factors, such as risk tolerance, market conditions, and asset allocation.\n\n# Fraud detection\n\nFrom a banking perspective, generative AI models have access to a large amount of data (e.g., legal, fraud, and compliance documents) which would assist in understanding patterns of fraud and other financial crimes. Generative AI can be used to detect fraudulent transactions in banking services. These models can identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data in real-time and proactively flag potential fraudulent transactions.\n\n# Marketing communication\n\nBanks can use generative AI to develop marketing communication campaigns that appeal to their target audience.
