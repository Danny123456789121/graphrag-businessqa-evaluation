Accordingly, public accountability becomes vital for the widely held companies because these enterprises have a greater chance of being detained by the public as a whole (Mohd Ghazali, 2007) and such companies have to provide substantial social information (Ahmed Haji, 2013). Hence, it is our expectation that concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures (CSD) express the significant negative relationship. Prior academic literature has scrutinized on the relationship between concentrated ownership and CSD, and the previous results provide controversial findings. For example, Lu and...\n\nAbeysekera (2014) finds a significant negative relationship between concentrated ownership and CSD. In Contrary, Sufian and Zahan (2013), and Majeed et al. (2015) find an insignificant and positive association between concentrated ownership and CSD. In addition, some studies found insignificant and negative impact of concentrated ownership on CSD (Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007, Li and Zhang, 2010, Naser et al., 2006).\n\n# 3. Research Methodology\n\n# 3.1 Sample\n\nFor the meta-analysis, the previous 29 studies published ranging from 2004 to 2016 yielding 5437 sample size has considered. All of the articles in the meta-analysis has been collected from the top journal publishers around the world to select the studies which examine the determinants of corporate social disclosures in the context of corporate governance. The study gives importance on the good impact factor journals or books abstracted and indexed by the Thomson Reuters, The Association of Business Schools (ABS), Scopus, and Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) databases. The characteristics of the selected sample studies have shown in Tables 1 & 2.\n\n[Insert Table 1]\n\n[Insert Table 2]\n\n# 3.2 Research Instrument\n\nThis study attempts to conduct the meta-analysis technique of Hunter et al. (1982) to reconcile the mixed results of conflicting views of the prior studies. In the current study, the meta-analysis methodology is also a similar nature of other researchers (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990, Rosenthal, 1991, Ahmed and Courtis, 1999, Khlif and Souissi, 2010, Souissi and Khlif, 2012, Eddine et al., 2015, Siddiqui, 2015).\n\nThe narrative analysis of the previous literature is not appropriate because the nature of the previous studies vary due to variations of sample size, time, country and other characteristics. Moreover, researchers found different results from various studies (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). According to Ahmed and Courtis (1999), “Meta-analysis enables to give consistent results and overcome the problems of narrative findings.” Meta-analysis is a statistical technique to reconcile the mixed results of the prior studies (Souissi and Khlif, 2012) and it evaluates the different consequences of the results from the previous studies (García-Meca and Sánchez-Ballesta, 2009). The best definition provided by Glass (1976) as of meta-analysis is a technique by which the findings of the extensive collection of studies accumulated.\n\nIn the existing literature of meta-analysis technique, the degree of association between dependent and independent variables are measured using the effect size which is called the coefficient of correlation (r). In this paper, the value of r is calculated for each study sample to measure effect size of each explanatory variable. The value of r is computed based on t-\n\n9 | P a g e\n\n# 4. Empirical Results\n\nTable 3 summarizes the meta-analysis results of all the explanatory variables. The table shows whether there is any significant or insignificant impact of CG on CSD. In addition, Table 4 to Table 6 explains the subgroups analysis of the studies on the basis of the developed and developing countries (where applicable). The subgrouping analysis assists in removing heterogeneity (Eddine et al., 2015).\n\n[Insert Table 3]\n\nThe empirical results have analyzed separately for each variable as follows:\n\n# 4.1 Board Independence\n\nThe general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.086, 95% confidence interval -0.1863; 0.3583) between board independence and CSD using 3620 sample sizes of 17 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The results is similar with Razak and Mustapha (2013), Lim et al. (2008), and Nurhayati et al. (2016). To test the heterogeneity, the chi-square statistic applies here. The chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 88.33) is significant (p < 0.01) which means homogeneity test is rejected. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 19.25% of the observed variance. Therefore, further analysis needed to remove heterogeneity and in Table 4, we split the total studies into developed and developing countries. Both the studies of developed (𝑟 = 0.1737, 95% confidence interval -0.0675; 0.4145) and developing (𝑟 = 0.0698, 95% confidence interval -0.1968; 0.3364) countries indicates an insignificant positive association. The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between board independence and CSD due to the differences of country of study.\n\n[Insert Table 4]\n\n# 4.2 Board Size\n\nTable 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 =\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MOHD GHAZALI<|>PERSON<|>Mohd Ghazali is a researcher who has contributed to the literature on corporate social disclosures and ownership structures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AHMED HAJI<|>PERSON<|>Ahmed Haji is a researcher who has studied the relationship between concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LU AND<|>PERSON<|>Lu and is a researcher who found a significant negative relationship between concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUFIAN AND ZAHAN<|>PERSON<|>Sufian and Zahan are researchers who found an insignificant and positive association between concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAJEED ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Majeed et al. are researchers who also studied the relationship between concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RASHID AND LODH<|>PERSON<|>Rashid and Lodh are researchers who found an insignificant and negative impact of concentrated ownership on corporate social disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Hunter et al. are researchers known for their work on meta-analysis techniques in social sciences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMSON REUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thomson Reuters is a global information and news company that provides data and analytics for various sectors, including business and finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS SCHOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association of Business Schools is a professional body that represents business schools and promotes high standards in business education.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scopus is a bibliographic database containing abstracts and citations for academic journal articles across various disciplines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS DEANS COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Australian Business Deans Council is an organization that represents business schools in Australia and promotes excellence in business education.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine results from multiple studies to identify patterns or effects across research findings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL DISCLOSURES<|>EVENT<|>Corporate social disclosures refer to the reporting of a company's social and environmental impacts and practices to stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOHD GHAZALI<|>AHMED HAJI<|>Both Mohd Ghazali and Ahmed Haji have contributed to the literature on corporate social disclosures and ownership structures<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LU AND<|>SUFIAN AND ZAHAN<|>Both Lu and Sufian and Zahan have researched the relationship between concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUFIAN AND ZAHAN<|>MAJEED ET AL.<|>Both Sufian and Zahan and Majeed et al. have studied the impact of concentrated ownership on corporate social disclosures<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RASHID AND LODH<|>AHMED HAJI<|>Rashid and Lodh's findings on concentrated ownership relate to Ahmed Haji's research on corporate social disclosures<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER ET AL.<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Hunter et al. are known for their work on meta-analysis techniques, which is a method used in the current study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMSON REUTERS<|>SCOPUS<|>Both Thomson Reuters and Scopus are databases that provide access to academic research and publications<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS SCHOOLS<|>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS DEANS COUNCIL<|>Both organizations represent business schools and promote high standards in business education<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
