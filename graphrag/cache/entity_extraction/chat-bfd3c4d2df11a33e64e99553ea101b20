Alice Richardson is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Information Sciences and Engineering, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia.\n\n# Abstract\n\nPurpose – This purpose of this paper is to identify the possible sources of variation of results in prior studies linking corporate social responsibility (CSR) with corporate financial performance (CFP).\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – A meta-analysis was performed on 51 prior studies included in Orlitzky et al. in order to ensure compatibility with previous results. The meta-analysis is based on sub-groups of papers in five-year time intervals focusing on sample size and methodology employed as the sources of variation concerning the nexus between CSR and CFP.\n\nFindings – The major finding of the study is that sample size and methodology are significant sources of variation in measuring the link between CSR and CFP.\n\nResearch limitations/implications – The findings are likely to help develop a structural framework towards broadening and deepening our understanding of the debate regarding the sources of variation in the measurement of CSR and CFP link. This research is limited to papers published up to 1999 as included in Orlitzky et al. Future research can update the findings by using data beyond 1999.\n\nOriginality/value – This paper can be considered an advance on the previous research as it contributes to broadening our understanding of the possible source of causes of variation in results of studies linking CSR with CFP.\n\nKeywords Corporate social responsibility, Financial performance, Meta analysis, Profitability, Sub-group analysis, Company performance\n\nPaper type Research paper\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nResearch into corporate social responsibility (CSR) has generated considerable interest amongst academic and practitioners over the past decades. The issue has gained renewed momentum in the post global financial crisis era. For the purpose of this paper CSR is defined as those responsibilities that corporations undertake to satisfy organisational goals as well as societal needs in a balanced way that serves the interests of both businesses and the community. Various facets of CSR have been researched in the past. These include, for example, managerial attitudes towards CSR (Quazi, 2003), theoretical aspects of CSR and ethics (Hunt and Vitell, 1984), cross-cultural facets of CSR (Quazi and O’Brien, 2000), CSR and quality of life (Rugimbana et al., 2008), and CSR and competitive advantage (Porter and Krammer, 2005). However, one particular issue concerning the relationship between CSR and the financial performance of firms has generated enormous interest amongst academics, policy makers and practitioners (Ullmann, 1985; Marom, 2006). The issue is that businesses and practitioners would like to see a business case to justify their commitment to CSR.
