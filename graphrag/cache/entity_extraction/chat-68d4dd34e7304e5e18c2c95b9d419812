In addition, enhance the security and privacy of the model, such as model encryption [270-272], to prevent the model from being stolen or reversed.\n---\n# 3) Ensure System Security.\n\nFor the LSF-Model-based PHM system, establish a monitoring system to detect abnormal operations and attack behaviors in time and record operation and audit logs simultaneously to investigate and trace security incidents.\n\n# 5.2.3 Roadmaps for Credibility\n\nImproving the credibility of LSF-Models is a comprehensive and complex issue, which can be optimized and improved from the following aspects.\n\n1. Improve the Quality of Data. Data quality forms the basis for model training, and ensuring data quality is essential for enhancing the model's credibility. Therefore, a series of measures need to be taken to ensure data quality, including data cleaning, removing outliers, data enhancement, etc.\n2. Improve the Robustness of the Model. Explore new solutions to improve the robustness and anti-interference ability of the model, such as improving the performance of the model in noisy [9, 10, 273-276], distribution shift [277-281] and out-of-distribution scenarios [282-284].\n3. Improve the Comprehensiveness of Model Evaluation. The comprehensiveness and fairness of evaluation are crucial in improving the model's credibility. To achieve this, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate models using multiple evaluation indicators and multiple datasets while avoiding problems such as model bias for specific scenarios.\n4. Guarantee Model Traceability. In order to improve the credibility of the model, it is necessary to fully record and trace the development, training, testing, deployment, and other processes of the model. This can ensure that the process of the model is controllable and the results can be verified, thereby improving the credibility of the model.\n\n# 5.2.4 Roadmaps for Transferability\n\nThe objective of conducting LSF-Models is to advance the concept of a universal model capable of performing all tasks. With this aim in mind, we are dedicated to creating a comprehensive multi-task PHM system. To achieve this goal, it is the top priority to improve the portability and adaptability of foundation models as much as possible. The PHM field encompasses a diverse range of downstream tasks, and its application objects are complex, thus necessitating the exploration of new architecture design approaches, feature learning methods, and training algorithms for real-world industrial scenarios to enhance transferability.\n\n1. Explore Flexible Model Architecture Design. To construct a general-purpose foundation model, it is necessary to investigate flexible model architecture designs that can be customized for different types of PHM applications, such as monitoring, diagnosis, prediction, and others.\n2. Explore General Feature Representation Methods. Extracting valuable features from different data types is the key to realizing general models. These feature representation algorithms need to be able to capture various types of failure modes and also need to be robust to different types of failure data.\n3. Explore Training Algorithms that are Suitable for PHM Applications. Although a large number of self-supervised training algorithms [49, 69-71, 124, 125] have been proposed in the fields of NLP and\n---\n# 5.2.5 Roadmaps for Advanced Cognition\n\nLSF-Models have the potential to acquire advanced cognition and learn general concepts from data using vast amounts of training data and well-designed algorithms. In the field of PHM, LSF-Models with advanced cognitive capabilities can well understand the nature and general concepts of industrial data. As a result, LSF-Models can promptly adapt to varying industrial scenarios and tasks, effectively avoiding the generation of unintelligible outputs. However, the advanced cognitive capabilities displayed by current LSF-Models are inadequate. In addition to scaling up the amount of training data, the following aspects require exploration:\n\n1. Explore the Data Requirements to Enable Advanced Cognitive Capabilities. Although some existing LSF-Models have demonstrated limited advanced cognitive abilities, what kind of data and how much data is needed to achieve such abilities is unknown. In addition, how to make full use of data information to obtain considerable cognitive ability on relatively small data sets is also a topic worthy of research.\n2. Explore Model Requirements for Achieving Advanced Cognitive Capabilities. Most existing LSF-Models adopt Transformer architecture, but it has limitations. Hence, exploring new Transformer architectures or designing novel model architectures to enable LSF-Models to exhibit better cognitive capabilities are areas that warrant exploration.\n3. Explore the Theoretical Requirements for Achieving Advanced Cognitive Capabilities. The realization of advanced cognitive abilities cannot rely solely on a considerable amount of experimental analysis; it also requires appropriate theories to provide guiding solutions. Therefore, exploring the reasons and mechanisms behind the acquisition of advanced cognitive abilities by LSF-Models will significantly advance the field.\n\n# 5.2.6 Roadmaps for Interpretability\n\nDeep learning has been criticized for its lack of interpretability and transparency, and this deficiency is more evident in LSF-Models. Improving the interpretability and transparency of these models would enhance their credibility, controllability, and reliability, making them more suitable for application in critical industrial fields such as aerospace and nuclear energy. Future research can be explored from the following three aspects to address this issue.\n\n1. Explore Deep Interpretable Models. In the field of PHM, a feasible solution is to realize a deep model with high interpretability by means of the theoretical basis of signal analysis methods [41, 46, 47, 263]. Moreover, incorporating prior knowledge or physical background information into the model can also enhance its interpretability significantly.\n2. Explore Methods for Analyzing Model Interpretability. According to the characteristics of deep models, practical methods for analyzing model interpretability need to be explored.
