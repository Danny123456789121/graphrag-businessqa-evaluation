DISCUSSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH\n\nThe correlation coefficient method is more likely to be observed in a positive CSP-CFP relationship than the other two simple methods (for example, regression or survey).\n\nUsing meta-analysis, this study examines the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Recall that the hypothesis predicts that there is no relationship between CSP and CFP. The overall meta-analytic results suggest that corporate sustainability performance has a positive impact on corporate financial performance, especially in the long term. This implies that in the long run, market forces reward companies that are high in corporate sustainability performance. This may motivate managers to pursue CSP even though the company may not be profitable in the short run. In addition, the moderator effects analysis using the generalized least squares (GLS) method and meta-analytic procedures show that: (1) compared to social responsibility, environmental responsibility, to a larger extent, contributes to the positive CSP-CFP relationship, inconsistent with the findings of Orlitzky et al. (2003). Environmental issues, such as climate change, have gained a lot of attention not only from large companies, but also from medium and small enterprises. By engaging in environmental improvement, firms improve their relationship with regulators, stakeholders, and the general public. (2) CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators. Future research may be needed to explain why accounting-based measures are preferred. (3) The study also finds sample characteristics play a significant moderating role in the CSP-CFP relationship. Multi-industry firms, pre-2000 sustainability studies, and non-U.S. firms appeared to have a stronger impact on the positive relationship than other sample indicators. (4) The methodology used in the prior studies also matters. The simple methods (such as correlation coefficient, regression, and survey) appear to have a stronger impact on the relationship between CSP and CFP compared to complex methods (such as two-stage least squares and three-stage least squares).\n\nThis study can be extended to other sustainability-related areas. For example, sustainability disclosure and corporate governance may be examined to investigate their impacts on the sustainability performance.\n\nIn conclusion, this study contributes to the current corporate sustainability literature by providing an in-depth investigation of different measures used for CSP and CFP, closely examining sample characteristics, and comparing different methodologies used in prior literature by using meta-analysis.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nAlexander, G.
