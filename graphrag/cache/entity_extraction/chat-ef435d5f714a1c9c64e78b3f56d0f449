In fact, overall the findings with respect to CSP operationalizations suggest that studies that used reputation indices as proxies for CSP showed the highest average correlation with CFP (ρ of .73 with a large variance of .19; entry 2.b in Table 4a). Of course, this high correlation may partially be due to halo (Brown and Perry 1994).\n\nFurthermore, repeating the pattern of results testing reputation-theory effects (Table 3), disclosure measures appear to be only minimally related to CFP (robs = .04, ρ = .09, as shown in entry 2.a). This finding is generalizable because almost all the observed variance is explained by artefacts. Social audits, CSP processes, and outcomes are only modestly correlated with CFP (robs = .09, ρ = .18; entry 2.c). Similar mean correlations were found for the relationship between corporate social responsibility values or attitudes and CFP (robs = .10, ρ = .21; entry 2.d). The second level in the hierarchical breakdown supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study artefacts, stakeholder mismatching, other theoretical mis-specifications, or lack of theory (cf. also McWilliams and Siegel 2000). As discussed above, the overall percentage of cross-study variance (in robs) explained is 24 percent. In general, this percentage tends to increase in the measurement subgroups listed in Table 4a, which suggests that studies systematically differ with respect to the distortions caused by (previously uncorrected) statistical and methodological artefacts. The fact that artefacts account for 15 –100 percent of cross-study variance (the notorious ‘inconsistencies’ of this research stream) provides support for Hypothesis 4a.\n\nThe support for theoretical inconsistencies (stakeholder mismatching) becomes apparent by looking at some second-level hierarchical subgroups. First, the correlation of CSP disclosure measures with accounting CFP measures is slightly negative (ρ = –.02; entry 2.a.2). This small correlation supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis because there is no theoretical causal mechanism between CSP disclosures and internal (that is, accounting) CFP measures. Second, the observed and corrected correlations between (a) social audit and other observable or ‘objective’ (for example, dollar amount of charitable contributions) measures of CSP processes and (b) market-based measures of CFP are close to zero (Table 4a, entry 2.c.1), which again supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis. As Wood and Jones (1995: 242) argued earlier, ‘There is no theory to explain why stockholders would or would not prefer a company that gives one percent of pre-tax earnings to charity, that hires and develops minority or women workers, or that ranks higher in pollution control indices.’ In other words, the data suggest that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioural measures of CSP (such as charitable donations), perhaps because they are perceived as direct attempts by firms to manage external impressions.\n\nTo examine the measurement moderators within subgroup 2.c even more closely, Table 4b shows results for social audits disaggregated from other CSP behaviours, which are further broken down.\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nworthy. First, social audits were consistently, but only modestly, correlated with CFP (ρ = .23, 100 percent of cross-study variance explained). Second, across industry contexts, philanthropic donations were related with CFP at ρ = .29, which was higher than the respective correlation coefficients found for all other measures of CSP behaviours. However, the file drawer analyses (last column of Table 4b) suggest that some of the findings presented in Table 4b are not conclusive because a small number of additional studies could change our conclusions.\n\n# Discussion\n\n# Theoretical Implications\n\nBased on this meta-analysis integrating 30 years of research, the answer to the introductory question posed by Business Week is affirmative. The results of this meta-analysis show that there is a positive association between CSP and CFP across industries and across study contexts. In that sense, we can confirm Frooman’s (1997) conclusions, based on event studies, supporting the validity of enlightened self-interest in the social responsibility arena. The data accumulated over the past 30 years do not support the latest contingency theory in the area of corporate social responsibility (McWilliams and Siegel 2001). Like earlier research reviews, McWilliams and Siegel (2001) take inconsistent findings in primary studies at face value (that is, ignore the possible impact of sampling error and measurement error) and explain the (apparent) inconsistency with a demand/supply model of corporate social responsibility. Moreover, the temporal analysis of our meta-analysis shows that the positive association between CFP and lagged CSP (slack resources argument) does not mask a weaker negative association between CSP and lagged CFP.\n\nCan CSP be motivated by an ‘ecological selection process based on profit maximization or organizational survival’ (Wholey and Brittain 1986, in Husted 2000: 33)? Husted (2000: 34) agrees with the narrative reviews in this area, stating that it is ‘pre\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
