The greenness and transparency factor is constructed based on 942 companies listed on the STOXX Europe Total Market Index.\n\nBy relying on company-level disclosures and factoring-in their transparency, we try to tackle the issue of green-washing, which is likely to be the reason why the literature has so far failed to find a consensus on the existence of a priced green factor. Indeed, looking at the actual composition of the portfolios of publicly traded investment funds which label themselves as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’, it turns out that many funds are clearly less environmentally friendly than their name would suggest. For example, a fund might indeed limit its exposure to carbon-intensive sectors, but at the same time mainly invest in e.g. financial stocks. Banks, insurers and other financial institutions are admittedly directly responsible for a very small fraction of GHG emissions, but financial institutions are prob-\n\n1 On the uncertainty on the rate of increase in average temperatures in the long-medium horizon, and on the effects of climate change, see e.g. Pindyck (2013). 2 These objectives are listed in the European Commission Action plan on financing sustainable growth, which sets out an EU strategy for sustainable finance.\n\nably not what comes to mind when thinking of companies that are at the forefront of efforts to reduce emissions. At the level of the individual company, there could be a tendency to disclose only partial information, emphasizing the environmental dimensions where the firm performs best and neglecting those where the firm does not as well. For example, a car manufacturer may report its scope 1 GHG emissions, i.e. emissions from sources that it owns or controls, but could have an incentive not to disclose its scope 3 emissions, which include emissions resulting from the use of the vehicles it produces and sells. By considering the completeness of the relevant information that firms disclose, we deal with this type of greenwashing.\n\nAt the same time, however, one should be careful not to take extreme views when defining ‘green’ stocks. As a matter of fact, portfolio diversification is crucial for asset managers, and concentrating the exposure on a small set of pure green players is not a viable option. Our society will still need e.g. steel and cement for quite a while, and companies’ low-carbon transition is a much needed but gradual process. For all these reasons, a sensible approach would be to broaden the scope of the definition of ‘green’ beyond pure players to also include firms that meet the highest level of energy efficiency and the lowest CO2 emissions within the relevant sector. By taking this approach, a steel manufacturer which also uses scrap steel is greener than one that does not. By the same token, an energy company that reduces its reliance on fossil fuels – though not having an entirely renewable energy mix – is greener than one that is not reducing its carbon footprint. This is the approach taken by several providers of environmental ratings, which assess the sustainability of firms relative to their peers, and also the one we take in this paper.\n\nWe show that in the context of a standard asset pricing model, the portfolios we build based on firms’ environmental performance and disclosures are associated with a positive intercept, suggesting the existence of an omitted factor. Based on this evidence, we propose to include a greenness and transparency factor, which we construct based on a long-short strategy involving the greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio. We find that the Greenium, i.e. the risk premium associated with this greenness and transparency factor, is negative and highly statistically significant. This means that investors accept a lower remuneration for their investments, ceteris paribus, insofar as these investments are linked to greener and more transparent firms. We interpret this as evidence of climate risk being viewed as significant, with the market seeing value in investing in greener assets as a hedging strategy towards worse environmental outcomes.\n\nIndeed, in a scenario of heightened risks resulting from climate change, there would be a stronger push towards more environmentally friendly activities, with more decisive political action likely to be taken to promote sustainable growth. Hence, companies active in green sectors and more transparent on their environmental performance would operate in a more favorable environment, possibly supported by incentives, e.g. fiscal or of other nature. At the same time, the likelihood would increase that some assets, e.g. coal, would become stranded. In this context, forward-looking investors who base their portfolio allocation on a broader information set than past returns, invest in greener assets already today.\n\nThe evidence we provide on the existence of a Greenium has clear financial stability implications. Indeed, we show that the European market as a whole does price climate risk. In this context, if an investor does not factor in\n\n3\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nClimate risk in the construction of her portfolio, she is in fact pricing her holdings based on a misspecified model, where the greenness and environmental transparency factor is omitted. Should this mispricing affect the assets held by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) such as large banks, insurers and pension funds, there could be consequences in terms of systemic risk. In particular, asset returns on their holdings could be negatively affected by climate change via two main channels. First, in a longer horizon perspective, more frequent and severe natural catastrophes stemming from climate change (e.g. typhoons and floods) could negatively affect returns on assets linked to particularly vulnerable economic activities. These are the so-called physical risks related to climate change, that we do not tackle in this paper directly. However, it has been shown that rising temperatures have strong adverse effects on asset valuations, as well as on key macroeconomic aggregates and productivity (see Donadelli et al., 2017).
