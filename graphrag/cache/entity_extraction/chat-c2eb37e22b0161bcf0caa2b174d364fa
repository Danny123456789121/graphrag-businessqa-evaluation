Thus, they may use social and sustainability policy to achieve this goal by prioritizing social and sustainability elements that may be more favorable to their purpose.\n\nHigh concentrated ownership, frequently associated to a reduced number of controlling shareholders, may promote the exacerbation of private benefits of control (Riyanto and Toolsema, 2008) and may also be detrimental to the adoption of good corporate governance practices under the argument that controlling shareholders benefit from weaker corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Bozec and Bozec, 2007; Renders and Gaeremynck, 2012).\n\nSustainability indices, as is the case of ISE in Brazil, have corporate governance as a very relevant component as mentioned above (Section 2.2). In this context, high ownership concentration may also be negative to public firm accountability that tends to improve with a decrease in ownership concentration and more shareholders pressuring for better firm accountability in the opposite direction of high ownership concentration (Li and Zhang, 2010).\n\nAlthough stakeholders theorists claim the value creation capacity of social and sustainability performance, such capacity for value creation is still uncertain (Husted and Allen, 2007). This doubtful value creation capacity of firm‚Äôs social and sustainability activities may discourage controlling shareholders to undertake social and sustainability policies. Besides, corporate governance which is not a priority for dominant blockholders is really important in the ISE sustainability index. Thus, it seems plausible to propose the hypothesis that dominant shareholders of the Brazilian firm are looking for private benefits of control and do not prioritize the improvement of firm sustainability in its entirety. This rationale leads to the proposal that voting ownership concentration is negative to CSP as proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index in the following terms:\n\n# H1.\n\nOwnership concentration has an adverse effect on the probability of the firm‚Äôs membership to the ISE sustainability index which signals firm CSP.\n\nFirm‚Äôs commitment to social and sustainability issues have been proposed to be favorable to firm‚Äôs image and reputation under the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical frameworks (Bebbington et al., 2008; Michelon, 2011). Nowadays, environmental concerns are relevant for firm‚Äôs external valuation, and this reality has motivated more complete firm sustainability disclosure (Crifo et al., 2015; Bouten et al., 2011). In fact, empirical research has proposed and found evidence on the influence that environmental activities have on corporate reputation (D‚ÄôSouza et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2012).\n\nFirms from environmental risky industries have more complex relation with the natural environment and external stakeholders tend to be more focused on such firms‚Äô concerns on environmental issues (Hackston and Milne, 1996; Adams, 2002; Patten, 2002; Campbell, 2003). Because of this higher vulnerability to environmental concerns and pressure from stakeholders, firms with activities that are more aggressive to the natural environment will try to signal stakeholders that they follow adequate sustainable practices through adequate sustainability disclosure (Campbell, 2003; Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009; Dyduch and Krasodomska, 2017).\n\nIn Brazil, it is important to evaluate the role played by firm industry environmental risk on CSP, given the raising relevance devoted to this issue since the enactment of important legal instruments. It is important to mention the Brazilian Environmental Policy Law 6,938/1981 (revised by Law 10,165/2000), and the Brazilian Constitution/1988 are influential legal\n\njSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j\n\ninstruments that highlighted the importance of firm environmental concerns. Both these influential legal instruments highlighted the importance of firms‚Äô environmental concerns. The enactment of Law 10.165/2000 was a threshold for firms‚Äô environmental concerns in Brazil by stratifying firm industry under environmental risk layers (low, medium and high), establishing the Control and Environmental Inspection Fee for all firms from stratified sectors, and also by compelling stratified firms to report annual activities to the government.\n\nFirm‚Äôs relation with the government and with the natural environment is crucial under the stakeholder theoretical framework. Thus, together with increasing social pressures, Brazilian institutional setting has faced advances in environmental legislation to impose stricter rules on firms in relation with the natural environment. The advances in legal rules, associated with local and international social pressures, tend to force firms to be more committed to environmental, social and sustainability issues which may also be reflected in the search for higher CSP and positive visibility through the presence in sustainability indices as proposed in the following hypothesis:\n\n# H2.\n\nFirms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm‚Äôs membership to the ISE sustainability index.\n\nThe stakeholder theory proposes the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm performance under the rationale that social responsibility actions are able to create value for the firm because society has a positive sensitivity to this type of corporate action (Freeman et al., 2004; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Stakeholder theorists indeed contend that under the perspective that the firm must be concerned with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, the company must look for maximizing not only shareholders‚Äô interests but also all other stakeholders‚Äô interests, which may be achieved through the commitment to ESG issues that are related to a wider range of stakeholders. They advocate that such commitment is able to foster the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm‚Äôs performance.\n\nIn fact, prior research on the relationship between CSP and firm profitability has seen it as dynamic with results revealing profitability as a determinant of CSP and also the opposite (Garcia-C\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
