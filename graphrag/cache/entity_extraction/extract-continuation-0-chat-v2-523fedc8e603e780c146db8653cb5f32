The results of the ANOVA show that the change of the sustainability score over time is significant (F = 24.86, df = 4, p < 0.0001) and that there is a significant difference in the sustainability score between the banks (F = 12.83, df = 55, p < 0.0001). Additionally, the full model is significant (F = 13.65, df = 59, p < 0.0001) and explains 79 percent of the total variance.\n\nIn addition, Figure 1 shows that the development over time is very similar for all three categories. As tested above, the environmental sustainability category has the highest value before social sustainability and green products and services.\n\nAs the next step, we conducted a fixed-effects panel regression (see above for the Haussman test indicating fixed effects). The financial indicators and the sustainability score were used as independent and time-lagged dependent variables, respectively, to analyze cause and effect between the sustainability score and the financial performance using Granger causality (see Table 5). To control for accuracy, we used bootstrapping with 50 replications. The results of the one-year time lags are presented in Table 6. Two- and three-year time lags did not suggest different results but are based on fewer data.\n\n# Table 6. Panel regression with time lag with the sustainability score and financial indicators as independent and dependent variables.\n\n|Dependent Variable|Independent Variable|Coefficient|R2|Sig.| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|(1-Year Time Lag)|Sustainability Score|Total Assets|0.063|0.13|0.018|\n| |Total Assets|Sustainability Score|1.56|0.24|<0.00001|\n| |Sustainability Score|Net Profit|0.007|0.08|0.530|\n| |Net Profit|Sustainability Score|3.25|0.19|0.0003|\n| |Sustainability Score|ROA|0.012|0.0009|0.443|\n| |ROA|Sustainability Score|1.78|0.0047|0.0080|\n| |Sustainability Score|ROE|−0.004|0.099|0.712|\n| |ROE|Sustainability Score|2.13|0.20|0.0130|\n\nThe results show significant regressions for SS predicting the lagged financial indicators. The higher SS, the higher the financial indicators of the banks. The coefficients are positive and significant. Concerning the ability of the financial indicators to predict SS, only total assets, the indicator for the size of the banks, can predict the sustainability performance of a bank. There are no significant regressions for the other financial indicators as independent variables. Hence, the sustainability indicator is able to predict the financial performance, but financial indicators are not able to predict the sustainability performance of banks.\n\nTo test these findings for robustness, we used bootstrapping with 50 repetitions [79] and added the bank type as specified in Table 1 to the panel regressions. The results are presented in Table 7.\n\n# Table 7.
