His Majesty emphasized the “middle” path as the universal principle to life for Thai people at all levels and domains of application. The philosophy allows for a strategy for the nation to balance the national development and to deal with external forces. It emphasizes the requirement for adequate protection from shocks from inside and outside the nation. His Majesty reiterated the philosophy, after the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, in which countless large businesses and SMEs in Thailand went bankrupt, as the national strategy to economic recovery leading to a more resilient economy [ 19 ]. The philosophy is indeed responding to a call among corporate sustainability scholars for a new stakeholder-focus theory of the firm [20–24].\n\nSufficiency suggests three core principles of moderation, reasonableness, and resilience [7] and two underlying conditions of knowledge and virtues [7]. His Majesty emphasized the necessity of prudence in planning and its implementation, and carefulness in applying relevant knowledge. As for the virtues, Sufficiency Economy demands that people live their lives with the virtuous values of perseverance, harmlessness and generosity. They must adopt the honesty and integrity principles to be sustainable. Comparatively, the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy highlights virtuous values and morality as fundamental to sustainable management, consistent with the Stakeholder theory of the west [25].\n\nKantabutra et al. [ 26 ] pioneered SEP research into the business organization by qualitatively exploring the corporate leadership practices among publicly listed companies in Thailand. These companies are market leaders and survived major crises. The practices were derived as the Sufficiency Economy Leadership Practices (SELP). The practices, their example supporting tools and techniques, and impact on corporate sustainability [27] (p. 4) are described in Table 1 below.\n\n|Practice Titles|Sufficiency Economy Leadership Practices|Example Supporting Tools/Techniques|Effects on Corporate Sustainability|Relevant Sufficiency Economy Principles|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1. Long term orientation|Adopt a long-term perspective in running an enterprise. Do not try to maximize short-term profitability, but consider the consequence in the long run. This includes anticipation of future trends and changes, and investment in people and the organization to prepare for future change.|Short and long term planning; Feasibility study; Contingency planning.|Capacity to respond to environmental changes and to manage risks.|Moderation, Reasonableness and Resilience|\n|2. Gradual expansion|Expand the business carefully, although doing so may limit short-term profitability.|Feasibility study; Competition and industry analysis.|Minimized risks, ready to respond to environmental changes.|Moderation and Resilience|\n|3. Risk management|Manage risks by having a variety of products, markets and investments, based on the core competency of the organization.|Financial ratios; strategic and operational risk assessment; key risk indicators.|Minimized risks, ensuring business continuity.|Reasonableness, Resilience and Knowledge|\n|4. Employee priority|Genuine concern with employees by continuously developing and retaining them even during economic and social crises. Promotion from within the organization is given priority.|Training need analysis; succession planning; Management By Walking Around; Employee satisfaction index; Organizational climate survey.|High level of innovation and capacity to respond to unexpected environmental changes.|Moderation, Reasonableness and Morality|\n|5. Strong culture|Develop a strong organizational culture, characterized by ethics, perseverance, diligence and innovation.|Vision communication; company poems and songs; Ceremonies; Shared events such as “Creative Saturday”.|Organizational effectiveness.|Knowledge and Morality|\n|6. Innovation|Nurture incremental and radical innovation throughout the entire organization.|New product introduction rate; Process improvement indicators; Creativity workshop.|High level of radical and incremental innovation, making it very difficult to imitate. Capacity to maintain a leadership position in its relevant market.|Reasonableness and Knowledge|\n|7. In-house technology|Develop manufacturing or service technology which is not expensive but effective, with a focus on utilizing Thai wisdom.|In-house technology development policy.|Minimized cost and capacity to compete in the market.|Reasonableness and Knowledge|\n|8. Resource utilization|Promote effective and efficient utilization of resources.|Percentage of waste; defection rate.|Minimized cost and capacity to compete in the market.|Reasonableness and Knowledge|\n|9. Stakeholder focus|Genuine concern for a wide range of stakeholders, including future generations and society, even though doing so increases expenses.|Stakeholder analysis; Stakeholder satisfaction index.|Social crisis prevention and assistance in times of difficulty, ensuring business continuity.|Moderation, Reasonableness and Morality|\n|10. Knowledge sharing|Share, including knowledge sharing with competitors, to develop a relevant market and to maximize benefits to consumers and society.|Knowledge sharing policy.|Continuing innovation.|Knowledge and Morality|\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\nExtending the previous research [24,26], a prior study [27] quantitatively examined associations between business practices according to the SEP and sustainability performance, using a sample of 112 Thai businesses. Findings indicate that the practices are significantly predictive of improved sustainability performance. A later study [5] was conducted to confirm these findings in a larger sample of 294 businesses from different industries in Thailand. The latter findings indicate that business practices consistent with SEP improved corporate sustainability performance. These practices were called sharing, geosocial development, perseverance, resilience and moderation, later informing the development of a theory of corporate sustainability [12]. The findings of the previous studies [5, 27] also endorse the prior findings by Kantabutra et al. [26]. In conclusion, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is empirically endorsed as an approach to corporate sustainability.\n\nIn 2016, there was a significant development in moving the Suff\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUFFICIENCY ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is a national strategy in Thailand that emphasizes moderation, reasonableness, and resilience in economic practices to ensure sustainable development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAILAND<|>GEO<|>Thailand is a Southeast Asian country where the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is implemented as a national strategy for economic recovery and sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KANTABUTRA ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Kantabutra et al. are researchers who pioneered studies on Sufficiency Economy Practices in business organizations in Thailand.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability performance refers to the effectiveness of business practices in achieving sustainable development goals, particularly in the context of Thai businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Corporate sustainability involves business practices that ensure long-term economic, social, and environmental health, particularly in relation to the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1997 ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS<|>EVENT<|>The 1997 Asian Economic Crisis was a significant economic downturn that affected many businesses in Thailand, leading to the adoption of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy as a recovery strategy.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUFFICIENCY ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY<|>THAILAND<|>The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is a national strategy implemented in Thailand to promote sustainable economic practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KANTABUTRA ET AL.<|>SUFFICIENCY ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY<|>Kantabutra et al. conducted research on the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and its application in corporate leadership practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Sustainability performance is a measure of how well corporate sustainability practices are implemented and their effectiveness<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUFFICIENCY ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY<|>1997 ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS<|>The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy was emphasized as a recovery strategy following the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis in Thailand<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>SUFFICIENCY ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY<|>Corporate sustainability practices are informed by the principles of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
