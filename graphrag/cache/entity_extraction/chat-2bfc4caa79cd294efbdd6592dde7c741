When a company develops a suitable GSV, the GSV motivates employees to strive for goals and values that contribute to employee behavior. Related research has indicated that a shared vision is crucial for enhancing employee environmental behavior [24,34,35,50]. Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed:\n\n# Hypothesis 2 (H2). GSV is positively associated with EEP.\n\n# 2.3. Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)\n\nPsychological Ownership (PO) refers to the relationship between a person and an object that is closely connected with the self [ 51 ]. The concept of ownership is partially based on the research of consumer behavior regarding the extended self and possession [ 52 ,53 ]. Isaacs [ 54 ] indicated that the thoughts in a person’s mind become a part of them. For an individual, when property is accepted in the mind, it becomes “mine” [55]. Legal ownership can provide an opportunity for individuals to assimilate themselves into a company and become part of it, which can enhance the emergence of ownership as a mental status [56]. Because ownership connects possessors to targets, when employees link work with emotion, their connection with the work becomes closer. Furthermore, positive attitudes and thoughts are generated to further promote work performance [57 ]. Ownership is a mental status experienced by humans in which people consider themselves to own a target (nonmaterial or material in nature) completely or partially [ 58]. According to Pierce et al. [58 ], PO refers to a personal sense of possession held by an individual for an immaterial or material object (“this is mine!”). Due to PO, an individual is willing to take responsibility or sacrifice for their organization [59].\n\nFor the sustainable development of an enterprise, the degree of PO of company members for their company’s green products affects their behavior and attitude as well as the company’s green management performance. GPPO occurs when a company member has a psychological sense of ownership for the company’s green products, treats the products as subject matter, generates positive attitudes and thoughts, and is willing to engage in off-role behavior and take risks for this behavior such as dedication and sacrifice [ 35 ]. Therefore, for companies that are moving toward sustainable development, the degree of GPPO affects employees’ behavior, attitudes, and organizational green management performance. Furthermore, when a company employee has strong GPPO, they would exhibit a positive attitude and positive ideas, be willing to take risks for the company, and make additional efforts and sacrifices [35].\n\n# 2.3.1. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)\n\nPersonal PO in organizations mainly originates from the four motivations of human needs: (1) Efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation. Of these motivations, stimulation needs are incentives for PO. Efficacy and effectance indicate that individuals can successfully\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\nexercise control and appear to have a sense of ownership, which is used as a source of attaining satisfaction. Self-Identity represents the personal experience of biasing the subject matter, and as a part of self-extension, the most important thing is to own. Such holdings symbolize a kind of identity and are interpreted by others. Having a place refers to the need for personal space, which motivates individuals to control their surroundings and invest in them. Stimulation drives individuals to use, care about, and maintain objects. Thus, people are motivated to achieve stimulating needs and meet awakening requirements [58–61].\n\nMany factors influence the formation of PO. These factors influence not only the formation of PO and work characteristics but also the company culture, attitude of high-level managers, company’s goals and vision, and reputation of the company [62]. A common vision conveys an organization’s members’ common goals and ambitions for the organization [29, 63]. Moreover, it represents the organization’s vision, mission, and core values [64, 65]. Thus, when a company promotes sustainable development and formulates a GSV, this expresses to employees the goal and value of their efforts and strengthens their personal ownership and PO of the target green product. Chiu et al. [62] proposed that a company’s goals and vision affect PO. Moreover, according to Chang [35], GSV contributes to GPPO. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 3 (H3).\n\nGSV is positively associated with GPPO.\n\n# 2.3.2. Effect of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC) and Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)\n\nPO affects individuals’ attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Furthermore, PO causes a person to exhibit a stance, sense of responsibility, and self-concept beyond the norms [66]. When an organization’s members have PO for their organization, they tend to exhibit more responsibility for their roles, take greater care of the organization, and adopt a protective attitude toward the organization [67]. Moreover, they may be willing to take risks or make personal sacrifices for the organization [59] and the subject matter of PO [59]. When members of an organization have PO for a certain subject matter, they may exhibit positive attitudes toward the organization [68]. Research has indicated that PO is an important predictor of the status of members of organizations [56, 58, 66, 69, 70]. Studies have indicated that factors such as the work performance and satisfaction of work can be predicted by organization-based PO [58, 59, 71, 72].\n\nThe PO of green products can predict individuals’ organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35].
