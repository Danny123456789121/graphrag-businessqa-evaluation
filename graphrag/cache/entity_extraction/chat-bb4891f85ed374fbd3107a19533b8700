Accordingly, everyday events should be addressed to assess corporate social performance. Second, all previous studies focus on few industries (particularly the petrochemical firms) which are prone to extreme events, while all firms should be involved. Specifically, the stock market impact of CSR in services or for high-tech companies is largely ignored, whereas these industries represent a large and growing part of the economic activity. Lastly, the tremendous development of social networks and the speed by which they spread information makes any ordinary event a potential market mover. In the case of Moncler (mentioned supra), it seems that the fall in stock prices has been triggered by algorithmic trading following an avalanche of negative tweets against the company.\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firm value on a day-to-day basis has received little scrutiny so far. A first attempt was made by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). In their seminal study, they consider companies listed on the Nyse or the Amex over the period 1985â€“1991 and examine 22 environmental negative events (oil spill, gas leak, explosion and other incidental pollution) and 140 positive ones (environmental awards) extracted from the Nexis database. On average, negative events yield significant abnormal returns of -1.5% ($0.70 per share), whereas positive events lead to significant abnormal returns of 0.82% ($0.37 per share).\n\nThereafter, some papers have examined the market reaction to CSR awards and certifications (Jacobs et al. 2010; Lyon et al. 2013), CSR rankings (Takeda and Tomozawa 2008), CSR stock index redefinitional (Capelle-Blancard and Couderc 2009; Oberndorfer et al. 2013), voluntary corporate initiatives (Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011; Yu 2012) or the release of standalone CSR reports (Yu et al. 2013). These papers, however, consider positive news only and secondhand information; they are limited by the small size of their sample, and they are not really suitable to determine what are the key factors influencing shareholders.\n\nMore recently, Flammer (2013) has extended the approach initiated by Klassen-McLaughlin with a sample of 117 eco-friendly events and 156 eco-harmful events extracted from the Wall Street Journal over the period 1980â€“2009. Unsurprisingly, she finds that announcements of eco-harmful corporate behavior lead to negative abnormal returns (-0.65%) and that eco-friendly corporate initiatives generate positive abnormal returns (0.84%). She also provides additional interesting insights. Her results suggest that companies have been increasingly penalized for irresponsible behavior toward the environment over time and that shareholders of firms with stronger environmental performance react less negatively to the announcement of eco-harmful behavior. Yet, this paper focuses on a single dimension of CSR, considers only major events and is still limited by the small size of the sample.\n\nFinally, the only paper that examines the relationship between CSR and stock price with firsthand events on all CSR dimensions and with a relatively large database is Krueger (2015). This paper, which has been carried out in\n\nG. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit\n\nparallel, is the one whose approach comes close to ours. In his paper, he considers 2116 negative and positive ESG events concerning 745 different firms between 2001 and 2007. The data are extracted from the KLD database. The results confirm that negative news are followed by a stock price decrease, while the impact of good events is positive only in cases of poor stakeholder relations. One of its main contributions is the content analysis which shows that investors react more strongly to ESG news containing strong economic and legal information content.\n\nAll these results are appealing. However, the main drawback of most of these studies is the relative small size of the samples used. Indeed, they usually relied on hand collection and coding of news content, which automatically restricted the sample size. Consequently, most of the papers simply assess the market reaction following a specific event and cannot provide much detail. Very few papers provide evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or provide any comparison between heterogeneous events.\n\n# Hypotheses Development\n\nIt is virtually impossible to open the business section of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, or any business publication today without seeing mention of measures being taken by some company to become more â€˜â€˜socially responsibleâ€™â€™. â€“ Paul R. Portney (2008)\n\nIn the media, stories about CSR have become very frequent over the past decade. This statement is confirmed by Fig. 1 which reports the number of occurrences for the wording â€˜â€˜corporate social responsibilityâ€™â€™ in the newspapers. The query is based on online archive collections provided by Dow Jones Factiva (it covers all major newspapers and publications in the world; that is, more than 10,000 news sources including major publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, etc.). Both in absolute terms (the raw number of occurrences) and in relative terms (as a percentage of the number of articles which mentioned the word â€˜â€˜financeâ€™â€™), the occurrence of the CSR concept is growing quickly, and now it is quite common.\n\nESG news are increasingly popular and newsworthy. Information on CSR is likely to make good stories, and it is reasonable to consider that soft news on ESG issues and the emotive language associated are more appealing for a large audience than hard information on companyâ€™s financial statements for instance.\n\nExtensive media coverage might also be explained by the fact that ESG news are â€˜â€˜blue-compatibleâ€™â€™. Empirical evidence suggests that Democrats (the â€˜â€˜bluesâ€™â€™), in contrast to Republicans (â€˜â€˜\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
