The median and mean ESs are 0.015 and 0.016 that can be interpreted as having very small ES according to Table 1. This result is consistent with many existing papers (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Humphrey et al., 2016). They find no significant difference in the performance of SRI and conventional funds in the US market, even though they examine different samples and time periods. The distribution of ESs is not normal since skewness and kurtosis are significantly different from normal distribution.\n\nThe first result of interest in our meta-analysis is the overall value of ESs that allows us to judge the impact of SRI on investment performance. In order to calculate the weighted ES, we use the reciprocal of variance of each comparison. Table 4 shows weighted ESs from running fixed and random-effect models. The weighted ES from the fixed-effect model is 0.068 and is statistically very significant. Although this result clearly indicates that the influence of SRI is negative to portfolio performance, it can be interpreted as having a very small effect economically.\n\n# Table 3 Descriptive statistics of effect sizes\n\nThis table shows distributive characteristics of ESs calculated from 205 comparisons. The figures in parentheses are p-values. *** indicates statistical significance at the 1% level.\n\n|N|Min.|Median|Max.|Mean|Std|Skewness|Kurtosis|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|205|1.516|0.015|2.449|0.016 (0.611)|0.455|1.004 (0.000)***|12.755 (0.000)***|\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# C.-S. Kim\n\n# Table 4    Weighted effect size\n\nThis table shows weighted ESs and its 95% confidence interval from fixed- and random-effect models. It also reports test statistics for the appropriateness of using the random-effect model, Cochran’s Q or I2 statistic. *** represents statistical significance levels at the 1% levels, respectively.\n\n|Fixed-effect model|Random-effect model|\n|---|---|\n|Weighted ES|Weighted ES|\n|0.068***|0.061|\n|Conﬁdence interval|Conﬁdence interval|\n|0.075|0.011|\n|0.031|0.054|\n\nHeterogeneity chi-squared = 4058.62*** (d.f. = 204) p = 0.000\n\nI2 (variation in ES attributable to heterogeneity) = 95.0%\n\nTest of ES = 0 : z = 18.16 p = 0.000\n\nTest of ES = 0 : z = 0.51 p = 0.607\n\nAccording to Table 1. Besides, the test statistic to judge between the fixed- and random-effect models, Cochran’s Q, strongly suggests that the random-effect model should be used in order to control heterogeneity among different studies. The value of I2 indicates that 95% of total variance is caused by between-study heterogeneity.\n\nFor the random-effect model, the variance used to calculate weight is the sum of within-study variance and between-study variance. In Table 4, the between-study variance is reported as s2, 0.0764, which is quite large. Unlike the result of the fixed-effect model, the weighted ES from the random-effect model is positive in sign, but the size is negligible and lacks statistical significance. This result largely supports Hypothesis 1 and is consistent with the evidence in many empirical papers on SRI (Sauer, 1997; Bello, 2005; Kreander et al., 2005; Bauer et al., 2007; Gregory and Whittaker, 2007).\n\nAlthough the overall ES is not significantly different from zero, ESs can be systematically different depending on the moderators. We first report the results for moderators associated with sampling issues and proceed to present the results for moderators related to methodological issues. Predictions for moderators and empirical results are summarized in Table 2.\n\n# 5.2.    Results on Sampling Issues\n\n# 5.2.1.    Time.\n\nTable 5 shows AESs and ESs in each decade from the 1970s. ESs are very positive in the beginning. The SRI movement has been initiated by social activists and religious groups who emphasize various merits of SRI. However, the initial positive atmosphere has weakened as more firms engage in CSR activities and SRI performance undergoes more rigorous scrutiny by many researchers and investors, leading to a smaller SRI impact over time. In addition, the impact of SRI tends to decrease.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\n# Table 5 Changes in the absolute value of effect sizes\n\nThis table reports descriptive statistics for the changes in the absolute value of ESs and ESs themselves through decades.
