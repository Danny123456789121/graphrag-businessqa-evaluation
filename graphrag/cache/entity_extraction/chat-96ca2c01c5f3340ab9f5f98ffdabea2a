Smets et al. (2015) explore how insurers balance the contradictory relationship between market logic and community logic. They find that only the segmentation practice needs to be bridged, that bridging leads to demarcating, and that demarcating is confirmed again as a method to minimize this contradiction and maintain logical clarity. Therefore, these three mechanisms follow a circular.\n\n# Luo et al. Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\n# Resulting Downstream Effects\n\n# Multi-Paradox\n\nOrganizational paradox theorists have categorized organizational paradoxes into various types. For example, Feldman and Pentland (2003) depict the tensions in organizational routings as stability vs. flexibility, Waldman and Bowen (2016) identify the tensions between agency and communion in leadership practice, and Besharov (2014) argues that there are relational tensions between managers and frontline employees. To understand the nature of paradoxes better, a more nuanced typology has been developed. Here, the authors keep with the widely accepted four-type categorization, namely, performing, learning, organizing, and belonging paradoxes, following Smith and Lewis (2011). While the sustainability paradox can be any combination of these four types of paradoxes, the authors contend that the performing type is most fundamental to understand the sustainability paradox. A performing paradox arises from competing goals, demands, and strategies, such as the simultaneous pursuit of economic, social, and environmental goals (Hahn et al., 2018). Most existing research on the sustainability paradox focuses on the performing paradox.\n\nSome other researchers have also looked at multiple types of sustainability paradoxes. For example, the co-existence of a social mission and economic goals can involve various types of paradoxical tensions. First, an organizing paradox emerges when firms hire and socialize employees (Battilana and Dorado, 2010; Battilana et al., 2015), or (re)design their organizational structure (Battilana et al., 2012; Stadtler, 2018) and legal forms (Haigh and Hoffman, 2011; Battilana et al., 2012). Second, a belonging paradox occurs when organizational actors have opposing values, beliefs, or identities while confronting and resolving a set of competing goals (Phillips and Tracey, 2007; Battilana and Dorado, 2010; Smets et al., 2015; Demers and Gond, 2020). For example, employees conceptualize their roles differently in CSR activities (Seivwright and Unsworth, 2016). Third, a learning paradox could be salient since success in sustainability requires both short-term and long-term efforts (Midttun, 2007; Hahn, 2009; Pache and Santos, 2013).\n\nHowever, in articles that identify multiple types of sustainability paradoxes, regardless of how the authors classify the types, they tend to simplify the complexity underlying the simultaneously co-existing paradoxes. Instead, the existing literature has concentrated on certain types of paradoxes (mostly the performing paradox), and/or discussed the identified paradoxes separately. This separation tendency could constrain our understanding of the sustainability paradox’s intricate nature. A few exceptional studies have appeared recently. For example, Vallaster et al. (2020) adopt a comprehensive framework to investigate how dynamic capabilities affect various paradoxes differently. Winkler et al. (2020) show how agonistic rhetoric solves performing, organizing, and belonging paradoxes jointly. Therefore, the authors conclude that the complex relationships between various types of sustainability paradoxes, Theoretically, proactive responses to organizational paradoxes could lead to sustainable outcomes. In the short term, individuals, teams, and organizations are likely to display excellence through enhanced learning and creativity, flexibility and resilience, and stimulated potential, which would pave the way for long-term success (Smith and Lewis, 2011).\n\n# Short-Term Effects\n\nA body of research has empirically proved that proactive strategies could lead directly to tension mitigation. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) reveal how contradictory elements could co-exist, alleviating tensions and bringing benefits in daily work at the same time. The proactive shift toward agonistic rhetoric helps the organization to transcend tensions and to foster CSR (Winkler et al., 2020). Proactive strategies could also facilitate knowledge creation. Bolton and Landells (2015) suggest that the knowledge base created during the process of management–stakeholder interaction could further generate the power that impacts business vision. While Hahn et al. (2014) theoretically propose that sustainability challenges stimulate creative insights, Calic and Mosakowski (2016) prove that a sustainability orientation improves the innovation of entrepreneurs’ final projects. Wry and York (2017) also show that entrepreneurs who navigate dual logics have greater possibility of proactively integrating these and developing creative business models. Gümüsay et al. (2020) regard this resilience as the ability the organization gains from the adoption of a proactive mechanism to avoid permanently suffering the loss or being estranged. This can help the corporation to perceive and correct a tendency toward deviation and to handle emergencies.\n\nSome researchers have discussed how the management of the corporate sustainability paradox affects corporate legitimacy. For example, sustainability efforts (Calic and Mosakowski, 2016) and paradoxical thinking (Scherer et al., 2013) could enhance and maintain the legitimacy gained from collective awareness and value (Dart, 2004). Moreover, organizations could obtain other instant benefits, such as corporate credibility (Schneider and Clauß, 2020), greater market engagement (Kannothra et al., 2018; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020), and competitiveness (Fosfuri et al., 2016) by positively reacting to sustainability paradoxes, which would contribute to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
