For example, generative AI can produce unusual and illogical responses such as fictitious references (Thorp 2023) and unintentionally biased output for users (ChatGpt and Demir 2023). In the financial sector, false data generated by generative AI can lead to problematic model training, mislead decision-makers, and trigger huge losses. The inability to identify the possible illicit objectives of AI users can accelerate the spread of false information by unscrupulous individuals using ChatGPT influences investor sentiment and decisions, increases market uncertainty, and heightens volatility. Mann et al. (2023) suggest that fake output from LLMs should be deleted promptly. In addition, when analyzing and predicting company financial and industry data, it should be noted that generative AI predictions and recommendations are based on historical data and cannot predict unexpected events. Therefore, excessive reliance on generative AI-automated forecasts and recommendations may lead to unwise investment decisions, and investors may suffer significant losses.\n---\n# 5.3 Regulations\n\nMoral and legal concerns regarding the use of generative AI necessitate regulations in the financial sector, as discussed in Section 5.1. We asked Microsoft Bing’s chatbot about the ongoing development of a regulatory framework for generative AI. There is no legislation specifically designed to regulate the use of generative AI, except for the AI Act being finalized by the European Union. The proposed legislation focuses primarily on strengthening rules surrounding data quality, transparency, human oversight, and accountability.\n\nThe second limitation is that generative AI is sensitive to changes in the prompt template. Replies to questions that have the same meaning but are phrased differently can be quite varying. Worse still, the same content entered in different generative AI chats can produce distinct results. People should be particularly cautious when using generative AI to create numerical features. We provide some cases to illustrate this drawback. In Figure 4, we asked ChatGPT 3.57 to generate text readability scores for financial news published by Reuters on 10 June 2023. The scores were set to a range of 0 to 1, with 0 indicating the lowest level of the text readability. We find that ChatGPT 3.5 generated different outputs based on the same inputs, which is caused by the access to different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) between different ChatGPT chat boxes. It is therefore essential to apply appropriate strategies to overcome the sensitivity of the prompt.\n\nWe then tried setting the ‘temperature’ of generated readability score equal to 0, which resulted in more consistent numerical outputs. Using the ‘temperature’ (randomness) setting for generated content may be preferable when the user needs to generate a specific number. For users who pose an open-ended question, such as a request for a comment, it would be better to use a setting that allows a wider range of creative responses. Using an API is another way of modifying the creativity and stability of generated content, but it requires programming skills and fees for use.\n\nThird, although challenging, it is important to use generative AI efficiently. For example, ChatGPT, the most widely used generative AI today, can only provide 25 answers in three hours, which would not meet the demands of many financial institutions. Meanwhile, only a few users can access ChatGPT plugins, which may limit the Internet community’s ability to develop more AI applications (OpenAI 2023b). Furthermore, unlike New Bing, which is available to people worldwide, OpenAI is not available in certain regions, such as Saudi Arabia and China. Addressing these limitations requires efforts to improve the efficiency of AI systems, increase their accessibility, and promote equitable access to AI technology. Failing to do so could impede the diffusion of knowledge and exacerbate inequalities in the distribution of intellectual resources across countries. An example of the current bias in generative AI is that ChatGPT is better at understanding content written in English than text in other languages (Seghier, 2023). Recognizing and mitigating bias in generative AI systems is essential for ensuring fair and inclusive outcomes. Finally, given the rationality of machines (Constantinescu et al. 2022), it is unlikely that generative AI will make suggestions with loving care, especially given the prevalence of harmful gender stereotypes. This limitation needs to be considered when using generative AI for human interactions or sensitive matters.\n---\n# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES\n\n# 19\n\n(1) The generated numerical value is 0.525.\n\n(2) The generated numerical value is 0.632.\n\n(3) The generated numerical value is 0.25.\n\n(4) The generated numerical value is 0.303.\n\nFigure 4.
