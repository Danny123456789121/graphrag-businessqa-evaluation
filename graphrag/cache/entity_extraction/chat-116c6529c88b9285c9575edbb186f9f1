Results\n\nIn this section, the computational results of FCM, Entropy weight and VS-TOPSIS is present as below, respectively.\n\n1. The cluster matrix in FCM was built on the survey data from experts. Then Eq. (1)-Eq. (4) can be used to compute the transitive closure matrix. In this study, the frequency of self-composition square was eight, and λ = 0.858 was adopted in this study for acquiring a proper clustering result. Accordingly, Table 2 reveals that these 21 SRM criteria was clustered into six categories, thereinto, C1-C4 was clustered into the aspect of economic, C5-C8 fall into the aspect of environment, C9-C12 belongs to the aspect of society, C13-C15 was included in the aspect of socio-economic, C16-C18 was considered in the aspect of eco-efficiency, C19-C21 was covered in the aspect of socio-environment.\n2. After scraping the social media data based on Python software, these accumulated frequencies must be transferred into the corresponding entropy weight by means of Eq. (5)–(8). Specifically, Appendix A shows the calculated entropy weight of 21 criteria and 6 aspects.\n3. The expert group was consisted of 5 professors, 10 senior managers and 10 senior engineers who had more than 5 years of work or research experience in Chinese automobile industry. Each expert was required to fill out two questionnaires so as to generate the qualitative assessment matrix and the hesitant matrix, respectively. Additionally, all the linguistic preference must be integrated with the corresponding hesitancy index in order to convert them into unified vague value in contrast with Table 1 in using Eq. (9). Table 3 presents the transferred vague set assessment matrix, taking the interrelationship from C3 to C1 as an example, the detailed transformation process is [0.7 − 0.7 ∗ 0.3, 0.7 + 0.7 ∗ 0.5] = [0.550, 0.850].\n4. Utilizing Eqs. (10)–(17) to compute the profit ratio matrix. Then, the aggregated matrix S can be obtained through aggregating all the individual proration matrix in using Eq. (18), as shown in Table 4.\n5. Once the aggregated profit ratio matrix is obtained, the decision matrix can be derived and normalized by adopting Eq. (19) and Eq. (20), respectively. The entropy weight is integrated to weight the normalized\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
