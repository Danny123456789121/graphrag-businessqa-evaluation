Governance Sub-criteria.\n\n# Product Responsibility\n\nUnder the Product responsibility (PR) category, we obtained the following sub-criteria ranking: PR4>PR3>PR5>PR2>PR1, as presented in Figure 8. Product research and development (PR4) is seen as a challenge in supporting the development of corporate sustainability infrastructure, with a score of 0.4102. The next sub-criteria that received the highest score is the compliance with products and policies (PR3) category, with a weight of 0.3297. Product complaint mechanism (PR5) received a score of 0.1737, being the third most important sub-criteria. Following this, indirect impacts of the product (PR2) reached the fourth position (within Product Responsibility category) with a weight of 0.1321. The fifth most important sub-attribute came from the personal impacts of product use (PR1) with a weight of 0.0952. Then, the first phases of product-innovation processes, as well as decision-making processes, must address a sustainability perspective in order to introduce a sustainability paradigm into the business’s practices. Additionally, organizations must incorporate a long-term perspective when considering sustainability as a strategic asset for businesses [98].\n\n# Transparency and Communication\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107. Transparency of general reports (TC4) reached the first position in the Transparency and Communication category, showing a score of 0.4321. Moreover, strategic perspectives after transparency of general reports (TC3) is in the second position, reaching a score of 0.3487. Following, commitments to the community (TC1) and alignment of commitments (TC2) are ranked at the third and fourth.\n\n# Personal impacts of product use-PR I\n\n0.0952\n\n# Indirect impacts of product-PR2\n\n0.1321\n\n# Product complaint mechanism-PRS\n\n0.2575\n\n# Compliance with products and policies-PR3\n\n0.3297\n\n# Product research and development-PR4\n\n0.4102\n\npositions, obtaining a score of 0.2175 and 0.1564, respectively. Finally, ethics and citizenship (TC5) are considered the least influencing sub-criteria with a score of 0.1324. Thus, sustainability supports knowledge creation and sharing, which, in turn, eases communication within organizations. To make a proactive sustainability strategy realistic, Kim and Ji [99] suggested that corporations aiming for a proactive sustainability strategy must consider the communication of a shared vision within an organization and among the company’s stakeholders. When companies communicate their visions related to sustainability, they improve their reputation which increases stakeholders’ interests in such organizations. Moreover, Dyllick and Muff [100] stated that corporate sustainability mission and vision statements should be adopted to convey corporate commitment throughout the corporation. Then, top managers have to consider sustainability goals in the company’s core values in order to align the company’s motivations, strategic goals, and responsibilities related to customers, employees, and society, as well as stakeholders. Companies need to address sustainability due it inspires commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.\n\n# Transparency and Communication\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107.\n\n# Transparency of general reports (TC4)\n\nreached the first position in the Transparency and Communication category, showing a score of 0.4321.

Firstly, risks and the management of economic and financial performance (ECO4) has a weight of 0.4932, whereas CSR and sustainability activities expenditure (ECO2) are ranked in the second position with a score of 0.4321. Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development. Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.\n\n# Economics\n\nThe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate governance refers to the systems and processes by which companies are directed and controlled, focusing on the relationships among the management, board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Product responsibility involves the ethical and legal obligations of companies to ensure their products are safe, comply with regulations, and meet consumer expectations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transparency and communication in organizations refer to the practices that ensure stakeholders are informed about the company's operations, decisions, and performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sustainability in business refers to the ability to operate in a manner that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, often involving environmental, social, and economic considerations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Economics in the context of corporate governance refers to the study of how businesses manage resources, costs, and financial performance, particularly in relation to sustainability efforts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Corporate governance frameworks often incorporate sustainability principles to ensure long-term success and accountability to stakeholders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Product responsibility is a key aspect of sustainability, ensuring that products are developed and managed in an environmentally and socially responsible manner<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Transparency and communication are essential for promoting sustainability initiatives and engaging stakeholders effectively<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECONOMICS<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Economic considerations are critical in assessing the viability and impact of sustainability strategies within organizations<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
