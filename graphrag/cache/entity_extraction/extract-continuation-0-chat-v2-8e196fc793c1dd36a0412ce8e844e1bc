In contrast, with their awareness of multiple and conflicting economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame develop more ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues; as a consequence, they adopt a prudent stance, where they consider more comprehensive responses, but because of their higher awareness of risk and tensions, they move forward slowly and carefully.\n\nAs our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making by considering the effects of alternative cognitive frames on the sensemaking process of sustainability issues. Our examination of the differences in content and structure of managers’ cognitive frames offers a more sophisticated understanding of the responses to sustainability issues they consider. We offer testable propositions on the effects of the two frames on managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. Our argument results in a cognitive explanation for why managers— owing to the predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames—rarely push for radical change in the face of the immense challenges that sustainability presents. More generally, our plea to consider a greater cognitive diversity contributes to a better understanding of how managers make sense of ambiguous issues that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.\n\nWe organize the article as follows. We first develop the business case frame and the paradoxical frame with regard to their content and structure. We then develop propositions on how the two frames influence managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues, as well as on the most important factors that moderate these effects. In concluding the article we discuss key implications and offer avenues for future research.\n\n# COGNITIVE FRAMING AND MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING\n\nDecision makers operate in turbulent organizational contexts with complex and ambiguous signals. According to cognitive categorization theory, individuals use cognitive heuristics to make sense of such complex situations (Mervis & Rosch, 1981; Rosch, 1975). As complexity increases, sensemaking shifts from being perception based to being category based, since people’s “cognitive processing becomes schema-driven . . . and they . . . assign a handful of their direct perceptions to types, categories, stereotypes, and schemas” (Weick, 2010: 541). Correspondingly, research on managerial cognition suggests that managers interpret and make sense of ambiguous and complex signals.\n\n# 2014\n\n# Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge\n\nthrough cognitive frames (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). A cognitive frame is a “mental template that individuals impose on an information environment to give it form and meaning” (Walsh, 1995: 281). These frames are produced and reproduced by individuals through labeling objects and situations according to observed attributes.\n\nBecause human rationality is bounded, managers do not achieve a complete understanding of strategic situations; rather, they use cognitive frames to “develop subjective representations of the environment that, in turn, drive their strategic decisions and subsequent firm action” (Nadkarni & Barr, 2008: 1395). Through cognitive frames managers reduce complexity and ambiguity by selectively organizing and interpreting signals from the organizational context (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). At the same time, cognitive framing occurs “on the basis of past learning and categorization” (Mervis & Rosch, 1981: 89) and, thus, is self-referring and retrospective, which results in a confirmatory bias that directs attention toward signals that fit existing frames and away from signals that are inconsistent with these frames (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Hence, cognitive framing can also limit decision makers’ understanding of a situation since it “may encourage stereotypic thinking; subvert controlled information processing; fill data gaps with typical but perhaps inaccurate information; prompt one to ignore discrepant and possibly important information; discourage disconfirmation of the existing knowledge structure; and inhibit creative problem solving” (Walsh, 1995: 282).\n\nFollowing Walsh (1995), we distinguish between the content and the structure of a cognitive frame. Cognitive content “consists of the things he or she knows, assumes and believes,” while cognitive structure denotes “how the content is arranged, connected or studied in the executive’s mind” (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996: 57). The content of a cognitive frame relates to a particular domain, such as corporate strategy making (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994) or entrepreneurship (Shepherd, 1999). Within a domain, frame content captures a person’s ascription of attributes to objects and events, where an “attribute is any basis a person uses to distinguish or group objects and events” (Scott, Osgood, & Peterson, 1979: 36). Attributes that serve to differentiate objects and events into categories are said to have high cue validity (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). With regard to the structure of a cognitive frame, Bartunek, Gordon, and Weathersby suggested that the two primary dimensions are “differentiation—the ability to perceive several dimensions in a stimulus array—and integration—the development of complex connections among the differentiated characteristics” (1983: 274). Differentiation captures the number of elements within a frame, and integration describes the degree of interconnectedness among these elements (Walsh, 1995). Taken together, structure and content of a particular cognitive frame lead to a particular interpretation of a situation and, in turn, to a particular managerial response (Tikkanen, Lamberg, Parvinen, & Kallunki, 2005).\n\n# COGNITIVE FRAMING IN MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING ON SUSTAINABILITY\n\nCorporate sustainability “refers to a company’s activities . . . demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders” (van Marrewijk\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COGNITIVE FRAMING<|>EVENT<|>Cognitive framing is a mental template that individuals impose on an information environment to give it form and meaning, influencing managerial decision making.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING<|>EVENT<|>Managerial decision making involves the processes and actions taken by managers to make strategic choices in complex and ambiguous situations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability refers to a company's activities that demonstrate the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and interactions with stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGERS<|>PERSON<|>Managers are individuals who interpret and make sense of ambiguous and complex signals in organizational contexts, using cognitive frames to guide their decisions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGERS<|>MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING<|>Managers engage in managerial decision making, utilizing cognitive frames to interpret complex situations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING<|>COGNITIVE FRAMING<|>Cognitive framing influences the process of managerial decision making by providing mental templates for understanding complex information<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Managerial decision making is crucial for addressing sustainability issues within organizations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>COGNITIVE FRAMING<|>Cognitive framing affects how managers perceive and respond to sustainability challenges<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
