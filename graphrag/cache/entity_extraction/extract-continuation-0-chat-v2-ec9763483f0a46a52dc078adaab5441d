For this sub-sample, we do not find indications to support the learning hypothesis. Although the dispersion of effects, positive and negative alike, increase since the beginning of the 1990s, the aggregated picture stays unchanged. Besides simple observations of the regression line, the time-invariant relation is supported by various trend tests which all fail to detect a time-dependent change of the correlation factors for every year since the mid of the 1990s (Figure 8).\n\n# Discussion\n\nBoth vote-count and meta-analytic studies yield comparable results. This is a surprising outcome since the underlying studies are comprised of nearly independent samples (12.9% overlap) and apply different methods. Both methods yield robust results which reinforces the claim that there is a business case for ESG investing. On the one hand, the effect size-transformed vote-count results do not overestimate effect sizes for our sample and lead to comparable results measured as correlation r in comparison to the meta-analytical studies (r = 0.146 vs. mean correlation in meta-analyses between 0.108 and 0.169). Vote-count studies produce, on the other hand, more modest estimates for determining the proportion of positive and negative findings compared to meta-analyses. The share of neutral/mixed results is potentially overestimated for vote-count studies. Vote-count reviews determine whether the effect per study is significant by narrowly focusing on the underlying primary study sample size. Meta-analyses, by contrast, average effects across the entire sample of underlying studies which reduces the meta-analytical mean variance. Smaller variances mean lower thresholds (lower correlations) for significance in meta-analyses.\n\nWhile overall correlation averages between 0.108 (r = ) and 0.169 (p = ) could be considered rather “small” (Cohen 1988, 1992), they reflect common effect sizes in social sciences (Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota 2003; Tamim et al. 2011; Lipsey et al. 2012) and, notably, might have relatively high relevance for competitive global securities markets. Based on correlation factors and the distribution analysis of more than 2000 empirical studies, we feel confident in generalizing that ESG criteria and CFP are, on average, positively correlated.\n\nThe distinct positive empiric result is found across various approaches, regions, and asset classes – except for portfolio-related studies. This outlier is potentially the source of the widespread misperception on the ESG–CFP relation. Institutional and private investors typically conclude that the ESG–CFP relation is, at best, neutral – consistent with the neoclassical understanding of capital markets (Markowitz 1952; Fama 1970; Friedman 1970; Fama 1991). Such an assumption about the ESG–CFP relation can be a key barrier for the broad uptake of sustainable investing among investors and investment advisors (Paetzold and Busch 2014; Reynolds 2014; CFA Institute 2015; Paetzold, Busch, and Chesney 2015).\n\nThe realized performance in portfolios depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell et al. 2001; Luo and Bhattacharya 2009), on construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley 2002), and on costs for portfolio implementation (Carhart 1997; Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano 2009) which may distort pure ESG performance. Indeed, we find a significant difference in correlation levels of portfolio and nonportfolio studies. We argue that ESG portfolios should be expected to exhibit lower correlations to CFP and less positive findings for the following three reasons: (1) following the “drowned out by noise” argument (Peloza 2009), various overlapping market and nonmarket factors in a portfolio tend to\n\ncover potentially existing ESG alpha. (2) Most ESG funds constitute a mixture of so-called negative and positive ESG-screened funds, which could result in distortion and cancellation of any remaining effects (Derwall, Koedijk, and Ter Horst 2011). (3) Only studies on portfolios (in particular mutual funds) embed management fees and other costs such as performance fees and trading costs. Observed effects in firm-specific study designs are typically calculated without such fees and costs. As roughly 2.5% per annum in various fees are carried by the average mutual fund (Carhart 1997; Barber, Odean, and Zheng 2005; Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano 2009), real correlation patterns in portfolio studies are most likely distorted. We conclude that portfolio-study findings have to be treated as a specific outcome of a subgroup within the entire ESG–CFP discussion. Investors, on average, are unlikely to harvest the existing ESG alpha after implementation costs. However, it can be argued, sophisticated investors are more likely to do so (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980; Hoepner 2013; Nagy, Kassam, and Lee 2015). Thus, our results underpin previous findings: at the worst case, investors in ESG mutual funds can expect to lose nothing compared to conventional fund investments (Hamilton, Jo, and Statman 1993; Humphrey and Tan 2014; Revelli and Viviani 2015).\n\nRegional findings reveal that within developed markets, there is a higher share of positive results from North America compared to Europe and Asia/Australia. This can partially be explained by the lower share of portfolio studies\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ESG INVESTING<|>EVENT<|>ESG investing refers to the practice of considering environmental, social, and governance factors in investment decisions, which has implications for performance in global securities markets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>CFP stands for Corporate Financial Performance, which is a measure of a company's financial health and performance in the market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>GEO<|>North America is a region that shows a higher share of positive results in ESG investing compared to Europe and Asia/Australia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is a region that has a lower share of positive results in ESG investing compared to North America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA/AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Asia/Australia is a region that has a lower share of positive results in ESG investing compared to North America.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESG INVESTING<|>CFP<|>ESG investing is positively correlated with Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), indicating that companies with strong ESG practices tend to perform better financially<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>ESG INVESTING<|>North America has a higher share of positive results in ESG investing, suggesting a stronger correlation with Corporate Financial Performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPE<|>ESG INVESTING<|>Europe has a lower share of positive results in ESG investing compared to North America, indicating a weaker correlation with Corporate Financial Performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIA/AUSTRALIA<|>ESG INVESTING<|>Asia/Australia has a lower share of positive results in ESG investing compared to North America, indicating a weaker correlation with Corporate Financial Performance<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
