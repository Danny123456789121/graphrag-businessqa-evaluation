However, this difference is small and fails statistical significance (p-value of the difference is 0.388). Thus, Hypothesis 2a is rejected. Opposite to a common notion in the literature, our findings propose that good CSP pays, whether social or environmental related.\n\nWithin CSP dimensions, CSP reputation yields the highest relation (pb i = 0.318). The difference to the group average of CSP measures of b̿p = 0.225 is significantly higher at the 99% level (z-value 2.66). However, when we adjust for the 0.80 reliability factor (Table 4, column 12), CSP reputation is marginally adjusted towards pbir = 0.299 to account for the second-order sampling error. Thus, we confirm Hypothesis 2b: reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP within the CSP dimensions.\n\nCSP disclosure yields significantly lower correlations (pb i = 0.119) compared to the group average (b̿p = 0.225) at the 99% level (Table 4). On account of the high level of variance artifacts (1-ProVar = 0.58), an adjustment for the second-order sampling error reveals the final, potentially true, correlation level birp supported. Within CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP, including second-order sampling error.\n\nT. Busch and G. Friede = 0.181) vs studies = 0.163.
