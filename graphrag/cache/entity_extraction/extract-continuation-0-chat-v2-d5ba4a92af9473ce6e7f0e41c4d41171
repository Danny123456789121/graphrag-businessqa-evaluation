Engelberg and Parsons (2011), who examine earning announcements in the USA show also that the impact of media on ﬁnancial markets is inﬂuenced by the distance. Accordingly, we investigate whether the proximity between a company and where the event takes place inﬂuences the impact of ESG news on shareholders behavior and ﬁrms’ market value.\n\n# H 11\n\nThe impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger for local events or for more proximate geographi- cally or culturally events.\n\nThe next sections will present the procedure used to test these assumptions, and how we proxy the main character- istics of the targeted corporations and the features of the news that may shape investors’ sentiment and inﬂuence the impact on stock price.\n\n# A Two-Step Hypotheses Testing Procedure\n\nTo test our set of hypotheses, we investigate the extent to which ESG news affect ﬁrm’s stock price. We proceed in two steps (as King and Soule 2007; Capelle-Blancard and Laguna 2010; Flammer 2013; Krueger 2015). First, we\n\n# G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit\n\nassess the direct impact of ESG news on stock prices using the event study methodology. Then, we aim to determine whether certain characteristics of the news or the firm might explain stock price variations.\n\n# The Event Study Methodology\n\nEvent studies examine the behavior of stock prices around corporate events. This methodology is widely used to measure shareholders’ reaction to all kinds of unexpected news (Kothari and Warner 2006). The underpinning of event studies is the efficient market hypothesis (Fama et al. 1969), which states that as new information becomes available, it is fully taken into account by shareholders. Accordingly, stock price changes reflect, to some extent, the discounted value of current and future firm’s cash flows. In practice, the basic idea is that shareholders’ reaction to a specific information can be measured by comparing the observed return to the return that we would expect in absence of any firm-specific event; this difference is called the “abnormal return.” If investors react (un)favorably to an event, we would expect (negative) positive significant abnormal returns. The strength of this approach is that it is based on the overall assessment of many investors who quickly process all available information in assessing firm’s market value. Moreover, this approach reduces reverse causality concerns which might appear when one examines the correlation between CSR and accounting measures of firm performance, such as profits.\n\nFormally, we follow the approach defined by MacKinlay (1997) and consider the Market model (augmented with a sectoral index) to predict returns. Hence, for each event, abnormal returns are computed as follows:\n\nARij;s;t = Rj;s;t - E(Rj;s;t) = Rj;s;t - bj - bjabRm;t - bRs;tcj\n\nwhere ARij;s;t measure the shareholders’ reaction to the event i targeting the firm j, which belong to the industry s, at time t. Rj;s;t is the observed return for the firm j, Rm;t is the corresponding market return and Rs;t the corresponding sectoral return. The parameters aj, bj and cj are estimated over a 60-day window ([-70, -11]).\n\nAs usual, abnormal returns are aggregated over (2n + 1)-day periods around the event: n days before to catch possible insiders information, the day of the event and n days after. It leads, for each event, to cumulative abnormal returns (for n = 1; ...; 5):\n\nCARij;s;t[n; +n] = Σs=t-n ARij;s;s\n\nTo test hypotheses 1, 2 and 3, we separate ESG news between good news and bad news and according to the source (media, firms and NGOs). Then, for each category, we compute average abnormal returns (AAR = ARi) and cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR[n; +n] = CARi[n; +n]) and use statistical analysis to test the significance of our results (see MacKinlay, 1997). Stock market data are from Datastream.\n\n# Regression Specification\n\nIn addition to assessing the direct effect of ESG news on stock price, we aim to determine whether certain characteristics of the event or the firm affect abnormal returns. To this end, we use a regression-based approach. Specifically, we estimate the following model:\n\nCARij;s;t[n; +n] = a + b Trendt + C0Xi + K0Yj;t + dj + hs + ei;j;s;t\n\nwhere CARij;s;t[n; +n] is the cumulative abnormal return for the event i, occurring at the date t, targeting the firm j, which belongs to the industry s, over a centered (2n + 1)-day window (Eq. 2). Trendt is a linear monthly trend. Xi is a vector of variables related to the event and Yj;t is a vector of variables related to the targeted firm at time t. dj and hs are firm and industry fixed effects, respectively. ei;j;s;t is the error term. We use White heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The coefficients of interest are b, C and K which capture the characteristics related to hypotheses 4 through 11. Definition and sources of the variables are presented in the next section.\n\nAlternative specifications (with or without the sectoral index or with the CAPM) lead to very similar results. The most serious concern is about confounding events.
