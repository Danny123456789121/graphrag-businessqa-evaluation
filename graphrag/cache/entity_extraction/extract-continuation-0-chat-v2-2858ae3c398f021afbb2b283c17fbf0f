Second, this indicates that out-\ncome-based CEP also positively inﬂuences external evaluations of\na ﬁrm and may entail reputational effects (reﬂected by market-\nbased measures). Hence, this ﬁnding suggests that the market does\nindeed value CEP in terms of accomplished environmental impact\nreductions (Konar & Cohen, 2001). A recent example for the market\ninterest in outcome-based CEP is the Carbon Disclosure Project\n(CDP), denoted as ‘‘the most powerful green NGO you’ve never\nheard of’’ (Winston, 2010), which is tracking the greenhouse gas\nemissions of major companies worldwide. The establishment of\nthe CDP goes back to an international initiative of institutional\ninvestors, presently having $78 trillion under management.\n\nWith regard to process-based CEP, we found a positive relation-\nship for subsequent accounting-based CFP but not for subsequent\nmarket-based CFP. This ﬁnding is somewhat surprising. As con-\ntended by the NRBV, the relationship between CEP and CFP in-\nvolves the development of resources and organizational\ncapabilities, which in large parts are of rather intangible nature\n(e.g., reputation, human resources, or organizational culture).\nTherefore, market-based measures of CFP were suggested to be\nmore capable of considering the intangible effects of CEP (e.g.,\nBaird et al., 2012; Delmas & Nairn-Birch, 2011). Moreover, several\nscholars emphasized the rather long-term value creation potential\nof environmental processes (e.g., Hillman & Keim, 2001; Kim &\nStatman, 2012; Lankoski, 2008), which is more likely to be cap-\ntured by market-based CFP. One possible explanation refers to\nthe fact that environmental processes do not always lead to im-\nproved environmental outcomes (Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Xie &\nHayase, 2007). For example, research has highlighted that the\nimplementation of environmental management systems (referring\nto process-based CEP) does not guarantee ecological success in\nterms of outcome-based CEP (Nawrocka & Parker, 2009). In some\ncases environmental processes may even constitute merely a sym-\nbolic gesture without meaningful and substantial implications\n(Delmas et al., 2013; Wagner, 2008; Walker & Wan, 2012). Thus,\nour ﬁnding that process-based CEP does not inﬂuence subsequent\nmarket-based CFP, while outcome-based CEP does so, suggests that\nthe market rewards ﬁrms’ environmental performance if pertain-\ning to objective and quantiﬁable results but not if pertaining to\nenvironmental processes, which might be considered as less reli-\nable measures or even as ‘‘green-washing’’ attempts (Busch & Hoff-\nmann, 2011). The positive impact of process-based CEP on\nsubsequent accounting-based CFP, on the other hand, may result\nfrom successful internal efforts such as altered production pro-\ncesses, which go along with direct cost savings that are not appar-\nent to the market or for some reason (e.g., overlapping effects of\nother market-related incidents) are not reﬂected in investors’\nperceptions.\n\nWith regard to the causal direction from CFP to CEP, we found a\nsigniﬁcant relationship between prior accounting-based CFP and\nprocess-based CEP. This conﬁrms the slack resources hypothesis\nproposing that ﬁnancial resources are necessary for environmental\nprocesses (e.g., the redesigning of production processes or substi-\ntution of polluting inputs). However, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al.

Also, we did not find a significant relationship between prior accounting-based CFP and outcome-based CEP. The former finding, in our view, is not surprising and may be due to the fact that accounting-based measures, with their rather internal focus and their backward-looking nature, better proxy for organizational slack than market-based measures. The latter finding might be explained again by the fact that process-based CEP does not necessarily lead to improved outcome-based CEP. Therefore, there might be cases in which high CFP firms use their resources for mounting environmental processes that do not effectively affect environmental outcomes.\n\nWhile the findings discussed so far referred to studies allowing the establishment of causal inferences, most of the studies examining the relationship between CEP and CFP unfortunately draw on concurrent measurement for both constructs. Regarding this type of studies our findings revealed positive relationships for all subgroups. Furthermore, both process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP are more strongly related to concurrent accounting-based CFP than to concurrent\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is an international initiative tracking greenhouse gas emissions of major companies worldwide, aimed at promoting environmental accountability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Management Journal is a publication that features research articles, including studies on corporate environmental performance and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
