This table shows the results from Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis for the CEP–CFP relation. Data are split according to the number of lagged years j between the two constructs. n is the number of studies, and k is the number of effect sizes. Besides, the random‐effects mean effect sizes and their standard errors are shown. Because mean correlation coefficients are accepted as remarkable in meta‐analysis when they exceed 0.10 (Cohen, 1992), mean correlation coefficients are highlighted in a bold font when they are equal to or larger than 0.10. CEP: corporate environmental performance; CFP: corporate financial performance.\n\naDue to the small number of observed effect estimates, the calculations cannot be performed completely for this subgroup.\n\n*Significant at 10% level; **Significant at 5% level; ***Significant at 1% level.\n\nbe desirable from the perspective not only of the stakeholders but also of the firm itself, to invest financial slack more wisely. In contrast, our results confirm that if a firm proactively increases CEP, it may achieve long‐term economic benefits starting after 2 years, as proposed by the Porter hypothesis (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). Due to the time lag resulting from the development and realization of environmental innovations induced by environmental regulation, the positive financial effects delay. In the same way, firms might profit in the long term from additional knowledge and resources as proposed by the NRBV (Hart, 1995) as well as from enhanced stakeholder relations following the instrumental stakeholder theory (Davis, 1973) and the social impact hypothesis (Latané, 1981). As a robustness test, all HOMA results are recalculated using z‐transformed effect sizes. As presented in Table 2, the results remain stable.\n\n# 4.2 Publication bias test\n\nIn order to examine the robustness of our results, we perform a publication bias test as routinely employed in meta‐analysis. As a first graphical impression, we consult the so‐called funnel plots. Therein, the effect sizes (partial correlations r) are plotted against their precision (1/SE (r)). As an example, Figure 2 shows the funnel plots of the effect sizes measuring the relation between CEP and CFP for the different major (sub)samples. An unbiased sample should lead to a symmetric‐inverted funnel, indicating that the deviations of the single effect sizes from their mean value decrease with an increasing precision of their estimation. Figure 2 tends not to reject this hypothesis, as effect sizes are quite symmetrically distributed around the mean effect sizes. Solely for the last subsample of effect sizes measuring CFP as lagged independent variable, effect sizes are slightly underrepresented on the left side. However, this might be reasoned by the small sample size but could also be an indicator of publication bias.\n\nFor a more objective test of publication bias, we perform the Egger test (Egger et al., 1997) for all subsamples of effect sizes, for which a mean effect size is calculated. The results are displayed in Table 3. Accordingly, there are no significant effects, which point to the presence of publication bias. Solely for the full subsample of effect sizes measuring CEP and lagged independent variable, the publication bias test reveals an estimate of 1.142, which is weakly significant at the 10% level. Hence, the choice of time lag is no means for selective reporting of results. Overall, the analysis provides no evidence for publication selection bias.\n\n# 4.3 Robustness test and of heterogeneity\n\nAs already noted, hitherto unobserved heterogeneity (as incorporated in the random effects component τ2 in previous analyses) is present in the field of the CEP–CFP relation. This is also empirically confirmed by the statistically significant heterogeneity\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
