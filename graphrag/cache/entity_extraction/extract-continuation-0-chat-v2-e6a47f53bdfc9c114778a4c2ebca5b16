These findings are also consistent with Cohen, Pant, & Sharp (1998), who provide evidence that women display a higher ethical sensitivity – i.e., they are more likely to identify a questionable action as unethical, and less likely to engage in that action. In addition, Hillman (2015) argues that innate differences between men and women can improve board functioning, and Lee and\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nFarh (2004) find that diverse groups are more innovative and identify a broader set of alternatives for consideration, improving decision-making efficacy. Hence we expect both financially- and socially-motivated activists to campaign for increased gender diversity.\n\nHowever, we expect that socially-motivated activists would have a higher benchmark for what they view as an “acceptable” level of female representation, as achievement of their social legitimacy goals would presumably require more than the token presence of a female director. To illustrate, consider a board with, say, 14 percent female directors, which is the average level of representation for S&P 1500 firms in 2013. This level of representation may be deemed as adequate by financially-motivated activists, but would fall short of the more ambitious goals of 20 percent or 30 percent female representation that have been set by advocacy organizations such as 2020 Women on Board, Catalyst of the Thirty Percent Coalition. In this instance, we would expect socially-motivated activists to still target firms for improvement if that firm had a level of “only” 14 percent representation, but financially-motivated activists may not bother because this level may be adequate in terms of achieving the monitoring benefits that gender diversity provides to firms. In other words, we expect higher existing levels of female representation for socially-motivated than for financially-motivated activists. If this is the case, then the predicted inverse relation posited in H1a will be weakened for socially-motivated activists and strengthened for financially-motivated activists. Stated formally:\n\n# Hypothesis 1b.\n\nThe effect of existing levels of female board representation on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.\n\nOur second hypothesis considers whether the existing degree of board independence influences the likelihood that a firm will be targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. Sonnenfeld (2002) argues that board members should be able to challenge other’s assumptions and beliefs to resist the often-strong pressure to conform with\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Janis (1972) argues that a group is especially vulnerable to “groupthink” when its members are similar, and that increased diversity improves the problem. Similarly, Milliken & Martins (1996) find that diversity reduces “groupthink”, status quo bias, and other group-based decision biases, and Schwartz-Ziv (2015) finds that CEOs are more likely to be held accountable if the board includes a critical mass of women directors. Carter et al. (2003) find that the percentage of women directors is negatively associated with the number of company insiders; similarly, Kang, Chang, & Grav (2007) report that gender diversity is positively associated with board independence in Australian firms. Because women are more likely to be independent directors – outsiders to the firm but also less similar to male board members – shareholder activists concerned about a lack of board independence may encourage greater gender diversity as an indirect means of improving independence. An alternative view is that shareholders concerned about increasing board independence could pursue that goal directly without resorting to an indirect route involving gender diversity. Also, Ertimur et al. (2011) find that activists target firms with more independent boards with compensation-related proposals. We nonetheless predict a negative relation between board independence and the likelihood of being the target of a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. Stated formally:\n\n# Hypothesis 2a.\n\nHigher existing levels of board independence reduce the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity.\n\nWe again consider how activist motivation might affect this relation. Under the agency theory perspective, it is assumed that independent boards are more effective at monitoring managers and aligning their interests with those of shareholders. For example, Carleton, Nelson, & Weisbach (1998) find that TIAA-CREF views board diversity as a corporate governance issue because they believe that a diverse board is less likely to be beholden to management, hence alleviating potential agency problems within the firm.\n\n(2002) finds that board independence is negatively associated with earnings management, which suggests that independent boards are more effective in monitoring the corporate financial reporting process, and Carter et al. (2003) document a positive relation with board independence and firm value as measured using Tobin’s Q. We therefore expect that financially-motivated activists, who are typically governed by agency concerns, to have a strong preference for board independence. From an institutional theory perspective, however, board independence is not typically a matter of social legitimacy; thus socially-motivated activists would be less driven by this concern. We thus predict that the association between board independence and the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is intensified for financially-motivated activists than socially-motivated activists. Stated formally:\n\n# Hypothesis 2b.\n\nThe effect of existing levels of board independence on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financial\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>2020 WOMEN ON BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>2020 Women on Board is an advocacy organization that aims to increase the representation of women on corporate boards to 20% or more.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALYST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Catalyst is a nonprofit organization that works to accelerate progress for women through workplace inclusion and diversity initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THIRTY PERCENT COALITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Thirty Percent Coalition is an organization focused on achieving a minimum of 30% women on corporate boards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HILLMAN (2015)<|>PERSON<|>Hillman is a researcher who argues that innate differences between men and women can improve board functioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COHEN, PANT, & SHARP (1998)<|>PERSON<|>Cohen, Pant, & Sharp are researchers who provide evidence that women display higher ethical sensitivity in corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEE AND FARH (2004)<|>PERSON<|>Lee and Farh are researchers who find that diverse groups are more innovative and improve decision-making efficacy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SONNENFELD (2002)<|>PERSON<|>Sonnenfeld is a researcher who argues that board members should challenge assumptions to resist groupthink.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANIS (1972)<|>PERSON<|>Janis is a researcher who discusses the vulnerability of groups to \"groupthink\" when members are similar.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILLIKEN & MARTINS (1996)<|>PERSON<|>Milliken & Martins are researchers who find that diversity reduces groupthink and decision biases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHWARTZ-ZIV (2015)<|>PERSON<|>Schwartz-Ziv is a researcher who finds that CEOs are more likely to be held accountable if the board includes a critical mass of women directors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARTER ET AL.
