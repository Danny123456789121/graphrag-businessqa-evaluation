Building energy performance indicator in kwh/m2/year is used.\n- Environmental management system (Env3): The level of effort to reduce environmental impact is measured by an environmental management system certification (ISO 14001) (https://nbs.net/p/3-ways-smes-can-tackle-iso-14001-70c12e6b-8c15-428b-9c15-c248f08cf098). ISO 14001 has a progressive approach that breaks down the certification process into three successive levels.\n- Employment practices (Soc1): This critical criterion defines the total commitment of a potential partner regarding employment. It refers to the level of temporary workers in this study.\n- Health and safety (Soc2): Partners in the sustainable supply chain should aim to improve activities by minimizing health and safety incidents and implementing security practices to enhance the quality of life for employees. Number of incidents per year per 1000 employees is considered to evaluate the supplier.\n- Responsibility to stakeholders and community (Soc3): Funds given by a supplier for educational, charitable purposes and to support community projects and social programs could be considered when evaluating suppliers in terms of social responsibility.\n\n# 3.2. Initial Criteria Evaluation and Causal Diagram Construction\n\n# 3.2.1. AHP for Sustainability Dimension Weights and Hierarchical Structure\n\nAHP is one of the most popular MCDM methods. One study found that the technique is used as a standalone approach in around 19% of supplier selection studies [33]. The basic concept of AHP is to cluster the data into smaller groups and, using pairwise comparison, weight elements at each level.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\nIt measures the decision-maker’s preference for one criterion over another by assigning a numerical value to the preference levels [34]. AHP is used to initially construct the BN model as a hierarchical structure. AHP assumes that criteria, at the same level of a hierarchy, are independent. In this study, the AHP for estimating the weights of selected criteria are summarized as follows:\n\n# Step 1: Modeling the sustainable supplier selection problem as a hierarchical structure.\n\nWe model the supplier selection problem as a hierarchical structure including a goal to evaluate the supplier at the first level, sustainable dimensions at the second level and criteria at the third level. Nine criteria, summarized in Section 3.1, are assumed to be the most relevant sustainability criteria; this set is suggested by firm decision-makers and has been incorporated into this study.\n\n# Step 2: Constructing the judgment matrices.\n\nWe construct the judgment matrices (CMs) for each level via pairwise comparisons with respect to the goal of selecting a sustainable supplier. The decision-maker (DM) preferences are based on comparing pairs of factors and are represented using a linguistic scale (equal importance = 1, somewhat important = 3, strongly more important = 5, very strongly more important = 7, extremely more important = 9, intermediate values = 2,4,6,8). A reciprocal value depending on the direction of preferences between pairs of factors populates the remaining portions of the matrix.\n\n# Step 3: Computing the vector of criteria weights.\n\nA pairwise comparison is a n × n real matrix where n is the number of criteria. Each entry αjk represents the preference weight of the jth criterion relative to the kth criterion. If αjk > 1, the jth criterion is more important than the kth criterion and vice versa. αjk and αk j follow the constraint:\n\nαjk × αk j = 1 (1)\n\nA normalized pairwise comparison matrix norm is derived from CM. Each entry αjk is computed as:\n\nαjk = ∑l=1n αjkαlk (2)\n\nAn “n” dimensional column vector, the criteria weight vector ω, is built by averaging each αjk:\n\nωj = ∑l=1n αjlln (3)\n\nThe calculation is completed using MATLAB software. The consistency is evaluated using the consistency ratio (CR) suggested by [34].\n\nBy applying AHP to the case study, the relative importance of each pair of elements is prioritized using input from three case company decision-makers as experts. These managers include a purchasing manager (DM1), a logistics manager (DM2) and a supply chain director (DM3). They jointly completed a questionnaire of the possible pairwise comparisons. The comparison matrices (CMs) are constructed along the sustainability dimensions and sustainability criteria levels.\n\n# Table 2. Matrix results for criteria level.\n\n|Economic Criteria (ECO)|Eco1|Eco2|Eco3| | | | | | | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | | |Env1|Env2|Env3| | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | |Soc1|Soc2|Soc3| | | | | | | |\n| |1|1/3|5|1|5|3|1|1/5|1/3| | | | | |\n| |3|1|3| | |1/5|1|3|5|1|5| | | |\n| | | | | | |1/5|1/3|1|1/3|1/3|1|3|1/5|1|\n\nSome revisions of judgment with the decision-makers (DMs) were necessary as some matrix consistency ratios exceeded 0.1.
