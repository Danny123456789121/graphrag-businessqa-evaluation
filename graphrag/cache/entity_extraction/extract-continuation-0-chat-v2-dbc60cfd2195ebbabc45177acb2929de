Initial hierarchical causal graph.\n\n# 3.3. Defining the States and Parametrizing the Bayesian Network Model\n\nBNs are network probabilistic models based on Bayes’ theorem and can be utilized for decision support. Bayes’ theorem considers prior probabilities about events and develops predictions based on new information. The fundamental property of BN can be simply explained as follows [36]: realized, ∑j=1n P(Sj) A set of disjunctive events is considered S = {S1, S2,..., Sn}, where one of them is = 1. Sj ∩ Si = ∅, i, j = 1, 2..n, i , j. The event I is observed, which can occur only under the condition that some of the events Sj, j = 1, 2,.., n have already occurred. Then, the conditional probability of event Sr,j given that the event I has already been realized, is calculated using expression (10):\n\nThe occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of others\n\nP(Sr/I) = P(Sr)P(I/Sr) = ∑j=1n(Sj)P(I/Sj)P(Sr)P(I/Sr) (10)\n\nwhere P(S) is the probability of event S, i.e., the starting or an a priori probability. P(I) is the probability of event I. P(I/S) is the probability of event I, given that event Sj has occurred (conditional probability). P(S/I) is the probability of an event Sj given that event I has occurred (revised or a posteriori probability).\n\nA BN begins with a graphical structure which is composed of nodes and arcs. Nodes represent events and arcs represent direct causal relationships between events. If there is an arc from event A to B, this means that event A is a parent of event B, and event B is a child of event A. The causal relationship between events can be described in terms of conditional probabilities. A BN structure can be constructed using expert knowledge. This construction is not trivial, especially when multiple decision-makers are used. However, a generally accepted method to build BN structures with decision-makers does not exist.\n\nBNs are able of handling qualitative (poor/fair/good), Boolean (yes/no) or quantitative variables. Data representing these events are called states and may be derived from historical data, expertise or a combination of the two. The parameters of a BN are encoded in node probability tables (NPT). Each node has an associated NPT that defines the conditional probability distribution of that node conditioned on its parents.\n\nAfter defining the states for each criterion, the BN parameters are determined using a ranked nodes method.\n\nThere are two types of variables used in the proposed BN model:\n\n• Qualitative variables have ranked responses with five ordinal states including very low, low, medium, high and very high for dimensions and criteria levels. These variables are represented by a ranked nodes method that reduces the number of parameters needed for each variable and simplifies the definition of NPTs for decision-makers. Ranked nodes assume a truncated normal (TNormal) distribution with a central tendency towards the probability of parent nodes due to a weighted function [ 24 ].
