These scales ask employees to rate their emotional attachment and loyalty to their organization. To measure the quality of leadership behaviour, a leadership behaviour questionnaire such as the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) could be used. This questionnaire measures leadership behaviour in terms of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles.|\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\n# 39\n\n# T A B L E 1\n\n# (Continued)\n\n|Questions|ChatGPT responses|\n|---|---|\n|Stage 4: Analysis|Assuming the suggested research design and measures are used, what are possible ways to analyse the resulting data? To analyse the data, multiple regression analysis could be used. The dependent variable would be employee commitment, while the independent variables would be quality of leadership behaviour and satisfaction with HR practices. Control variables such as employee demographics, job characteristics, and organizational factors would also be included in the analysis.|\n|Stage 5: Reporting of results|What best practices for reporting results of the previous analyses should be included regarding transparency? 1. Clearly state the research questions and hypotheses: This will help readers understand the purpose of the study and the specific relationships being examined. 2. Describe the sample: It is important to provide information about the sample size, demographics, and any other relevant characteristics that may affect the generalizability of the findings. 3. Report the measures used: This includes reporting the specific scales and items used to measure each construct, as well as information about their reliability and validity. 4. Present the results in a clear and understandable manner: This could include tables, charts, or graphs that summarize the findings in a way that is easy to interpret. 5. Report effect sizes: Reporting effect sizes, such as correlation coefficients or beta coefficients, can provide readers with information about the strength and direction of the relationships between the variables. 6. Report statistical significance: If statistical significance tests were conducted, it is important to report the p-values and the significance level used, so readers can understand the probability that the findings are due to chance. 7. Discuss the limitations of the study: It is important to discuss any limitations of the study that may affect the validity and generalizability of the findings.|\n\n# 5.2.2 Generative AI as a methodology assistant: Limitations\n\nChatGPT's critical limitation is its reliance on constrained training data resulting in “feast or famine” results: too many, too few, or too general. As of the writing of this article, ChatGPT relies on training data before 2022, includes limited access to academic articles, and is unable to collect new data. So, ChatGPT is beholden to the past and can only recommend doing things as they were before. If methods were used incorrectly, ChatGPT will nevertheless recommend repeating what has been done already making it particularly vulnerable to methodological myths and urban legends (Lance, 2011).\n\nOur case study illustrated several limitations of using ChatGPT as a methodology assistant, including too many suggestions, too few suggestions, and too general suggestions. First, for some questions, ChatGPT provided an abundance of responses (e.g., more than one measure for the same construct) that could lead to decision paralysis for junior researchers who may not know which response to choose or may be overwhelmed by the number of responses provided. Second, while ChatGPT has made significant advancements in natural language processing, it still has a limited contextual understanding of problems (Farndale et al., 2023) that could potentially limit the number of returned suggestions. For example, in the analysis stage, ChatGPT recommended multiple regression. However, multilevel modelling is more consistent with the measurement recommendation to collect data for constructs residing at different levels of analysis. Finally, regarding the suggestions about reporting, while ChatGPT's list of seven recommendations was comprehensive, they did not include enough specificity to apply to the particular context of our study fully. Similarly, suggestions about conducting ethical research were based on general and broad principles rather than specific and actionable recommendations, given our study's specific characteristics and context.\n\n# 5.2.3 Research directions and considerations of ethical research\n\nOur critical analysis of the capabilities and limitations of using generative AI as a methodology assistant led to several future research directions. First, our case study did not address qualitative research in particular. Thus, research is needed to understand generative AI's capabilities to assist qualitative researchers with, for example, transparency and replicability challenges (Aguinis & Solarino, 2019). Second, our analysis is based on ChatGPT's capabilities as of the writing of our article. We anticipate that future improvements will require additional evaluations. Third, future research can examine generative AI's capabilities and limitations when providing specific recommendations for statistical analysis for more specific contexts and situations. For example, to what extent does it offer useful and accurate suggestions on which specific assumptions are tenable and which specific models (e.g., fixed vs. random effects) should be implemented? Our case study is just the beginning of a research agenda aimed at understanding generative AI's capabilities and limitations as a methodology assistant.\n\nFinally, using generative AI as a methodology assistant raises unique ethical considerations. First, publishers and journals are now reaching a consensus on how AI's writing assistance should be acknowledged in submitted manuscripts (Eddleston et al., 2023; Elsevier, 2023). However, can generative AI help researchers address possible ethical dilemmas and trade-offs? What choices would ChatGPT make when asked about solving ethical dilemmas? Would it embrace\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
