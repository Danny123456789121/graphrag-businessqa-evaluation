Meta-analytical studies with nontransferable or nontransparent effect sizes that nonetheless allow a vote-count analysis were included in the vote-count studies sample as well. Focus “S” and “E” denote a Social (S) or Environmental (E) focus. For studies with combined E and S focus, the order of S and E indicates the relative weight of S vs. E. The labeling “E, S, G” indicates no relative weight within groups. The number of primary studies in each vote-count analysis is denoted N. For vote-count studies with transparent vote-count on primary study, the share of findings is calculated based on this primary information. For all other cases, the reported summary results of the vote-count reviewers are used.\n\nIn total, we identified 35 vote-count studies (Table 1) and 25 meta-analyses (Table 2) which combine results from 3718 (gross) primary studies of which 1816 studies stem from vote-count studies and 1902 from meta-analyses. All studies were scaled with a unique identifier in the format author 1, author 2, … , author i (year). Different review author citations formats, citations years of study versions, and author typing errors were normalized. All available statistical\n\n# Table 2.
