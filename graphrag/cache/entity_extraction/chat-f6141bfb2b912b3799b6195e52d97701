This focus on firm environmental performance leading to financial benefits for the organization continues to be explored in both the academic literature (e.g., Baker and Sinkula 2005; Christmann 2000; Clarkson et al. 2008; Coombs and Gilley 2005) and the business press (e.g., Engardio et al. 2007; Spaeder 2006; Tozzi 2008). Although results have been mixed, the majority of the research, including meta-analytic results (Orlitzky et al. 2003), suggest that indeed a positive relationship does exist between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).\n\nWhile establishing a link between CEP and CFP provides an important contribution, the specific boundary...\n\n# Corporate Environmental and Financial Performance\n\nConditions surrounding the relationship remain unclear. As a result, interest is growing in identifying relevant variables that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
