In addition, in emerging economies, the institutional environment often changes dramatically when local governments introduce various new laws and regulations (Chung & Beamish, 2005; Dileleman & Sachs, 2008). By building strong connections with governmental stakeholders, firms in transitional environments can use CSR to compensate for their shortcomings.\n\nGenerally, in East Asian developing regions where CSR is less predominant, the signaling role of CSR practices may turn into a powerful instrument for improving firms’ business performance. By comparison, stakeholders do not have to depend on signals sent from CSR to evaluate the organization, because there is a lot of information from different signals other than CSR in developed regions. Thus we posit:\n\n# Hypothesis 4\n\nIn East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in developing regions than in developed regions.\n\n# Industry setting: Manufacturing and service\n\nBecause diverse stakeholders will subject firms in different sectors to different pressures, industry effect is a crucial contextual factor in the relationship between CSR and business performance (Beurden & Gossling, 2008; Brammer & Pavelin, 2006; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Pressures arise because economic activities and social externalities are closely associated (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Satisfying constituencies’ demands for improved social responsiveness is also in the interests of companies because they depend on their stakeholders for the resources they need for continuing survival and success (Hillman & Keim, 2001; Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997).\n\nWe classified industry settings as either manufacturing or service industries. Service industries, such as education, banking, insurance, transportation, and retail, supply services to organizations and consumers. Manufacturing industries are involved “in the manufacturing and processing of items and indulge in either creation of new commodities or in value addition of materials” (Emmanuel and Oladiran, 2015: 137) and generate more pollution during production processes. Therefore, manufacturing firms are directly and closely related to environmental issues. That is, the CSR signals which are transferred by manufacturing firms tend to be green signals (Williamson, Lynch-Wood, & Ramsay, 2006). As we discussed above, stakeholders in East Asian regions attach more importance to environmental issues. So CSR signals sent by manufacturing firms can satisfy East Asian stakeholders more accurately and appropriately.\n\nIn contrast, service firms, being more environmentally friendly and less polluting, can send signals related more to social issues. While it is difficult for these social signals to attract stakeholders’ attention in East Asian regions. Consequently, service companies must be more socially and environmentally responsive to counter the externality problems they create, but generally find it more difficult to meet stakeholders’ requirements through formal legitimate CSR strategies (Williamson et al., 2006). Thus, we propose:\n\n# Hypothesis 5\n\nIn East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in manufacturing firms than in service firms.\n\n# Firm size: SMEs vs. non-SMEs\n\nFirm size shapes organizational behaviors and decisions, including CSR actions (Allouche & Laroche, 2005). Following Fang, Randolph, Memili, and Chrisman’s (2015) definition of SMEs, we classify firms as SMEs (small and medium enterprises with less than 500 employees) and non-SMEs (businesses with more than 500 employees). The diversity between sizes raises questions as to whether SMEs and non-SMEs benefit equally from CSR strategies (Godfrey et al., 2009; Sharma, 2000). We argue that SMEs will enjoy higher CSR value than will non-SMEs in East Asia.\n\nFirst, CSR signal is a better tool for SMEs to resolve information asymmetry. Most large companies now disclose information covering dimensions of CSR such as social and environmental performance, health and safety issues, and ethics. Large companies usually disclose more information than small companies (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006). In contrast, several East Asian SMEs, even without a website, do not have an appropriate way to deliver information to relevant stakeholders. The CSR signal is more valuable for SMEs because relevant stakeholders have limited information about SMEs and are difficult to evaluate firms’ CSR attitude. Second, SMEs suffer the liability of smallness; they need more external resources and legitimacy support than non-SMEs, and therefore they may gain significant advantages from CSR as long as their stakeholders perceive their CSR activities positively (Mackey, Mackey, & Barney, 2007; Siegel & Vitaliano, 2007). Third, SMEs can organize their CSR activities more flexibly because their internal decision-making processes are simpler and quicker (Hannan & Freeman, 1989). In contrast, non-SMEs may be less inclined to CSR activities because they have less need for external legitimacy, and their decision-making related to CSR strategy may be quite complex and relatively slow. Moreover, their large scale may cloud the relationship between CSR and business performance (Luo, 2006). As such, we posit:\n\n# Hypothesis 6\n\nIn East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in SMEs than in non-SMEs.\n\n# Organizational form: Private and public\n\nOrganizational form is another contingency that might impact the value of CSR to business performance (e.g., Dixon-Fowler et al., 2012). We classify organizations as either private or public.\n\nUnder the supervision of the public, public companies always disclose large amounts of information with respect to environmental and social issues in order to justify their existence, document their performance, and satisfy shareholders (Jenkins & Yakovlev\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
