Fama and French (2015) propose a five-factor model including the three Fama-French factors plus profitability and investment factors. However, we do not consider the five-factor model as four factors are enough to explain excess returns in a time-invariant specification, as shown by Gagliardini et al. (2019). By analogy with the fm,t factor, which is constructed based on the T-bill, we proxy the risk free rate with the 30-day T-bill beginning-of-month yield. The time series of European factors and the risk free rate are available on Kenneth French’s website.\n\n10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n# 5 Empirical analysis\n\nIn this section, we first compare greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio based on the models introduced in the previous section. Then, we propose an observable greenness and transparency factor defined as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio and those on the brown portfolio. Finally, we estimate the Greenium, i.e. the risk premium associated to the greenness and transparency factor, using a set of European individual stocks. Our sample spans from January 2006 to August 2018, covering all individual stocks included in the STOXX Europe Total Market Index (TMI) on August 2018.12 The STOXX Europe TMI covers approximately 95% of the free float market capitalization across 17 European countries.13 In principle, we could estimate our model on all 20K European listed firms. However, enlarging the sample would only marginally increase its coverage in terms of market capitalization, while it may jeopardize the results owing to the quality of the information that we would feed into the model. Indeed, the reliability of the data we use for our application crucially depends on the quality of environmental disclosures of European firms. On this matter, the NFRD imposes mandatory disclosures only on larger firms (with more than 500 employees). To be on the safe side, we construct our greenness and transparency factor based on a sample which is more reliable in terms of data quality, insofar as it is based on a market index, and still representative of the market as a whole. We present an application on a much larger sample in Section 6.\n\nAs in Fama and French (2008), we exclude financial firms (i.e., companies classified in sectors with NACE code K or L). The final dataset comprises n = 942 stocks. Stock returns and stock market capitalization data are sourced from Bloomberg. The panel is unbalanced, i.e., asset returns are not available for all firms at all dates. To account for publication lags, in each given year we use environmental disclosures for the previous reference year.\n\n# 5.1 Portfolio analysis and the Greenness and Transparency Factor\n\nAs described in Section 3, we distinguish between transparent and non-transparent companies. The former belong to set T while the latter belong to set Tc. At each month t, we define the returns on the transparent and non-transparent portfolios, i.e. ˜t and ˜c, respectively, as follows:\n\nrt\n\n˜t = ∑i∈Twiri,t,\n\n˜c = ∑i∈Tcwiri,t,\n\nwhere the weight is defined as wi = MCi,t/ ∑MCi,t, with MCi,t being the market capitalization of stock i at month t.\n\nFocusing on transparent firms, we study the returns on different portfolios characterized by different shades of green and degrees of transparency. In particular, we build portfolios of returns ˜q corresponding to the quintiles q = 1, ..., 5 of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator considering only firms belonging to the set T.\n\n12This allows us to avoid survivor bias in the data.\n\n13These are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe portfolio built on the fifth quintile includes top-ranked firms in terms of environmental performance and disclosures and is labeled ‘greener and more transparent’ portfolio. The returns on this portfolio are indicated as rt ˜g.\n\nFocussing on non-transparent firms, we build the brown portfolio by including companies in Tc which are active in one or more of the industries characterized by the highest emissions\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
