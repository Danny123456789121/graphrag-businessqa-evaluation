Accordingly, finance researchers seeking to publish in leading finance journals may be unaware of climate finance-related issues worthy of research attention. Among the leading finance journals, the two which are most practitioner-oriented have both published climate change-related articles. These are the Financial Analysts Journal (the Chartered Financial Analysts\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260\n\nInstitute’s journal) and the Journal of Portfolio Management. Proximity to finance practice, and in particular to institutional investors, may help support engagement with climate change. Indeed, in 2016 (beyond our sample period), there have been two notable climate finance risk-related publications in the Financial Analysts Journal, namely Andersson et al. (2016) and de Jong and Nguyen (2016). The five authors involved in these two publications were practitioners or practitioners with ties to universities. None were ‘conventional’ finance academics.\n\nSecond, finance is essentially a mono method discipline (applied empiricism encased in rational agent theory) which is ill-suited to tackling forward-looking challenges arising from dynamic system change (Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015; Focardi and Fabozzi 2012; Keasey and Hudson 2007). This ‘limited domain’ problem (Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015) may explain why the climate finance-related research that has been published in leading finance journals has tended to focus on carbon markets, as rich time-series datasets are readily available. If so, leading finance journals face fundamental epistemological challenges to remain relevant within the climate context.\n\nThird, incentives within finance research publication may steer academics away from climate finance topics. There may be a perception among finance academics that climate finance-related topics do not provide the opportunities for high impact general theory development that ‘core’ research in asset pricing, corporate finance and investments allows for and which tend to dominate the leading finance journals (see earlier discussion, and Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Further, established research agendas and high teaching loads among finance academics in universities may create inertia. There is high demand to study finance and a limited pool of faculty talent, partly as a result of alternative career opportunities in the finance industry. Thus, rather than undertaking ‘risky’ research in new fields such as climate finance that leading editors may not be receptive to, busy finance researchers focus on incremental knowledge in clearly recognised fields (Goodall 2008).\n\nFourth, and related to the previous points, researchers’ concerns that editors will not be responsive to climate finance topics may be well founded. This in turn may be related to leading finance professors (and journal editors) considering climate topics to be overly politicised (Goodall 2008). This effect may be accentuated by the US dominance of the finance discipline given the greater polarisation of views about, and scepticism towards, climate change in the US (Boussalis and Coan 2016; Painter and Ashe 2012; McCright and Dunlap 2011; Goodall 2008).\n\nTo explore this argument further, we identified the domiciles of the editorial teams of the 21 leading finance journals in our sample. We included co-editors, managing editors and executive editors but excluded associated editors. We assigned 0 (‘US’) or 1 (‘INT’) to a dummy variable coding for editorial teams that were exclusively US-based or that included at least one non-US domiciled editor respectively (see Appendix, Table 4). Of the 12 journals coded as international (INT), most included a combination of US and non-US editors reflecting the US dominance of the discipline. Only two journals had no US-based editors (Journal of Portfolio Management and Journal of Business Finance and Accounting). The phi coefficient of our dummy variable for all journals with at least one climate change-related publication and the INT dummy was 0.481 (significant at the 5% level). Leading finance journals publishing climate change-related research were categorised as having international editorial teams in all but one case (Journal of Futures Markets). We thus find a positive and statistically significant relationship between international editorial teams in leading finance journals and climate change-related research publications. This does not prove causality but does at least suggest that exclusively US-based editorial teams may play a role in limiting climate change-related research in leading finance journals.\n\n# 5 Conclusion\n\nRespected field journals such as Energy Economics have engaged strongly with climate finance-related research (Griffin et al. 2015). There are many climate finance initiatives in academia, including the Oxford Stranded Assets Programme and the new Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment, although tellingly the former is based in a geography department and the latter is not ranked by the business journal ranking lists (ABS 2015). So to be clear, we are not arguing that researchers are not engaging with climate finance. Rather, our concern is that elite business journals and leading finance journals have either not engaged at all or only engaged in a very limited sense. This has important implications for policy and practice.\n\nHigh-profile publications in leading journals are important both for impact and academic career progression. Finance research is no different. Indeed, rewards and prestige in finance research are particularly concentrated (Currie and Pandher 2011; Fishe 1998) in the three elite journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). As noted earlier, none of these journals published a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period of our sample. Emphasising their importance to the pursuit of knowledge generally, the three leading finance journals are placed among the top 100 journals in the world for all disciplines (according to 2016 SJR rankings).\n\nMeaningful action to understand and address the impacts of climate change on the financial system requires the engagement of the best minds\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Financial Analysts Journal is a leading finance journal published by the Chartered Financial Analysts Institute, which has published climate change-related articles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Journal of Portfolio Management is a prominent finance journal that has also published articles related to climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXFORD STRANDED ASSETS PROGRAMME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Oxford Stranded Assets Programme is an academic initiative focused on climate finance, based in a geography department.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment is a new journal dedicated to climate finance, though it is not ranked by business journal ranking lists.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY ECONOMICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Energy Economics is a respected journal that has engaged strongly with climate finance-related research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDERSSON ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Andersson et al. are authors of a notable climate finance risk-related publication in the Financial Analysts Journal in 2016.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DE JONG AND NGUYEN<|>PERSON<|>De Jong and Nguyen are authors of another significant climate finance risk-related publication in the Financial Analysts Journal in 2016.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAZ-RAINEY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Diaz-Rainey et al. are researchers who have discussed the limitations of finance research in addressing climate finance issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOCARDI AND FABOZZI<|>PERSON<|>Focardi and Fabozzi are researchers who have contributed to the discourse on finance's suitability for tackling climate finance challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEASEY AND HUDSON<|>PERSON<|>Keasey and Hudson are researchers who have examined the challenges of finance research in the context of climate change.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>OXFORD STRANDED ASSETS PROGRAMME<|>The Financial Analysts Journal has published climate finance-related articles, while the Oxford Stranded Assets Programme focuses on climate finance research<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT<|>Both journals have published articles related to climate change, indicating a shared focus on this topic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>OXFORD STRANDED ASSETS PROGRAMME<|>Both entities are involved in climate finance, with the journal focusing on sustainable finance and the programme on stranded assets<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENERGY ECONOMICS<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>Energy Economics has engaged with climate finance-related research, similar to the Financial Analysts Journal<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDERSSON ET AL.<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>Andersson et al. authored a notable publication in the Financial Analysts Journal related to climate finance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DE JONG AND NGUYEN<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>De Jong and Nguyen authored another significant publication in the Financial Analysts Journal on climate finance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIAZ-RAINEY ET AL.<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>Diaz-Rainey et al. have discussed the limitations of finance research in the context of climate finance, relevant to the Financial Analysts Journal<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOCARDI AND FABOZZI<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>Focardi and Fabozzi have contributed to discussions on finance's suitability for climate finance, relevant to the Financial Analysts Journal<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEASEY AND HUDSON<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL<|>Keasey and Hudson have examined challenges in finance research related to climate change, relevant to the Financial Analysts Journal<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
