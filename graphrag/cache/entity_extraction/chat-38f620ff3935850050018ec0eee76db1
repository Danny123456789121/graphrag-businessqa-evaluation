Section 2 provides a broad overview of the literature on the applications and limitations of generative AI in business and finance. Section 3 outlines the applications of generative AI in different domains within the business and finance sectors, using practical examples. In Section 4, we explore the potential of ChatGPT, a dominant LLM, to analyze corporate sentiment scores towards policy implementation. Section 5 discusses current ethical concerns and limitations of generative AI techniques and provides recommendations for regulating generative AI in finance and business for sustainable development. Section 6 concludes the article and identifies relevant areas for further research.\n\n# 2. Literature review\n\nAs one of the mainstream AI techniques, Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms have been used extensively in business and finance in the last few decades. Most of these studies leverage textual information, finding relationships between high-frequency texts and emerging trends. For example, Herzenstein et al. (2011) show that narratives significantly impact lending decisions by distributing different contextual information. Agarwal et al. (2016) find that the value of linguistic tone in credit rating action reports is closely associated with abnormal returns. Hassan et al. (2019) use an extended computational method for earnings conference calls to illustrate that firms’ political risks are closely related to their stock returns and investments. More recently, state-of-the-art NLP\n---\n# B. CHEN ET AL.\n\nAlgorithms, known as transformer models, have also been applied in business and financial studies (Korangi, Mues, and Bravo 2023; Stevenson, Mues, and Bravo 2021). Unlike traditional NLP models, generative AI can easily create interactions, generate designs, and even fabricate fake texts. For example, Brynjolfsson et al. (2023) demonstrate that generative AI does not require input instructions because it recognizes patterns from training sets. The preceding research has pointed out that the application of generative AI in business and finance is still in its infancy. Dowling and Lucey (2023) pioneer the use of the most widely used generative AI tool, ChatGPT, to generate ideas and identify data in financial research. Their findings suggest that researcher expertise and the level of data input can have an essential impact on ChatGPT output results; they also highlight the relative weakness of this technique in creating literature reviews. From the perspective of policy-related research, Hansen and Kazinnik (2023) investigate the ability of GPT and other advanced NLP models to decipher Fedspeak, or statements detailing the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve. Based on a human classification benchmark, their results suggest that GPT models performed the best. Concurrently, Yang and Menczer (2023) investigate whether ChatGPT can be used to determine the credibility of news outlets. Their results indicate that the ratings generated by ChatGPT are highly correlated with those of human experts. Furthermore, their results suggest that ChatGPT could be an affordable reference for credibility ratings in fact-checking applications. Beam (2023) points out that online surveys via chatbots are an attractive means of conducting surveys cost-effectively in global settings. In addition, chatbot surveys lead to higher disclosure rates on potentially sensitive topics.\n\nMost articles in the business and finance sectors have focused on the discussion of the prospects of generative AI (Ali and Aysan 2023; ChatGpt and Demir 2023; George, George, and Martin 2023; Lu et al. 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth 2022). For instance, Eckerli and Osterrieder (2021) provide an overview of how GANs generate financial data, summarizing their capabilities and limitations in current financial studies. The authors conclude that GANs have made substantial progress in financial applications and can be powerful tools for data scientists in this field. Lopez-Lira and Tang (2023) explore the potential of LLMs in predicting stock market returns using a sentiment analysis of news headlines, concluding that ChatGPT outperforms other NLP models and can improve the performance of quantitative trading strategies. Korinek (2023) summaries 25 cases in six areas (ideation, writing, background research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical derivation) where LLMs are becoming useful assistants and suggest that LLMs will greatly increase the productivity of microeconomics studies and produce economic models in the long term. As the most popular generative AI technique, ChatGPT shapes the way people interact with cutting-edge technologies (George, George, and Martin 2023). Dwivedi et al. (2023) review the relevant literature from experts in fields such as marketing, banking, and management, summarizing their views on the use of ChatGPT; they suggest that ChatGPT can offer significant benefits to financial institutions and promote business activities in these fields. In brief, there is a stream of literature on recent updates in technologies for processing textual information, such as the introduction of cutting-edge NLP algorithms, which provides insights into the discussions surrounding generative AI in the business and financial sectors.\n\nOverall, the application of generative AI in financial research is still at an early stage, while researchers’ expertise and data input can significantly impact the output results of.\n---\n# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES\n\nChatGPT (e.g. Dowling and Lucey 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth 2022).
