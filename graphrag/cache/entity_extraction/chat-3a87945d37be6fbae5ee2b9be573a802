Moreover, incorporating prior knowledge or physical background information into the model can also enhance its interpretability significantly.\n2. Explore Methods for Analyzing Model Interpretability. According to the characteristics of deep models, practical methods for analyzing model interpretability need to be explored. For example, by\n---\n# 5.2.7 Roadmaps for Edge Device Deployment\n\nDespite the impressive performance of LSF-Models, their computational demands significantly limit their applicability. In order to promote the application of LSF-Models in the field of PHM, the following aspects can be explored to make them lightweight.\n\n1. Explore Lightweight Deep Models. By exploring the design method of the lightweight deep model [291, 292] and developing new low-complexity algorithms and operator design paradigms, the computational load and resource usage of the model can be reduced.\n2. Model Compression and Pruning. Model compression [293, 294] and pruning [295, 296] techniques can be explored to reduce the model's size. Efficient compression methods such as weight sharing, low-rank decomposition, and knowledge distillation can be employed. Additionally, redundant neurons or connections can be eliminated using efficient pruning methods.\n3. Optimization of Network Topology. Explore new network topology design schemes, such as brain-inspired spiking neural networks [297, 298], to achieve deep network models with low power consumption and computational requirements.\n\n# 5.3 Prospect: Universal PHM Platform\n\nTraditional AI-based models for PHM typically require the development of unique data processing and model optimization algorithms for each subtask to achieve good performance in specific scenarios. For example, it is necessary to build independent fault diagnosis and RUL estimation models for bearings. However, complex industrial equipment may contain hundreds of core components, and it is a vast project to build corresponding PHM models for all components. In addition, this application paradigm cannot fully utilize the multimodal interrelated data of industrial equipment and cannot comprehensively characterize the health status of industrial equipment. Moreover, the various subtask models constructed are time-consuming and laborious and cannot guarantee that the model has good generalization. As mentioned earlier, the fields of NLP and CV, such as ChatGPT [62] and SAM [64], have demonstrated the fantastic performance of LSF-Models in cross-modal multi-task scenarios, and they have realized the idea of a model for all tasks to a certain extent. Therefore, inspired by this, it becomes possible to implement universal PHM platforms to\n---\nrealize one model for all PHM tasks. This research concept will completely revolutionize the research paradigm in the PHM field, and the realization of universal PHM platforms will significantly promote the comprehensive intelligence of the PHM field.\n\n# 6. Conclusions\n\nAt present, the research of deep learning is undergoing a new revolution, that is, the research paradigm (AI 1.0) of single mode, single task, and limited data is developing rapidly to the research paradigm (AI 2.0) of multimodal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model. AI 2.0 focuses on developing LSF-Models with cross-domain knowledge, which can show strong generalization and multi-task ability after training on massive datasets. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the three major technical\n\n# Fig. 10\n\nThe schematic diagram of the universal PHM platform, taking high-speed train PHM application as an example.\n\n|Fehicle Electrical System|Sensor Signal Data|Health Monitoring|\n|---|---|---|\n|Distribution Cabinet|Noise and Acoustic Signals|Fault Prediction|\n|Motor|Transformer, Multi-Modal Fusion and|CROSS-MODAL|\n|Gearhor Composite Video and Image Data|Anomaly Detection|Self-Supervised Algorithm|\n|Bogies and Axleboxes|Motor Vibration|Maintenance Plan|\n|Temperature Sensors|Work Orders|Health Management|\n|Axlebor Vibration and Temperature Sensors|Maintenance Records| |\n|Bogies and Axleboxes|Train Electrical System|Train Traction System|\n|Train Braking System|Trackside Monitoring System|Train Control System|\n|Expert Experience and Knowledge|Universal PHM Platform| |\n---\npoints of LSF-Models and analyzes the research status of LSF-Models in NLP and CV. The literature review shows a severe lack of research on LSF-Models in the PHM field, and there is no feasible solution for how to build LSF-Models for PHM applications. Therefore, this paper comprehensively answers how to build the LSF-Models suitable for the PHM field from four aspects: dataset, deep model, learning algorithm, and data fusion. Finally, this paper attempts to discuss the challenges and roadmaps of LSF-Models from a broader, more global perspective. Overall, this survey systematically introduces LSF-Models and their research status, challenges, solutions, roadmaps, and prospects in the PHM field, which is expected to provide valuable guidance for future research in this field.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\n1.
