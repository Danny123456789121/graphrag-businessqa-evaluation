For this component of the risk premium, the literature has proposed an interpretation linked to market imperfections (see, e.g. Daniel and Titman, 1997; Haugen and Baker, 1996). With reference to the Greenium, our hypothesis is that νg could capture alternative preferences of market participants, for example reflecting alternative expectations on future states of the economy (see Black and McMillan, 2006). In other words, some of the information that market participants have may not be fully captured based only on past returns. In this context, the difference between the investors’ larger information set and the smaller, backward-looking information set on which the model is estimated could be reflected in νk. This may be true in particular in the case of green and brown assets, in which case future perspectives may play a comparatively more important role than for other categories of assets.\n\n# Table 4\n\nThe table reports the estimated annualized premia λˆk and the cross-sectional estimator ˆk for the factors ν in the Carhart model and for the greenness and transparency factor.
