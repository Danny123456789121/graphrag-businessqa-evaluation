Board size is the total number of board members. CEO Duality is an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO also serves as the chair of the board, and zero otherwise. CEO on the Nominating Committee is an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO serves on the nominating committee, and zero otherwise. We measure female board representation (Female Representation) as the percentage of females on the board. The independence of the board of directors (Board Independence) is measured as the percentage of board members who are classified as independent. Board characteristics are obtained from RiskMetrics and financial data are obtained from Compustat. All independent variables are measured in the year prior to the target. Pearson correlation coefficients are reported, with significance levels in parentheses.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
