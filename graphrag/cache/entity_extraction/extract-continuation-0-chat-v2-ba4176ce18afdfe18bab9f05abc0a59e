Hence, all effect sizes reported in primary studies can safely be included in our analyses.\n\n# MASEM Procedure\n\nWe used meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM; Bergh et al., 2016; Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2011) to test our hypotheses. MASEM\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\ncombines the techniques of structural equation modeling with those of meta-analysis (Cheung & Chan, 2005). This technique allows us to analyze: (a) the direct effect of CSR on CFP, (b) the effect of CSR on firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity, and (c) the consequences of these mediating variables for CFP (Baron & Kenny, 1986). MASEM has two advantages over conventional meta-analytic techniques. First, not all specified relationships need to be included in each primary study, as each cell represents an independent accumulation of primary studies (Carney et al., 2011). Second, MASEM allows for the testing of research hypotheses that have never been tested in prior research, especially those connecting previously unlinked streams of literature (Bergh et al., 2016).\n\nMASEM involves a two-stage procedure (Bergh et al., 2016). First, a series of separate r-based HSMA analyses are conducted to construct a meta-analytic correlation table specifying the mean correlations between all independent, mediator, dependent, and control variables. This table is based on bivariate correlations, as partial correlations usually cannot be computed between the independent and control variables included in each primary research study. To deal with sample size differences, we based our analysis on the harmonic mean sample size (N = 3,704). The harmonic mean is less sensitive to outliers than the arithmetic mean, making it more appropriate for estimating correct and conservative t-values (Geyskens et al., 2006).\n\nIn the second stage, the meta-analytic correlation matrix is treated as the observed correlation matrix and subjected to structural equation modeling routines (Cheung & Chan, 2005). The data were analyzed using the full information maximum likelihood method with the LISREL 8.80 software package. To investigate whether a direct and significant relationship between CSR and CFP exists, and whether this relationship is mediated by our hypothesized variables, we estimated six nested models. We commenced with a model examining the direct relationship between CSR and CFP while controlling for prior firm.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The concept “Strategic CSR” features at the basic level, at which theoretical propositions are developed such as propositions about the causes and consequences of strategic CSR. At the secondary level, Strategic CSR is intensionally defined in terms of its causally most relevant properties, which in our case are identified by the four empirical mechanisms mediating between CSR and CFP: reputation enhancement, stakeholder reciprocation, risk mitigation, and innovation capacity. At the third, or indicator level of the conceptual structure, we extensionally define Strategic CSR in terms of observable empirical phenomena that operationalize the causally relevant properties by which Strategic CSR is defined. For each causally relevant property, we list three illustrative indicators (i.e. examples of CSR activities) that in our view are most likely to trigger this mechanism.\n\nThe reputation enhancing property of Strategic CSR, for example, captures visible and symbolically-laden CSR activities that may trigger positive attributions from existing and prospective stakeholders. Examples include affiliation with the United Nation’s Global Compact, announcing donations to charities, and voluntary CSR reporting.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n# Reciprocation Property of Strategic CSR\n\nReciprocation property of Strategic CSR denotes CSR activities that make a substantive contribution to the betterment of the firm’s existing stakeholders. Examples are adopting minority employment policies or family friendly HR practices and signing community benefit agreements. The risk mitigation property of Strategic CSR may involve incremental improvements in practices and processes such as waste reduction and pollution prevention, as well as the adoption of employee health and safety programs. Innovation capacity, finally, captures more comprehensive and transformative CSR initiatives. Potential indicators are public-private partnerships, investments in renewable energy, and base of the pyramid projects.\n\n# Hunter-Schmidt Meta-Analysis Results\n\nTable 2 presents the results for our r-based (left-hand panel) and rxy.z-based (right-hand panel) HSMA analyses pertaining to the CSR-CFP relationship. In addition to the meta-analytic corrected mean effect size (c), we report the number of samples (k), the cumulative sample size (N), the sampling error variation, the sample correlation variance, the estimated variance in population correlation, the 95 percent confidence interval around the (CI c 95%), as well as the p-value based on tests. The for the focal relationship is 0.07 (k = 1,466) and the rxy.z-based mean is 0.03 (k = 1,516). These means are somewhat smaller than those reported in prior meta-analyses (Margolis et al., 2007: 0.13; Orlitzky et al., 2003: 0.18).\n\nIn part, this is due to the fact that our study relies less on self-report data than earlier\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MASEM<|>EVENT<|>MASEM is a meta-analytical structural equation modeling technique used to analyze relationships between variables in research studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) is a measure of a company's financial health and profitability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LISREL 8.80<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LISREL 8.80 is a software package used for structural equation modeling and data analysis in research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARMONIC MEAN<|>EVENT<|>The harmonic mean is a statistical measure used to calculate averages, particularly in the context of sample sizes in research studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN GLOBAL COMPACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations Global Compact is a voluntary initiative to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOERTZ<|>PERSON<|>Goertz is referenced as an author who contributed to the concept formation approach in the context of Strategic CSR.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>CSR practices are analyzed for their direct effect on Corporate Financial Performance (CFP)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASEM<|>CSR<|>MASEM is used to test hypotheses related to CSR and its effects on various outcomes including CFP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASEM<|>LISREL 8.80<|>MASEM utilizes LISREL 8.80 software for structural equation modeling routines<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>UN GLOBAL COMPACT<|>Affiliation with the UN Global Compact is an example of a CSR activity that enhances reputation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOERTZ<|>CSR<|>Goertz's approach to concept formation is applied in the context of Strategic CSR<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARMONIC MEAN<|>MASEM<|>The harmonic mean is used in MASEM to address sample size differences in analyses<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
