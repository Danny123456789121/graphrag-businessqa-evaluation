This is not only the case for ChatGPT, but increasingly for all kinds of open-source software.\n- Imitation: This used to be the core of the RBV theory and especially for achieving a ‘competitive advantage through people’ (Pfeffer, 1994), and clarified by the conditions of ‘causal ambiguity’, ‘path dependency’ and ‘social\n\n# 2.2.3 | Open resource-based view: The positive perspective\n\nIn practice we are heading in the direction of increasingly openly available software, generating advantages and cost savings for all organizations, as well as for available workers for example, in areas of self-employment and the Gig economy (through digital platforms). Employee capabilities will be freely available and will no longer be protected by the firm in their role as employer through all kind of non-competitive and non-disclosure conditions.\n\nLet us first sum up some advantages from an HR-function perspective. ChatGPT can be very helpful in improving cost-effectiveness within HR. Think of activities such as composing job descriptions, screening of applications based on job requirements, preparing semi-structured interview questions, developing training programs and -materials such as course outlines and onboarding instructions. Also, the writing of policy documents such as those related to absenteeism, hybrid working, improving employee engagement can be ‘outsourced’ to ChatGPT, without incurring any additional costs and saving a lot of manpower hours and expensive rates from consultancy firms. This transformation could lead to temporarily competitive advantage of the first moving organizations and individuals.\n\nThe ‘outsourcing’ of HRM practices and HRM activities is not completely without risks, with respect to issues of:\n\n- Inaccurate or misleading information: Human judgement cannot be missed, as using ChatGPT might lead to misleading, outdated or wrong information.\n- ChatGPT and context: Neglecting or overlooking the context, might lead to a lack of contextual understanding of the specific business, with all kinds of negative consequences for the right answers and effective decision-making.\n- Outdated information: ChatGPT is built and trained on existing data. This implies that actual and future developments have not been considered. It is unclear to what extent ChatGPT and artificial intelligence in general can generate new insights and information by itself.\n- Bias and discrimination: Experiences from large firms, which reflect on their recruitment efforts using artificial intelligence or ChatGPT, warn for racial bias and a tendency against female candidates.\n- Privacy, Data security and GDPR: Data shared with the chatbot could potentially be exposed to unauthorized third parties or misused, resulting in data breaches or privacy violations.\n- Legal and ethical concerns: What are the legal and ethical implications of using artificial intelligence chatbots? Who owns the IP of generated content? Will there be national laws or sectoral regulations, which hinder or forbid the use of ChatGPT?\n\nThe summary of these potential risks can be considered ‘critical conditions’ for an alternative resource-based view approach to studying the impact of ChatGPT on SHRM. Increasingly openly available resources at the level of the individual, the organization and societal level will enable and intensify collaborative innovation and will allow individuals, organizations, and society at large to generate rents available to all. In this way we are heading in the direction of an open resource-based view of the firm to strategic human resource management being able to generate employee.\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 13\n\nwell-being, organizational efficiency, and societal well-being in line with the ultimate business goals or long-term consequences of the Harvard model (Beer et al., 1984):\n\n- Organizational effectiveness can be achieved through efficiency improvements and more focus on HRM services delivery given ChatGPT's ability to take over all kinds of HRM practices and activities of HRM professionals and line managers.\n- Employee well-being in multiple ways including (a) increased information availability, (b) direct knowledge sharing and (c) instant employee involvement through ChatGPT – human interface.\n- Societal well-being is achieved through open and broad sharing of information through ChatGPT.\n\nAn open resource-based view using ChatGPT can contribute to HRM knowledge sharing and knowledge circulation between organizations and between individuals including HRM professionals. Cocreation, knowledge sharing and knowledge circulation between different organizations could be an alternative way for achieving competitive advantage of the organizations involved (a multi-level and multi-sector perspective). Open resources can be part of collaborative innovation and even co-opetition (cooperation in a competitive environment), because collaboration and knowledge exchange can be beneficial to the population in an era that individual organizations are not always capable of solving big societal and organizational challenges. The ‘classic’ resource-based view is very much focussed on the sustained competitive advantage of an individual organization. Our alternative open resource-based view to SHRM is aimed at the sustained benefits for organizations, individuals (employees and citizens) and society. In addition, using an open resource based theoretical perspective can still contribute to organizational sustained competitive advantage because of uniqueness through strategic focus of the HR function on specific themes that matter for the organization including the relevance of organizational context.\n\nStrategic decision makers and HRM professionals can focus on HRM themes that matter and need special attention such as: building and changing organizational culture; creating a degree of psychological safety; contributing to the quality of collaboration both inside and outside with institutions, contractors, clients and suppliers; and positively affecting the degree of agility. Instead of the numerous day-to-day HRM activities (such as screening applicants and writing manuals) that are usually on the table, the application of ChatGPT on multiple HRM issues creates leeway for strategic focus on more complex and sophisticated organizational issues. Uniqueness lies in the fact that HRM professionals can focus on the things that really matter but are also difficult to dehumanize through ChatGPT. The very fact that HR professionals know both the internal and external context of their organization will enable\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
