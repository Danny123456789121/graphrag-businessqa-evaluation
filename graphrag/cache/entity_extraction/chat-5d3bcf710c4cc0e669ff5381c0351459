Using the Pearson Correlation method, Yu, Ting, and Wu (2009) examine 51 European companies from 14 industries across 15 countries to investigate the possible relationship, and find there is no correlation. Although it was not able to find a positive association between environmental performance and financial performance, Yu et al. (2009) state that being perceived as a green company may improve a company’s image and reputation, thus attracting more talented workers and green-conscious customers. Wagner (2005) finds a negative (for the emission-based index) and no (for the inputs-based index) relationship between environmental and economic performance.\n\nDue to the mixed results found in prior literature, the hypothesis was therefore developed as a null form.\n\n# Hypothesis:\n\nThere is no relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance.\n\n# III. DATASET DEVELOPMENT, CODING SCHEME, AND METHODOLOGY\n\n# Dataset Development\n\nWe identified extant empirical research studies focusing on the relationship between sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. In order to locate as many relevant articles as possible from the existing literature, we conducted keyword searches of appropriate electronic databases for both published and unpublished (working) papers. To identify published articles for the meta-analysis dataset, Business Source Complete was used. The Business Source Complete database provides easy access to over 4,000 academic peer-reviewed journals covering all fields of business, in which over 3,000 journals provide full-text articles, and the remaining 1,000 journals offer indexing or abstracts. Since this study focuses only on one relationship—corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance—we used the following words or terms to search published articles in the Business Source Complete database: “sustainability,” “corporate social responsibility,” “corporate responsibility,” “corporate social responsibility performance,” “CSR performance,” “environmental performance,” “social performance,” “environmental disclosure,” “CSR reporting,” “economic performance,” “financial performance,” and “firm value.”\n\nTo address the publication bias or the “file-drawer” problem, we also searched for relevant unpublished papers using keyword searches in the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) and Google Scholar. The keywords used in searching for unpublished articles were the same terms used for searching the Business Source Complete database.\n\nAfter identifying these studies, we evaluated the appropriateness of each one to our research focus to determine whether it was an eligible study to be included in the meta-analysis. To be eligible, a study had to meet three criteria: (1) the study must specifically examine the CSP-CFP relationship, since our paper focuses only on the CSP-CFP relationship; (2) the study must be available online in a full-text format; and (3) the study examining the CSP-CFP relationship must have a correlation (r) or equivalent statistics reported. These r equivalents can be a student t-value (t), p-value (p), beta coefficient (b), or Chi-squared (v2) since the correlation coefficient (r) value is needed when conducting meta-analytical procedures.\n\nFollowing the searching procedures and inclusion criteria listed above, a total of 36 primary articles were identified as eligible and their published journals included the following: Accounting, Organizations and Society; Academy of Management Review; Journal of Accounting and Economics; Journal of Economics and Business; Business Strategy and the Environment; Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal; The Journal of Finance; and etc. Although we would have liked to include published studies from leading accounting journals, our examination of these literature bases revealed theoretical, descriptive, or analytical work on sustainability performance that typically provides no equivalent correlation statistics to make their use possible in our meta-analysis. Additionally, the topics of some articles found in our searches did not address the CSP-CFP relationship, making their inclusion in our meta-analysis inappropriate.4 The identified 36 articles yielded 198 effect sizes and a total of 31,514 observations.\n\n4 For example, we excluded Moser and Martin (2012), O’Dwyer (2009), Evans (2012), Hart (1971) from The Accounting Review due to their being solely theoretical (or descriptive) in nature. Similarly, we had to delete Kim, Myung, and Wier (2012), Dhaliwal, Oliver, Tsang, and Yong (2011), Dhaliwal, Radhakrishnan, Tsang, and Yong (2012), and Chun, Wu, and Zhang (2013) from The Accounting Review due to their non CSP-CFP relationship research. We also removed Ingram (1978) and Ingram and Frazier (1980) from Journal of Accounting Research, and Murphy (1985) from Journal of Accounting and Economics. Another two articles by O’Dwyer (2011) and Dillard (2011) from Contemporary Accounting Research were also excluded from our meta-analysis.\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?\n\nThe effect size used in our meta-analysis is the point biserial correlation coefficient. It is an appropriate metric for our research because it is a commonly reported statistics metric in the existing studies. More importantly, it provides easy interpretation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
