If in these meta-analytic subgroups, a higher percentage of variance is accounted for by study artefacts relative to the entire meta-analytic set, moderators are said to exist.\n\n# Measurement Strategy as Moderator\n\nTo examine Hypotheses 4a and 4b, the entire data set of 388 correlations was broken down hierarchically to investigate the presence of moderator effects based on the operationalizations of CSP and CFP (see Table 4a). First, CFP and CSP operationalizations were disaggregated separately. Second, the four broad CSP operationalization subsets were broken down hierarchically into the two (or three, where available) CFP measurement categories. The lowest level in Table 4a is the only one that is not confounded by lack of standardized measurement and, thus, is the most informative.\n\nIn general, Table 4a indicates that the association between CSP and CFP depends on the firm’s or researcher’s operational definition of each construct, or both. Accounting measures were more highly correlated with CSP than.\n\n# Organization Studies 24(3)\n\n# File Drawer Analysis\n\nRefers to percentage of cross-study observed variance explained by three study artefacts: sampling error, measurement error in CSP, measurement error in CFP.\n\n75644175\nNA8\nNA777278353108118\nNA1332\n25\n6\n49\n\n# Variance of\n\nDown to .05.\n\nρ\n(2\n.1965\n.1525\n.1282\n.001\n.0000\n.2730\n.0000\n.0081\n.1875\n.1271\n.0844\n.1661\n.0000\n.0277\n.0567\n.0377\n.0109\n\n# True-\n\nFindings needed to bring\n\n‘ ρ ’\n\nMean\n24.2445\n5.6433\n98.47100\n.0089\n.7534\n.7739\n.6134\n00\n26.64100\n00\n22.58100\n.0061\n.7945\n44.9793\n90\n\n# Variance Explained\n\nVariance %\nTable 4a.
