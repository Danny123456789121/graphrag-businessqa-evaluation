Most previous studies have implicitly assumed that the impact of urbanization is homogenous for all countries. This assumption can be questionable as there are many characteristic differences among countries of different levels of affluence. This paper investigates empirically the effects of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of the different development stages. Using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005, the findings suggest that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the stages of development. Surprisingly, urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups. The impact of urbanization on emissions is positive for all the income groups, but it is more pronounced in the middle-income group than in the other income groups. These novel findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also can be of special interest to policy makers and urban planners.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nUrbanization is a phenomenon of economic and social modernization. It is not only the process of transferring rural labor from an agricultural-based economy to urban areas where industrial and service sectors predominate, but also the process of the structural transformation of rural areas into urban areas. Through these complex processes, the world has undergone rapid urbanization in recent decades, with the world urban population increasing from 1.52 billion in 1975 to 3.29 billion in 2007 (UN, 2008). Further, the urban population is projected to double to about 6.4 billion by 2050. To support such unprecedented growth, additional urban infrastructure will inevitably be called for. This possibly causes more resource consumption, exerting additional pressure on the already fragile ecosystem. In 2006, cities consumed about two-thirds of global energy and produced over 70% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, even though only around half the world's population lived there (IEA, 2008).\n\nThe relationship between urbanization and various environmental issues, including energy use and emissions, has been studied extensively in recent years. Some researchers show that urbanization increases energy demand, generating more emissions (Cole and Neumayer, 2004; Jones, 1991; Parikh and Shukla, 1995; York, 2007). However, it remains unclear whether the impact of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions varies across the different levels of development or income. Further study with careful consideration of the different development stages is imperative.\n\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Using a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005, the findings show that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the different levels of development. These novel empirical findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also deserve greater attention from policy makers.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background, literature review and hypotheses. Section 3 details the empirical model and methodology. Section 4 describes and discusses the results. Section 5 offers conclusions and policy implications.\n\n# 2. Theoretical Background, Literature Review and Hypotheses\n\n# 2.1. Theoretical Background\n\nAlthough urbanization is often discussed in the context of economic modernization, it is a demographic indicator that increases urban density and transforms the organization of human behavior, thereby influencing household energy use patterns (Barnes et al., 2005). However, the extent to which urbanization affects national energy use and CO2 emissions has not been fully and clearly explained in a single theory. Instead, some possible impacts of urbanization on the environment are partially and separately discussed in three relevant theories: ecological modernization, urban environmental transition and compact city theories. The first theory focuses on impacts at the national level, while the others discuss impacts at the city level.\n\nEcological modernization theory emphasizes not only economic modernization but also social and institutional transformations in explaining the effects of modernization on the environment. In this theory, urbanization is the process of social transformation regarded as one important indicator\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
