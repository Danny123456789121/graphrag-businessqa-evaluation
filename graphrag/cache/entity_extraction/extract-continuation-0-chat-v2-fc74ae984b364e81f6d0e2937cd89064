Includes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nLabor economists have often noted that the deployment of automation technologies tends to have the most impact on workers with the lowest skill levels, as measured by educational attainment, or what is called skill biased. We find that generative AI has the opposite pattern—it is likely to have the most incremental impact through automating some of the activities of more-educated workers (Exhibit 12).\n\n# Exhibit 12\n\nGenerative AI increases the potential for technical automation most in occupations requiring higher levels of educational attainment.\n\n# Impact of generative AI on technical automation potential in midpoint scenario, 2023\n\n|Education level|With generative AI|Without generative AI¹|Overall technical automation potential, comparison in midpoint scenarios, % in the United States in 2023|Share of US employment, %|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Master’s, PhD, or higher|57|28|13| |\n|Bachelor’s degree|60|36|22| |\n|Associate’s degree|62|45|9| |\n|Some college|64|48|22| |\n|High school diploma or equivalent|64|51|24| |\n|No high school degree|63|54|9| |\n\n¹Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nAnother way to interpret this result is that generative AI will challenge the attainment of multiyear degree credentials as an indicator of skills, and others have advocated for taking a more skills-based approach to workforce development in order to create more equitable, efficient workforce training and matching systems. Generative AI could still be described as skill-biased technological change, but with a different, perhaps more granular, description of skills that are more likely to be replaced than complemented by the activities that machines can do.\n\nPrevious generations of automation technology often had the most impact on occupations with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. For lower-wage occupations, making a case for work automation is more difficult because the potential benefits of automation compete against a lower cost of human labor. Additionally, some of the tasks performed in lower-wage occupations are technically difficult to automate—for example, manipulating fabric or picking delicate fruits. Some labor economists have observed a\n\n“hollowing out of the middle,” and our previous models have suggested that work automation would likely have the biggest midterm impact on lower-middle-income quintiles. However, generative AI’s impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation (Exhibit 13).\n\n# Exhibit 13\n\nGenerative AI could have the biggest impact on activities in high-wage jobs; previously, automation’s impact was highest in lower-middle-income quintiles.\n\n|Wage quintiles|Higher earners|81100|6180|4160|2140|020|Lower earners| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Without generative AI¹| |With generative AI|Largest increase in automation adoption from generative AI|Largest automation adoption without generative AI| | | | | | | | |\n|United States| |Japan|Germany|France|China|India|Mexico|South Africa| | | | |\n| | | |40|30|20|10|0|40|30|20|10|0|\n\n¹Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n43\n\n# Generative AI could propel higher productivity growth\n\nGlobal economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades.15 Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, long-term structural challenges—including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth.\n\nDeclining employment is among those obstacles. Compound annual growth in the total number of workers worldwide slowed from 2.5 percent in 1972–82 to just 0.8 percent in 2012–22, largely because of aging. In many large countries, the size of the workforce is already declining.16 Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 1992 to 2022 (Exhibit 14). However, since then, productivity growth has slowed in tandem with slowing employment growth, confounding economists and policy makers.17\n\n# Exhibit 14\n\nProductivity growth, the main engine of GDP growth over the past 30 years, slowed down in the past decade.\n\n|Real GDP growth contribution of employment and productivity growth, 1972–2022, global GDP growth, CAGR, %|Productivity growth bigger contributor to GDP growth|\n|---|---|\n|3.8| |\n|3.1\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that analyzes economic trends and labor markets, providing insights on the impact of technologies like generative AI on productivity and employment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that provides strategic advice to businesses and governments, including analysis on the economic potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where the impact of generative AI on employment and productivity is being analyzed, particularly in relation to educational attainment and wage quintiles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is one of the countries mentioned in the context of generative AI's impact on automation and productivity growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is referenced as a country experiencing the effects of generative AI on its labor market and productivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is included in the analysis of generative AI's impact on various countries' economies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is mentioned in the context of generative AI's influence on productivity and economic growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is referenced in the analysis of generative AI's impact on labor markets and productivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEXICO<|>GEO<|>Mexico is included in the discussion regarding the effects of generative AI on different economies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>GEO<|>South Africa is mentioned in the context of generative AI's impact on productivity and labor markets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant event that has affected global economic growth and labor markets, influencing the analysis of generative AI's potential.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>Both organizations are involved in analyzing the economic potential of generative AI and its impact on productivity and labor markets<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>The McKinsey Global Institute conducts research on the impact of generative AI in the United States, focusing on employment and productivity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>UNITED STATES<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the economy and labor market in the United States, influencing the analysis of generative AI<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPAN<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>Japan is one of the countries analyzed by the McKinsey Global Institute regarding the effects of generative AI on productivity<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMANY<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>Germany is included in the analysis of generative AI's impact on labor markets by the McKinsey Global Institute<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>France is part of the research conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute on generative AI's economic effects<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>China is analyzed by the McKinsey Global Institute for its labor market and productivity in relation to generative AI<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>India is included in the McKinsey Global Institute's research on the impact of generative AI<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEXICO<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>Mexico is part of the analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute regarding generative AI's effects on economies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>South Africa is mentioned in the context of the McKinsey Global Institute's research on generative AI<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
