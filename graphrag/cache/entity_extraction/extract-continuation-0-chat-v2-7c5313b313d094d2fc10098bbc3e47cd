Climate change presents major risks to the global financial system as well as new opportunities for investors. Is climate finance an important topic in finance research? We systematically analyse the content of 20,725 articles published in the leading 21 finance journals between January 1998 and June 2015. We find that only 12 articles (0.06%) are related in some way to climate finance. The three elite finance journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies) did not publish a single article related to climate finance over the 17.5-year period. We repeat our analysis across a sample of 29 elite business journals spanning accounting, economics, management, marketing and operations research, as well as finance. We find a similar dearth of published climate finance research. We consider four possible explanations for this failure of top finance and business journals to engage with climate finance as a research topic. These include methodological constraints and editorial policies. We conclude by arguing why it is critical for climate-related research to be given greater attention and prominence in finance journals.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nClimate change presents both major risks to the global financial system and an opportunity for investors. Climate finance has become a defining topic in policy and practice, with major current debates around stranded fossil fuel assets, divestment from carbon-intensive stocks, the direct (physical) impact of climate change on assets, carbon markets, green investing and development finance, risk management strategies including climate insurance and broader.\n\n* Ivan Diaz-Rainey\n\nivan.diaz-rainey@otago.ac.nz\n\n1 Department of Accountancy and Finance & the Otago Energy Research Centre (OERC), University of Otago, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand\n\n2 Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243â€“260\n\nfinancial stability risks (Dietz et al. 2016; Pauw et al. 2016; Batten et al. 2016; Griffin et al. 2015; Van Renssen 2014; Leaton 2011). There is no accepted taxonomy of climate finance, reflecting its emergent nature. However, common distinctions are made between mitigation or adaptation climate finance, and between public or private climate finance (Pauw et al. 2016).\n\nIn this paper, we explore whether climate finance is an important topic in finance research. Finance research is principally concerned with the functioning of private finance and so can help advance understanding of the interplay between financial markets and investors on the one hand and climate change on the otherâ€”be it related to mitigation or adaptation.\n\nAll the â€˜coreâ€™ areas of finance researchâ€”asset pricing, corporate finance and investmentsâ€”are relevant to climate change. As an illustrative example, the â€˜asset pricingâ€™ branch of finance research, which takes the perspective of traders, could help uncover to what degree investors are pricing carbon risk into asset values and is thus relevant to contemporary debates on stranded assets (Ansar et al. 2013; Carbon Tracker Initiative 2013, 2015; Dietz et al. 2016; Griffin et al. 2015; Leaton 2011). â€˜Corporate financeâ€™ researchers, who take the perspective of companies, could help establish whether energy majors have the balance sheets to support the financing of a capital-intensive low carbon transition (Tulloch et al. 2017). â€˜Investmentsâ€™ researchers can evaluate if climate-friendly investment funds or bonds outperform their alternatives on a risk-adjusted basis (MuÃ±oz et al. 2014). Finance research in non-core areas can also contribute to understanding the relationships between private finance and climate change. Finance researchers concerned with insurance, risk management and financial institutions can help answer questions such as the following: what impact will rising sea levels have on real estate assets in large cities? What financial instruments can be used hedge carbon risk in investment portfolios? How exposed are banks to carbon risk, and banking systems more generally? (see Alexander 2014; Andersson et al. 2016; Batten et al. 2016; Carney 2015; Carbon Tracker Initiative 2013; de Jong and Nguyen 2016).\n\nLeading climate change journals (including Nature Climate Change, Climatic Change and Global Environmental Change) have clearly engaged with climate finance topics (Dietz et al. 2016; Patenaude 2011; Pauw et al. 2016; Van Renssen 2014). One would similarly expect leading finance journals to have engaged with climate change.\n\nWe use systematic content analysis to identify climate change-related and climate finance-related articles in a sample of over 20,000 articles during a 17.5-year period since the Kyoto Protocol introduced global carbon markets. We repeat this analysis for a further sample of over 31,000 articles in elite business journals during the same time period to determine if our results are specific to finance journals, or are more broadly representative of accounting, economics, management and other business journals.
