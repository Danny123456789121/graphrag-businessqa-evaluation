Microsoft's announcement of a $10 billion investment in OpenAI has further amplified this trend, prompting other technology providers to enter the race. Google has recently launched an experimental service called “Bard”, and ‘Project Magi’ (to revolutionise web search experience) (Data Scientist, 2023), while Meta has released LLaMA, a language model with 65 billion parameters (Meta AI Research, 2023). Baidu has also entered with its ChatGPT-style service called “Wenxin Yiyan” in Chinese or “Ernie Bot” in English. In addition, Character.ai, an AI chatbot is capable of impersonating famous people or fictional characters. Naver, a South Korean search engine firm, has announced plans to launch “SearchGPT” in the first half of 2023. Meanwhile, Yandex, a Russian technology company, has revealed plans to release “YaLM 2.0” in Russian by the end of 2023. Therefore, we anticipate the technology may become more powerful and sophisticated as new players continue to enter the generative AI market, further extending its business applications and potential business risks. However, as any reader who has been unfortunate enough to have engaged with an automated web-based customer response chat system will be aware, such systems are also getting ever better at generating superficially credible waffle and flannel, and batting away unwanted queries, than genuinely working with people to solve problems.\n\nContrary to the hype build around generative AI systems like GPT-4, organisations have an enormous task to train and operationalise these systems within their existing business processes which will have several implications for HRM. The training process is labour intensive, to contextualise the outputs aligned to the needs of the firms. It also raises issues of the type of training; there is a difference between technical mastery of an AI system and functional knowledge of the area of management or operations it is meant to facilitate. Additionally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton (the so-called “Godfather of AI”) - who recently quit Google - has expressed his apprehensions about the potential risks associated with generative AI, including spreading misinformation, manipulating societal structures, disrupting the job markets, cyber security threats, and exploitation by malicious entities in unforeseen ways which could potentially lead to geo-political tensions, inflicting severe harm upon humanity (Guardian News, 2023). For instance, in the initial version launched in November 2022, which raise concerns about bias, real-world harm, how generative AI models are trained, and uncertainty surrounding the behaviour of ChatGPT (Bidle, 2022). Knowledge as to the emerging risks and threats posed by intelligent technologies, and indeed, regulation, has lagged far behind AI's advances. For instance, the US senate committee following the testimony of CEO of OpenAI has called for a new body to regulate the AI industry, however, considering the rapid pace of technological advancements, lawmakers also questioned whether such a regulatory body would be able to stay abreast of the developments (Clayton, 2023).\n\nAI itself may facilitate the research process but opens real risks given its predilection for concocting information when short of material or when prompted to do so. It also opens the opportunity for automated evaluation of research (Gendron et al., 2022). This automated evaluation can be beneficial in verifying the representation of multiple authentic voices in interview transcripts, ensuring the credibility of results presented in tables, and even confirming the authorship of a paper to prevent instances of outsourcing to AI. However, it also may curtail the chances for human judgement based on implicit and intangible knowledge, and, indeed, allowing machines to judge what research is appropriate opens new risks for both scholarship and practice. With such developments, if mentoring around a wide range of scholarly skills becomes redundant, traditions of scholarly knowledge sustenance may be lost (Gendron et al., 2022); the latter may be hard to rebuild if the impacts of a yet largely unproven technology prove counterproductive or even dangerous.\n\nThe ongoing advancements and discussions surrounding generative AI indicate its capacity to transform HRM processes, functions and activities. It is crucial to comprehend how organisations can harness its power to create value. We believe HRM research can offer important insights to critically examine and understand the implications of this new generation of ML models. By doing so, HRM can be driving force guiding responsible and purposeful adoption of generative AI which will lead to valuable HR outcomes. Considering the innovation\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\nand disruptive capabilities of generative AI, and its positive and negative consequences, we consolidate 11 perspectives to shed light on advancing HRM scholarship in this area. These perspectives aim to uncover unexplored research avenues that will guide HRM scholars to conduct future research, with the goal of understanding and guiding the responsible and ethical implementation of this technology in the society. The remainder of this perspectives editorial is organised as follows: Section 2 offers historical perspectives on the business implications of generative AI, including an open resource-based view on its integration in HRM and its impact on HRM-related outcomes. Section 3 focuses on employee relations, well-being, talent management, and performance management. In Section 4, a range of research opportunities is presented, covering International HRM, equity, diversity and inclusion, and sustainable HRM. Section 5 provides insights and recommendations for utilizing generative AI in academic research. Section 6 engages in a discussion of common themes emerging from the perspectives, analysing the implications of generative AI on the economy, society, and HRM. Lastly, Section 7 offers our concluding remarks.\n\nThe full list of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OPENAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization known for developing advanced AI models, including ChatGPT.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that has made a significant investment in OpenAI, amounting to $10 billion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a technology company that has launched an experimental AI service called Bard.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meta is a technology company that has released LLaMA, a language model with 65 billion parameters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAIDU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baidu is a Chinese technology company that has developed a ChatGPT-style service called Wenxin Yiyan or Ernie Bot.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Naver is a South Korean search engine firm planning to launch SearchGPT in the first half of 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Yandex<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yandex is a Russian technology company that plans to release YaLM 2.0 by the end of 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR GEOFFREY HINTON<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Geoffrey Hinton is a prominent figure in AI, known as the \"Godfather of AI,\" who has expressed concerns about the risks associated with generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>EVENT<|>ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI that has gained significant public attention and usage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HRM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HRM refers to Human Resource Management, which is impacted by advancements in generative AI technologies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>OPENAI<|>Microsoft has invested $10 billion in OpenAI, indicating a strong financial and strategic relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>OPENAI<|>Google's launch of Bard is a competitive response to OpenAI's ChatGPT, showing a direct relationship in the AI chatbot market<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META<|>OPENAI<|>Meta's release of LLaMA indicates competition with OpenAI's ChatGPT, highlighting their relationship in the AI development space<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAIDU<|>OPENAI<|>Baidu's development of a ChatGPT-style service shows its competitive stance against OpenAI's offerings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVER<|>OPENAI<|>Naver's plans to launch SearchGPT reflect its intention to compete with OpenAI's technologies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Yandex<|>OPENAI<|>Yandex's plans to release YaLM 2.0 indicate competition with OpenAI's generative AI models<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DR GEOFFREY HINTON<|>OPENAI<|>Dr. Geoffrey Hinton's concerns about generative AI relate to the implications of OpenAI's technologies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HRM<|>OPENAI<|>The advancements in generative AI, including those by OpenAI, have significant implications for HRM practices<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
