As highlighted by the Society for Human Resource Management, “if leaders don’t engage in an open dialogue with workers around GAI, then we’re just hoping they will understand, and a lot of them won’t, and those are the ones who will be left behind” (Folz, 2023). In addition, particularly for employees whose jobs will involve the use of GAI, they will need to be trained in the ethical implications of using GAI around the issues of bias, transparency, accuracy, accountability and data privacy, and security.\n\n# Technology Infrastructure Considerations\n\nA lack of technology infrastructure is one of the main barriers in adopting AI, including GAI, in organizations. Technology infrastructure refers not only to the hardware components associated with data storage, transfer, and processing/computing systems, but also to the softer infrastructure that includes the data itself (how it is generated and fed into the system), and the technical and business skills needed to effectively and efficiently implement and realize GAI algorithms (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). In this context, HT firms will have to ensure that it integrates with existing technology infrastructure, including operational platforms like property management systems for hotels, third-party systems like content management platforms for...\n\n# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research\n\n# Discussion and Conclusions\n\nThe introduction of GAI as a dynamic organizational capability for HT firms is predicted to have a dramatic impact on the industry. GAI has potential to create value for HT stakeholders in a transformative manner through the integration of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies (Dwivedi et al., 2023a; Sandstrom & Dunn, 2014). Rapid advancements in GAI will likely bring disruptive changes to the HT industry and transform how the HT industry approaches operations, marketing, destination management, human resources, revenue management, accounting and finance, design, and other operational strategies (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023a).\n\nAs such, GAI can be a technological tool that creates value for HT stakeholders by enhancing guest experience with human interaction when it is most needed while allowing GAI technology to address the repetitive and otherwise mundane tasks, and employees to engage in more creative tasks, leading to a better work-life balance for HT employees. It has the potential to generate a higher level of personalized products and services, elevate the guest experience, and build loyalty. GAI enriches guest experiences, maximizes revenues, reduces cost, and increases profitability. It also provides shareholders with more transparent and accurate insights regarding an organization’s financial health, and may help keep associates in the HT workforce longer and attract a new generation of HT leaders.\n\nWhile effective GAI implementation leads to value co-creation, ineffective management of the GAI applications could lead to value co-destruction by and for HT stakeholders. An over-reliance on GAI might create a perception that GAI-produced content and solutions are always more reliable, which may destroy collaborative organizational culture and lead to a climate of higher psychological competition, creating a toxic work environment, causing disunity, harming employees’ well-being, and leading to undesirable job-related outcomes, such as cynicism, depression, and burnout. For customers, the extensive integration of GAI may lead to a loss of autonomy in decision-making and overburden them and reduce or eliminate human interactions that are essential to HT experiences, which may result in value co-destruction (Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021). Sensitive customer information may be at risk of unauthorized access, manipulation, or misuse, leading to privacy violations and potential loss of trust in service providers.\n\nThe use of GAI-produced content raises further concerns about intellectual property and copyright infringement, as well as the authenticity and credibility of information provided to customers. The creation of false or misleading content by GAI could lead to disappointment or even danger for consumers, possibly resulting in customers being stranded or experiencing a significant inconvenience due to reliance on inaccurate information generated by GAI. Furthermore, GAI-driven recommendations might reinforce stereotypes or marginalize certain groups, leading to biased or discriminatory outcomes, where HT firms could face grave, service, reputational, and legal consequences. However, by embracing the potential of GAI, while considering its limitations and ethical issues, HT firms can embrace this disruptive technology and offer a more creative, effective, and inclusive experience for customers, employees, managers, and other HT stakeholders (Lee et al., 2023a, 2023b). Devised according to the tenets of stakeholder theory, the REFLECT model offers a comprehensive and clear understanding of the dynamics of value co-creation and co-destruction via GAI implementation by HT firms, and provides a theoretical and practical roadmap for this exciting technology.\n\n# Theoretical and Research Implications\n\nWhile limited, several studies have discussed the applications and potential implications of GAI in the context of the HT industry, research, and education. However, while discussing the use of this technology is important, conceptualizing and analyzing its potential impact on stakeholders from a value perspective is more important. Additionally, the applications for the HT industry have been discussed in an ad hoc and disorganized manner, and the primary focus of the implications has been limited to research and education. Moreover, extant studies mainly emphasize the legal and ethical issues that might arise from GAI applications. In the present study, we go beyond discussing GAI applications for research and education and the potential legal and ethical impacts resulting from the use of GAI in HT contexts. We present a wide range of GAI applications for the HT industry and propose a conceptual framework that provides a comprehensive account of the GAI impacts on HT stakeholders. This framework integrates the resource-based view of G\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that emphasizes the importance of engaging in open dialogue with workers regarding General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) to prevent misunderstandings and ensure proper training.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAI<|>EVENT<|>General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) refers to advanced AI systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, raising ethical implications and requiring employee training.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HT FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hospitality and Tourism (HT) firms that are integrating GAI into their operations to enhance guest experiences and improve efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKALEF & GUPTA<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who discuss the importance of technology infrastructure in adopting AI, including GAI, in organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DWIVEDI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who predict that GAI will have a dramatic impact on the hospitality and tourism industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDSTROM & DUNN<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who have explored the transformative potential of GAI in the hospitality and tourism sector.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARVALHO & IVANOV<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who analyze the operational strategies of HT firms in relation to GAI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFLECT MODEL<|>EVENT<|>A theoretical framework that provides insights into the dynamics of value co-creation and co-destruction through GAI implementation in HT firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRUNDNER & NEUHOFER<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who discuss the potential negative impacts of GAI on customer experiences and organizational culture.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<|>GAI<|>The Society for Human Resource Management emphasizes the need for dialogue about GAI to ensure understanding and proper training among employees.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HT FIRMS<|>GAI<|>HT firms are integrating GAI to enhance guest experiences and improve operational efficiency.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIKALEF & GUPTA<|>GAI<|>Mikalef & Gupta highlight the importance of technology infrastructure for the successful adoption of GAI in organizations.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DWIVEDI ET AL.<|>GAI<|>Dwivedi et al. predict that GAI will significantly impact the hospitality and tourism industry, transforming operations and strategies.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANDSTROM & DUNN<|>GAI<|>Sandstrom & Dunn explore how GAI can create value for stakeholders in the hospitality and tourism sector.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARVALHO & IVANOV<|>GAI<|>Carvalho & Ivanov analyze the operational strategies of HT firms in relation to GAI, discussing its transformative potential.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRUNDNER & NEUHOFER<|>GAI<|>Grundner & Neuhofer discuss the risks associated with GAI, including potential negative impacts on customer experiences and organizational culture.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HT FIRMS<|>REFLECT MODEL<|>HT firms can utilize the REFLECT model to understand the dynamics of value co-creation and co-destruction through GAI implementation.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
