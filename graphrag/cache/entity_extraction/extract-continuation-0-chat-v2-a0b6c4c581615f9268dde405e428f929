Note, however, that Flammer (2013) finds a significant effect, both for eco-friendly and eco-harmful corporate behaviors.\n\nSo, does it pay less to be good than it costs to be bad? As stated by Mattingly and Berman (2006), positive and negative social actions are both empirically and conceptually distinct (see also Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). In particular, ESG-positive events are more diverse in nature, while ESG-negative events are likely to be more compelling.\n\n# H2\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firmsâ€™ market value is larger for bad news, compared to good news.\n\nPublic relations and watchdog NGOs It is expected that shareholders pay more attention to what they see as the most neutral source of information. As such, we expect that the media would be more influential, both because of their objectivity and their wide readership, relative to less independent sources of ESG news. Accordingly, we hypothesize that news published by the companies themselves (firmsâ€™ press releases) or by NGOs have a lower impact on stock price, than news published by the media.\n\nIndeed, to cope with increasing ESG concerns, companies have adapted their communication strategy. In particular, they disclose more and more information concerning their social responsibility. Obviously, it raises the question of the relevance of such news disclosures in a context of informational asymmetries. On the one hand, companies have a clear informational advantage but, on the other hand, the credibility of firmsâ€™ announcements is low given that they have an interest to distort information to their own benefit.\n\nWhile there is a growing theoretical literature on greenwashing and ESG disclosures (Baron 2005; Lyon and Maxwell 2011), empirical evidence on the effectiveness and the impact of such strategies is missing. A similar issue arises with NGOs. NGOs engage in private politics (Baron 2001), trying to influence firmsâ€™ ESG practices. They have two main choices. They can either work directly with firms and highlight ESG improvements or report bad ESG practices (Lyon 2010), to influence medias and consumers. With the recent rise of public awareness on ESG issues, several NGOs choose to focus on public information campaigns rather than lobby the government (Yu 2005).\n\nAre advocacy NGOs able to impact stock prices? Is collaboration (by disclosing positive ESG news) more efficient than denunciation (bad news)? Several papers have cast doubt on NGOs influence, and there are growing debates on collaboration between.\n\nInterestingly, Zyglidopoulos et al. (2012) find that more media attention leads to an increase in CSR strengths, but does not drive any significant change in CSR weaknesses. Yet, this is still consistent with our hypothesis suggesting that it is more expensive for firms to improve their weaknesses, than to enhance their strengths.\n\nG. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit\n\nNGOs and corporations (Yaziji and Doh 2009), which could lower NGOs credibility (Gibelman and Gelman 2004). To our knowledge, there is no impact assessments other than case studies (Spar and Mure 2003; Doh and Guay 2006). We attempt to provide insights on these issues by testing whether the impact of ESG news varies according to the source.\n\n# H 3\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firmsâ€™ market value is larger for bad news, compared to good news.\n\n# H 3\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firmsâ€™ market value is larger when it comes from the media, compared to the firms themselves or NGOs.\n\n# Media visibility and specialization\n\nIn practice, shareholders do not give equal importance to all sources. In particular, it is expected that disclosures of the leading financial newspapers have a larger impact. For instance, Huberman and Regev (2001) have shown that the market might react sharply to a news published in The New York Times, even if the information has been already reported in various popular journals or newspapers (Nature, Times, etc.). Conversely, it is likely that shareholders who value ESG issues scrutinize specialized media dedicated to CSR. All together, this leads to two non-exclusive hypotheses.\n\n# H 4a\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firmsâ€™ market value is larger when it comes from leading financial newspapers.\n\n# H 4b\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firmsâ€™ market value is larger when it comes from media dedicated to CSR.\n\n# Main Environmental, Social or Governance issues\n\nIt seems, a priori, quite natural to separate environmental, social and corporate governance issues when testing whether one particular dimension of CSR has more importance for shareholders. However, there is no theoretical underpinnings and it appears to be mostly an empirical issue. In this respect, the literature on Socially Responsible Investing might provide some information: there is preliminary evidence of superior returns for portfolios based on employee relations (Edmans 2012) and corporate governance (Barnett and Salomon 2006; Renneboog et al. 2011), but we should be cautious in generalizing these findings. It seems more appropriate to consider the effect at a sectoral level. The impact of ESG news might be larger when the event is associated with a main concern for the firm.\n\nAs stated by Caroll (1979), the issues that business must address largely differ depending on the industry. Different industries face different problems and external pressure might vary accordingly (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). For instance, environmental issues are undoubtedly more important for the Oil and gas sector than for the banking sector.\n\n# H 7\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firmsâ€™ market value is lower in times of economic crisis.\n\nReputation The theoretical literature on the effect of reputation on financial performance is somewhat inconclusive.
