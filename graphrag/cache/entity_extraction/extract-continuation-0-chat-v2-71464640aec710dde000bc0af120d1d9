Corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) is considered a useful tool to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of stakeholders in the quest for sustainability. However, the degree of cultural and political influences for being sustainably orientated can be significantly different between countries. This study aims to examine the perception of financial analysts, as CSD report users, in China about the level of importance of various indicators of corporate sustainability described in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – A set of questionnaires was developed based on GRI G4 guidelines to measure the perception of financial analysts in China on the level of importance of each sustainability indicator described in the GRI G4. A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the report users’ perceptions of each of the indicators.\n\nFindings – The findings of this study increase our understanding of how Chinese CSD report users perceive corporate sustainability differently from the GRI guidelines. The main results show that the environmental aspect of sustainability was seen to be important in China, followed by the social and economic aspects. Indicator-wise, “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” were perceived as vital in the environmental category, while “customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” were considered significant in the social category.\n\nOriginality/value – This study addresses the need for differing corporate sustainability guidelines for different nations and cultures, specifically within the Chinese context. It also contributes to the corporate sustainability literature by adding to our understanding of how financial analysts in China, as CSD report users, perceive aspects of sustainability.\n\nKeywords China, Financial analysts, Sustainability, GRI, Corporate sustainability disclosure, Users’ perception\n\nPaper type Research paper\n\n# Jhunru Zhang and Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta\n\nare both based at the School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia.\n\n# Terri Trireksani\n\nis based at the School of Business, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nWhile the economic development of China over the preceding decades has led to significant improvement in its national prosperity, it has also generated a considerable degree of concern about corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability disclosures (CSD) are generally considered to be the most effective and efficient way for companies to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of company stakeholders’ quest for sustainability and to inform the society about their sustainability performance (Qian et al., 2015). Because of the lack of comprehensive and effectively enforced CSD regulations, the growth of corporate sustainability practices in China extensively depends on voluntary disclosure practice (Zhang et al., 2015). However, as\n\nReceived 21 October 2018\n\nRevised 8 July 2019\n\nAccepted 14 July 2019\n\nDOI 10.1108/SRJ-10-2018-0272\n\n© Emerald Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j\n\nRecognised the importance of issuing corporate sustainability reports because of the severe environmental deterioration and significant social issues raised in tandem with the boost of the Chinese economy.\n\nFor example, the serious milk powder corporate scandals in mainland China have raised extreme concern regarding companies’ social responsibility: in 2008, Sanlu Group added melamine into the formula of milk powder to boost the protein content. Infants who consumed this product were highly likely to develop kidney stones or even an illness that was fatal if seriously affected. Sanlu Group was one of the largest milk powder manufacturers and sellers in China for over 15 continuous years, and it was once the biggest taxpayer. The revelation of the scandal caused the failure and bankruptcy of Sanlu, and, more importantly, it destroyed people’s confidence in the Chinese milk powder supply industry. The 300,000 victims triggered considerable social pressure, which consequently affected thousands of workers, causing them to lose their jobs (Nornha et al., 2013). Society, as a result, had to bear this significant social cost.\n\nAs such, the unique context in China provides a significant setting to examine CSD perception from its users’ end. The local Chinese community, in general, has relatively high societal acceptance towards CSD information. Under the Confucius perspective, maximising shareholders’ value and financial profit should not be the only goal of making corporations sustainable (Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009). Xia et al. (2009) emphasised the idea of righteousness before profits and stated that the fundamental value of ethics should reflect the business values. Hence, concerns and actions should always be closely related to all of the customers’, employees’ and shareholders’ values, and sustainability information is in favour for the general community as Confucian culture has been embedded in the basis of modern corporate sustainability in Chinese companies (Zhu and Yao, 2008).\n\nIn addition, Chinese enterprises are increasingly pressured by numerous stakeholders and by the general public to engage in social and environmental sustainability. In particular, in China, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) have made a great effort to promote corporate governance initiatives in past years. Ho (2013) indicates that the rapid growth of these markets is significantly influenced by two essential pieces of legislation: the Company Law and the Securities Law, enacted in 1993 and 1998, respectively. The Company Law provides the legal requirement for the transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private or listed enterprises. To conform to the two legislations, the stock exchanges in China have implemented guidelines for their listed corporations to take responsibility for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JHUNRU ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Jhunru Zhang is a researcher based at the School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia, focusing on corporate sustainability in China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HADRIAN GERI DJAJADIKERTA<|>PERSON<|>Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta is a researcher based at the School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia, focusing on corporate sustainability in China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERRI TRIREKSANI<|>PERSON<|>Terri Trireksani is a researcher based at the School of Business, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia, focusing on corporate sustainability in China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDITH COWAN UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Edith Cowan University is an educational institution located in Joondalup, Australia, where Jhunru Zhang and Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta are based.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURDOCH UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Murdoch University is an educational institution located in Perth, Australia, where Terri Trireksani is based.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country in East Asia that has become a subject of increasing international concern regarding corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides sustainability reporting guidelines that are used to measure corporate sustainability disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHENZHEN STOCK EXCHANGE (SZSE)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) is a stock exchange in China that promotes corporate governance initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI STOCK EXCHANGE (SSE)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is a stock exchange in China that promotes corporate governance initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANLU GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sanlu Group was one of the largest milk powder manufacturers in China, involved in a scandal that raised concerns about corporate social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE (CSD)<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Sustainability Disclosure (CSD) refers to the practice of companies reporting their sustainability performance to stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHUNRU ZHANG<|>EDITH COWAN UNIVERSITY<|>Jhunru Zhang is a researcher at Edith Cowan University, contributing to studies on corporate sustainability in China<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HADRIAN GERI DJAJADIKERTA<|>EDITH COWAN UNIVERSITY<|>Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta is a researcher at Edith Cowan University, contributing to studies on corporate sustainability in China<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERRI TRIREKSANI<|>MURDOCH UNIVERSITY<|>Terri Trireksani is a researcher at Murdoch University, contributing to studies on corporate sustainability in China<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHUNRU ZHANG<|>GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI)<|>Jhunru Zhang's research examines the perception of financial analysts in China regarding GRI sustainability reporting guidelines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HADRIAN GERI DJAJADIKERTA<|>GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI)<|>Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta's research examines the perception of financial analysts in China regarding GRI sustainability reporting guidelines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERRI TRIREKSANI<|>GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI)<|>Terri Trireksani's research examines the perception of financial analysts in China regarding GRI sustainability reporting guidelines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE (CSD)<|>Corporate sustainability disclosure is a significant issue in China, reflecting the country's growing concern for sustainability practices<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANLU GROUP<|>CHINA<|>The Sanlu Group scandal raised significant concerns about corporate social responsibility in China, impacting public trust<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHENZHEN STOCK EXCHANGE (SZSE)<|>CHINA<|>The SZSE promotes corporate governance initiatives in China, influencing corporate sustainability practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHANGHAI STOCK EXCHANGE (SSE)<|>CHINA<|>The SSE promotes corporate governance initiatives in China, influencing corporate sustainability practices<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
