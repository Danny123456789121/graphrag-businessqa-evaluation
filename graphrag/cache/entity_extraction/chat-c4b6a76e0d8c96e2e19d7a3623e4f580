Robustness checks with the tracking portfolio\n\nWe run a number of tracking portfolio regressions, in which we use the contemporaneous temperature, one-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+3), two-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+6), three-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+9), and four-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+12) as the dependent variable. To remove the seasonality in monthly temperatures, we follow Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and use temperature anomalies, defined relative to the 1951-1980 average. The basis assets are six size-value portfolios in Panel A, and 10 industry-size and BM portfolios in Panel B. T-statistics use Newey-West standard errors with lag (bandwidth) determined as max[3, 2*horizon] following Bekaert and Hoerova (2014), where the horizon equals the number of months in the forecast interval.\n\n# Panel A: Tracking portfolio regressions with alternative forecast horizons based on six size-value portfolios\n\n| |Contemporaneous|1-quarter ahead|2-quarter ahead|3-quarter ahead|4-quarter ahead| | | | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Coeff|t-ratio|Coeff|t-ratio|Coeff|t-ratio|Coeff|t-ratio|Coeff|t-ratio| | | |\n|SLt|0.016|0.35| |0.051|1.71| |0.041|1.90| |0.039|2.51|0.023|1.91|\n|SMt|-0.098|-1.05| |-0.078|-1.37| |-0.012|-0.29| |-0.019|-0.56|0.001|0.04|\n|SHt|0.093|1.35| |0.019|0.40| |-0.051|-1.48| |-0.039|-1.41|-0.046|-2.09|\n|BLt|0.080|1.86| |0.053|1.83| |0.011|0.51| |0.003|0.22|0.005|0.32|\n|BMt|-0.115|-2.15| |-0.042|-1.08| |-0.007|-0.23| |0.005|0.26|0.017|0.91|\n|BHt|0.033|0.72| |-0.001|-0.02| |0.013|0.61| |0.002|0.14|0.001|0.07|\n|Constant|-0.644|-2.24| |-0.727|-2.39| |-0.739|-2.18| |-0.716|-2.19|-0.757|-2.43|\n|RFt-1|-1.060|-2.20| |-1.233|-2.47| |-0.883|-1.71| |-0.640|-1.27|-0.629|-1.30|\n|DEFt-1|0.220|1.00| |0.199|0.78| |0.007|0.03| |-0.073|-0.31|-0.088|-0.39|\n|TERMt-1|-0.230|-1.83| |-0.254|-2.31| |-0.170|-1.56| |-0.122|-1.14|-0.120|-1.12|\n|t|0.002|3.72| |0.003|5.24|0.003| |4.36|0.002| |3.95|0.002|4.28|\n|Tt-h|0.250|2.13|0.053|1.07|0.041|0.56|0.115|1.23|0.111|1.12| | | |\n|Adj-R2|0.08| | |0.17| | |0.23| | |0.31| |0.38| |\n|2 p-value|0.20| | |0.10| | |0.28| | |0.13| |0.05| |\n|Mean|0.01|1.53| |-0.02|-2.43| |-0.03|-4.57|-0.03| |-5.11|-0.02|-4.26|\n\n# Panel B: Tracking portfolio regressions with alternative forecast horizons based on 10 industry portfolios\n\n| |Contemporaneous|1-quarter ahead|2-quarter ahead\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
