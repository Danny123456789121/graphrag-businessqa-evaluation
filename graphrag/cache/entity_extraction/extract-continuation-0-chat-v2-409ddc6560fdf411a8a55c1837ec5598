Most striking, albeit consistent with some concerns about their lack of credibility, the financial impact of ESG news published by NGOs are not significant. Confronted to a profusion of competing daily news, investors may react strongly to a disclosure that is not genuinely new (Huberman and Regev 2001). NGOs’ disclosures may influence media information (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017), while only media information directly influence investors. Considering this, the indirect impact of NGOs on stock markets remains a potential field of research.\n\n# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\nSubsequently, given the previous findings, we only consider negative events published by the media and the event windows that catch the best the impact on the stock markets ([-1;?1] and [-5;?5]).\n\n# Regression Analysis of CAR\n\nTable 3 shows the results of several models regressing changes in firm’s market value related to negative ESG news published by the media, on a set of independent variables capturing certain characteristics of the news or the targeted firm. Changes in firm’s market value are expressed as a percentage variation from expected returns over a 3-day period (CAR½ 1;þ1) and a 10-day period (CAR½ 5;þ5). Columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 include company fixed effects to capture idiosyncrasies. We measure the impact of sectors’ and companies’ reputation and greenwashing with the past disclosures on their ESG activities. As we are mostly interested in analyzing the effect of reputation and greenwashing between firms and sectors, we do not include these variables in specifications including company fixed effects. Therefore, columns 3, 4, 7 and 8 only include HQs’ country fixed effects. All regressions include White-corrected robust standard errors.\n\n# Source\n\nThe nature of the media has very little influence on the magnitude of the shareholders’ reaction to negative ESG news, which is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis (hypothesis #4a for leading financial newspapers and #4b for CSR specialized media). Nevertheless, this question should be further investigated, with more specific data on sources, to study the dynamics of information reports by different sources.\n\n# E, S, G?\n\nThe literature did not provide clear ideas on what dimension of CSR should be, a priori, the most important for shareholders. Our results suggest that the average impact of negative ESG news is similar whether it concerns environmental issues, social issues or corporate governance issues. We hypothesized also that the impact of ESG news might be larger when the event is associated with a main concern for the firm (hypothesis #5). The effect is not significant, and it appears that shareholders attach as much.\n\nTable 10 in ‘‘Appendix’’ section only considers cumulative abnormal returns significant at the 1% level. Table 11 uses a larger estimation window ½ 130; 11 which is ‘‘decontaminated’’ (the days when a firm experiments ESG events were removed from the estimation windows).\n\nWe do not find that the coefficient on the time trend is significantly negative (i.e., the loss gets stronger over time). While the number of ESG news covered by the media has increased (see Fig. 5), the perception of ESG events has not really changed during the last decade. External pressure to become socially responsible is similar, and firms have not been increasingly penalized by shareholders when they experienced negative ESG news (hypothesis #6). This result might appear inconsistent with Flammer (2013), but remember that we consider only 8 years (2002–2010), while Flammer (2013) considers three decades (1980–2009).\n\nWe also posited that shareholders’ attitude toward ESG news might be impacted by the crisis (hypothesis #7). We do not find any significant impact, either positive or negative.\n\n# Past Disclosures: Reputation and Greenwashing\n\nOur results suggest that a sector’s ESG reputation could act as a shield against potential shareholders’ losses (hypothesis #8a). Indeed, the more positive the past media coverage on a sector’s ESG issues, the lower the loss due to a negative ESG news. This confirms the ‘‘reservoir of goodwill’’ hypothesis, at a sectoral level at least. The result is barely significant when considering firm’s reputation compared to its peers (hypothesis #8b), which is in line with most of the previous literature.\n\nAre firms able to mediate the impact of adverse ESG events by disclosing their own positive ESG news (hypothesis #9)? The answer seems to be yes: the more ESG communications firms issued in the preceding year, the lower the impact of negative news on stock market performance. Public relations, which could include greenwashing, are useful to reduce the direct financial penalties in times of trouble. However, the long-run dynamics of the strategic interactions between companies, NGOs and the media are ambiguous and should be the subject of further investigations. Public relations influence shareholders, but.\n\nSimilarly, we also tested whether upcoming weekend (the so-called Friday effect) or holidays distract shareholders from ESG issues (DellaVigna and Pollet 2009), but we did not find any impact as well. We have also controlled for the total amount of news reported in the Dow Jones Factiva database (therefore, including non-ESG news), which can be considered as a proxy of limited attention of shareholders (Hirshleifer et al. 2009); the results were not significant.\n\n# Table 3 Determinants of the market reaction following negative ESG events disclosed by the media\n\n|Event window|CAAR½ 1;þ1|CAAR½ 5;�\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ESG NEWS<|>EVENT<|>ESG news refers to environmental, social, and governance disclosures that can impact investor sentiment and market performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGOs<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are entities that publish ESG news, which may influence media information and investor reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Media outlets report on ESG news and have a direct influence on investors' reactions to such news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #4A<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #4A refers to the efficient market hypothesis regarding the influence of leading financial newspapers on shareholder reactions to negative ESG news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #4B<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #4B refers to the efficient market hypothesis regarding the influence of CSR specialized media on shareholder reactions to negative ESG news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #5<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #5 posits that the impact of ESG news might be larger when associated with a main concern for the firm.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #6<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #6 suggests that firms have not been increasingly penalized by shareholders for negative ESG news over time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #7<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #7 investigates whether shareholders' attitudes toward ESG news are impacted by crises.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #8A<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #8A posits that a sector's ESG reputation could shield against potential shareholder losses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #8B<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #8B suggests that a firm's reputation compared to its peers may influence shareholder reactions to ESG news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #9<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis #9 tests whether firms can mitigate the impact of adverse ESG events by disclosing positive ESG news.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGOs<|>MEDIA<|>NGOs publish ESG news that is reported by the media, influencing investor reactions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #4A<|>HYPOTHESIS #4B<|>Both hypotheses relate to the influence of different types of media on shareholder reactions to negative ESG news<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #5<|>HYPOTHESIS #6<|>These hypotheses explore the relationship between firm concerns and shareholder penalties regarding ESG news<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #8A<|>HYPOTHESIS #8B<|>Both hypotheses examine the impact of sector and firm reputation on shareholder reactions to ESG news<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOTHESIS #9<|>HYPOTHESIS #6<|>These hypotheses investigate the potential for firms to mitigate negative impacts from ESG news through positive disclosures<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
