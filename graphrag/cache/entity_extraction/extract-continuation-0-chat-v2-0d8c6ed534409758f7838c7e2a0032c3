The non-significant result confirms that in Asia the industry setting is not a significant contingent factor for the linkage between CSR and business performance. Therefore, we could not conclude that CSR has a larger effect for manufacturing firms than for service firms in East Asia. Hypothesis 5 is not supported.\n\nFirm-specific characteristics are additional potential moderating factors affecting the CSRâbusiness performance relationship. We explored the linkage by examining the difference between subgroups of SMEs versus non-SMEs and private versus public firms. Supporting Hypothesis 6, we found that firm size moderates the CSRâbusiness performance relationship (Î² = â.184, p = .000). Meta-regression results show that CSR has a stronger impact on business performance for SMEs than for non-SMEs. The result supports Hypothesis 6, in opposition to Allouche and Laroche (2005) who found that firm size does not influence the impact of CSR. Future studies can explore this issue further.\n\nTesting Hypothesis 7, we found that organizational form has a significant moderating effect (Î² = .149, p = .003) and that CSR has a stronger impact on business performance for private firms than for public firms. This result supports Hypothesis 7.\n\nAs discussed previously, CSRâbusiness performance studies have used a variety of CSR measures. Concerning the exploratory methodological moderators, Table 3 presents the relationships between the two most commonly used CSR measures and business performance, indicating that they were different in empirical studies (Î² =\n\n|Independent variables|Dependant variable: Correlation between overall CSR and business performance| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Moderators| | | | | | |\n|Economic development|Developed vs. developing|â.120*|.028|.055|.042|â.227/â.013|\n|Industry setting|Manufacturing vs. service|.034|.707|.091|.071|â.144/.212|\n|Firm size|Non-SMEs vs. SMEs|â.184***|.000|.048|.006|â.278/â.090|\n|Organizational form|Private vs. public|.149**|.003|.050|.014|.051/.246|\n|Measurement|Archival vs. self-report|â.327***|.000|.035|.020|â.396/â.257|\n| |Overall CSR evolution|â.002|.861|.010|.040|â.021/.017|\n\n* p &lt; .05 ** p &lt; .01 *** p &lt; .001\n\nThe above moderators were treated as independent variables (economic development: developed = 1; developing = 0, industry setting: manufacturing = 1; service = 0, firm size: Non-SMEs = 1; SMEs = 0, organizational form: private = 1; public = 0, measurement: archival = 1; self-report = 0)\n\nM. Hou et al.\n\nâ.327, p = .000). Direct CSR (self-report) measure has a larger effect than indirect CSR (archival) measure on business performance.\n\nWe are also interested in the evolution of CSRâs influence on business performance in the past decade. In our meta-analytic regression model, we treated publication time as independent variables (from 2001 to 2015). Table 3 reports the results of meta-regression exploring the evolution of CSR over time. However, the regression coefficient is non-significant (Î² = â.002, n.s.). Therefore, we found no significant evolutionary tendency of CSR in East Asia.\n\n# Discussion\n\nOrlitzky et al. (2003) conducted the first meta-analysis on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, but they focused mainly on Western studies. Twelve years ago in East Asia, the idea of CSR was less popular than it is today, so empirical research for East Asian CSR practice is rare. Today, however, research on CSRâbusiness performance relationships in East Asian contexts is accelerating, although studies have been inconclusive so far (Barnett & Salomon, 2012). The time is now appropriate for a meta-analysis focused on CSR in East Asia.\n\nIn studying whether CSR is profitable in East Asia, our quantitative review suggests that CSR has an overall significant, positive relationship with business performance, both financial and operational, consistent with most prior studies (Cheung et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2006; Oh et al., 2011) but different from Li and Zhang (2010) and Cao (2011). In addition, we find CSR exerts a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance.\n\nInterestingly, our meta-analysis demonstrates several unique findings on East Asian CSR practices which are different from Western countries. For instance, based on 52 Western background studies and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Social CSR refers to organizations that engage in corporate social responsibility practices aimed at benefiting society and the environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Environmental CSR involves organizations that focus on environmental sustainability and responsible ecological practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>GEO<|>East Asia is a region in Asia that includes countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and others, where CSR practices are being studied.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>M.
