Although results have been mixed, the majority of the research, including meta-analytic results (Orlitzky et al. 2003), suggest that indeed a positive relationship does exist between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).\n\nWhile establishing a link between CEP and CFP provides an important contribution, the specific boundary...\n\n# Corporate Environmental and Financial Performance\n\nConditions surrounding the relationship remain unclear. As a result, interest is growing in identifying relevant variables that may moderate the CEP–CFP relationship (Russo and Fouts 1997). A poll of scholars in the Organizations and the Natural Environmental division of the Academy of Management stressed the need for, “increasingly sophisticated research to examine the link between environmental strategy and competitive advantage” (Sharma and Starik 2002, p. 11). Moreover, a number of scholars have emphasized the need for adopting a contingency perspective in the treatment of CEP–CFP research (e.g., Sharma and Starik 2002; Wagner 2007; Christmann 2000). In response, a few studies have found promise in attempting to address these issues (e.g., Christmann 2000; Klassen and Whybark 1999). The results of these studies highlight the need to better understand competitive advantage resulting from CEP. Thus, we must move beyond simply asking “Does it pay to be green?” to “When does it pay to be green?” (Sharma and Starik 2002).\n\nUnfortunately, answering these questions has presented a challenge for a number of reasons. First, the research examining the CEP–CFP link spans academic disciplines (i.e., management, finance, economics, accounting, marketing) and theoretical lenses making synthesis and interpretation difficult (Klassen and Whybark 1999). Second, there has been a lack of consensus and norms in empirical studies regarding the selection of the appropriate environmental performance, financial performance, and control variables necessary to examine these relationships (Wagner 2007). These differences in methodologies have often been blamed for the inconsistencies in findings in the CEP–CFP literature (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Russo and Fouts 1997; Ullman 1985). As a result of these issues, the practical implications of this research stream remain limited (Klassen and Whybark 1999) leaving managers with limited guidance in their efforts to improve CEP.\n\nAlthough research on organizations and the natural environment, including the CEP–CFP link, has been the subject of narrative and meta-analytic reviews in the management literature (Ambec and Lanoie 2008; Etzion 2007; Orlitzky et al. 2003, Sharma and Starik 2002), to date, there has not been a meta-analytical empirical synthesis which goes beyond the basic question “Does it pay to be green?” In an effort to advance CEP–CFP research, we focus on systematically answering the question, “When does it pay to be green?” to provide important and necessary clarifications for both research and practice. To do so, we provide a meta-analytic review of CEP–CFP literature in which we identify potential moderators to the CEP–CFP link including environmental performance type (reactive vs. proactive), firm characteristics (e.g., large vs. small firm, public vs. private firm, US-based firms vs. international firms, and worst offenders vs. a broader representation of firms), and methodological issues (financial performance measures, emissions measures, self-report measures). By analyzing these contingencies, this study attempts to provide a basis on which to draw conclusions regarding some inconsistencies and debates in the CEP–CFP research.\n\nWe begin by discussing the background of the general CEF–CFP relationship. Next, we examine the arguments for the contingencies we identify including types of environmental performance, firm-level characteristics, and methodological inconsistencies. We then describe our meta-analytic procedures and outcomes. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results, implications, and possible directions for future research.\n\nThe research on the relationship between corporate environmental and financial performance has been the focus of several literature reviews (see Ambec and Lanoie 2008; Etzion 2007; Sharma and Starik 2002, for examples). The majority of the existing studies support a generally positive relationship between CEP and CFP (e.g., Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Nehrt 1996; Russo and Fouts 1997; Spicer 1978). The primary arguments in this line of research are that positive environmental performance represents a focus on innovation and operational efficiency (e.g., Porter and van der Linde 1995), reflects strong organizational and management capabilities (e.g., Aragon-Correa 1998), enhances firm legitimacy (e.g., Hart 1995), and allows a firm to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders (e.g., Freeman and Evan 1990).\n\nFirst, environmental performance is viewed as a proxy for operational efficiency (e.g., Porter and van der Linde 1995; Starik and Marcus 2000). The eco-efficiency argument is based on the notion that pollution is a waste of resources and represents unnecessary costs for the firm (Porter and van der Linde 1995). Improved efficiency via environmental performance lowers costs and increases innovation leading to competitive advantage (Aragon-Correa 1998; Christmann 2000; Judge and Douglas 1998; Klassen and Whybark 1999; Russo and Fouts 1997; Shrivastava 1995). Second, strong environmental performance might be viewed as a measure of organizational and managerial capabilities including a long-term versus short-term perspective, a focus on continuous innovation and reduced organizational risk (A\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
