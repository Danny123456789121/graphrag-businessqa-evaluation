Further, we test whether investors accept lower (higher) compensation for holding environmentally friendly stocks by searching for a negative (positive) risk premium, i.e. a Greenium. The excess return Ri,t follows the model in Equations (2)-(3). In particular, we consider the same linear factor models used in the previous section, adding the greenness and transparency factor fg among the observable factors as follows:\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n|Model|Factors|K|\n|---|---|---|\n|CAR + G|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fmom,t, fg,t|5|\n|3FF + G|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fg,t|4|\n|CAPM + G|fm,t, fg,t|2|\n\nThe risk premium associated with the greenness and transparency factor is defined as follows:\n\nλg = E[fg,t] + νg . (8)\n\nIn order to estimate the risk premia for the observable factors using individual stocks, we follow the estimation procedure proposed in Gagliardini et al. (2016). This procedure allows to deal with unbalanced panels, hence allowing to estimate the model on individual stocks rather than portfolios, and involves the following steps. First, we estimate the linear factor model by using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator. Second, we use the fitted residuals to test whether the model is correctly specified. In particular, we compute the diagnostic criterion proposed in Gagliardini et al. (2019), which checks whether the error terms share at least one unobserved common factor. Based on our sample, the criterion does not detect any common factor for the residuals, suggesting the validity of the factor structure.16 Third, we compute the cross-sectional estimator νk from (3) by Weighted Least Squares (WLS). Finally, the estimate of the risk premium ˆk for each factor is given by the sum of the expected λ return on the factor E[fk,t] and the estimate of ˆk.ν\n\nTable 4 shows the estimated risk premia attached to the factors, including the Greenium, as well as the estimates for νk. Looking at the first two columns of the table, almost all risk premia are significant across the board, and have the expected signs. In particular, the estimated risk premia for the market, size, value and momentum factors are comparable with the results in Gagliardini et al. (2016) and Chaieb et al. (2018). The estimated Greenium is negative and significant at the 1% level in all cases. A negative Greenium indicates that investors accept lower compensation, ceteris paribus, to hold assets that correlate positively with the greenness and transparency factor, i.e. greener and more environmentally transparent assets. The mainstream interpretation of this result is based on the assumption that investors only care about their portfolios’ future payoffs. Hence, if they accept a lower remuneration to hold a certain type of assets, this must be because by doing so they are hedging some risks. In this specific case, holding greener and more transparent stocks constitutes a hedging strategy against climate risk. In the case of more environmentally friendly and transparent stocks, however, other considerations may also play a role. In particular, as suggested by Fama and French (2007), investors decisions may also be driven by some ‘taste for assets’, unrelated to expected returns. In this light, an emerging ‘taste for green’ in the market could also explain our result.\n\n16For example, for the Carhart model plus the greenness and transparency factor, the difference between the largest eigenvalue of the empirical cross-sectional covariance matrix of the residuals ˆi,t and the penalization term is negative, pointing to the absence of ε omitted factors.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nThe last two columns of Table 4 refer to ˆk. Focussing on the greenness and transparency factor, ˆg is always ν negative and significant at the 1% level for the CAR+G, and at the 5% for the 3FF+G and CAPM+G models. For this component of the risk premium, the literature has proposed an interpretation linked to market imperfections (see, e.g. Daniel and Titman, 1997; Haugen and Baker, 1996). With reference to the Greenium, our hypothesis is\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN STOCK RETURNS<|>EVENT<|>The analysis investigates the impact of greenness and transparency factors on the cross-section of European stock returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENS AND TRANSPARENCY FACTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The greenness and transparency factor is a financial metric used to assess the environmental impact of stocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAGLIARDINI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Gagliardini et al. proposed a procedure for estimating risk premia for observable factors using individual stocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMA AND FRENCH<|>PERSON<|>Fama and French suggested that investors' decisions may be influenced by a 'taste for assets' unrelated to expected returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARHART MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Carhart model is a financial model that includes the greenness and transparency factor in its analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK PREMIUM<|>EVENT<|>The risk premium is the return expected from an investment above the risk-free rate, particularly in relation to the greenness factor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENIUM<|>EVENT<|>The Greenium refers to the phenomenon where investors accept lower compensation for holding environmentally friendly stocks.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN STOCK RETURNS<|>GREENS AND TRANSPARENCY FACTOR<|>The analysis of European stock returns includes the greenness and transparency factor as a key variable<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAGLIARDINI ET AL.<|>CARHART MODEL<|>Gagliardini et al. proposed a method that can be applied to the Carhart model for estimating risk premia<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMA AND FRENCH<|>GREENIUM<|>Fama and French's theories help explain the concept of Greenium in the context of investor behavior<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK PREMIUM<|>GREENIUM<|>The risk premium associated with the greenness factor is directly related to the concept of Greenium<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
