However, it is well known that study outcomes potentially distort the estimates of rg based on the population of published studies. Meta-regression analysis can be used to identify the impact of specification differences on the reported CSP-CFP relationships.\n\nPublication bias involves the estimation of a less subjective approach to the analysis of meta-significance model (MST). Stanley (2001) recommends estimating the following regression:\n\nInfti = &beta;0 + &alpha;ln(dfi) + &epsilon;\n\nwhere ti and dfi denote the t-statistic and degrees of freedom from study i, respectively. The logic behind this test is simple. As sample size rises, the precision of the estimate rises also, and hence, t-statistics also rise. Stanley et al. (2004) show that the slope coefficient in equation (2) offers information on the existence of genuine empirical effects, publication bias, or both: If &alpha; < 0, there is a genuine association between CSP and CFP. If &alpha; > 0, the literature is contaminated by selection effects, or publication bias.\n\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Meta-analysis offers an excellent vehicle for detecting the impact of specification differences (Stanley 2001). In this paper we explore the impact of specification bias through the estimation of two meta-regression analysis models (MRA). The first MRA involves estimation of a general meta-regression model of the form:\n\nSnKin + 01Bil + . + OmBim + u; Toi = 0 + YiXil + YkXik + 81Kil + . + (3)\n\nThe second MRA is an extension of the MST, combining specification differences with meta-significance analysis (known as MSTM-RA): This involves incorporating MRA with MST models, and hence, involves the estimation of a general MST model, that investigates the existence of a genuine union-profit effect, after controlling for specification and data differences:\n\nIn t = do + &1lndf; + 02Zi + &;\n\nEquation 4 is basically an extension of Stanley (2001) to include MRA variables.\n\n# Tableau 4.
