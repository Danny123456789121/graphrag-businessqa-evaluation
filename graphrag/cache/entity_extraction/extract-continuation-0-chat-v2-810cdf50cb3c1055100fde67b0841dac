Therefore, the likelihood of firms experiencing positive financial outcomes from CSR will increase leading to greater engagement with CSR in the long term.\n\n# 5.2 Meta analysis by sample size\n\nWe propose that sample size has an effect on the results of the studies. Orlitzky et al. (2003) listed the sample sizes in each of the 51 papers. In some cases, a range of sample sizes is provided. We have used the smallest sample size in each case to ensure that our results reflect the weakest outcome possible. The intervals for the sample size were chosen to ensure that there were a similar number of studies in each interval. They also show a broadly exponential increase in the upper limit of the sample sizes (see Table IV).\n\nAs the sample size increases, the confidence intervals generally become narrower and the effects generally become more positive. The conclusion that can be drawn from this finding is that the quality of studies in terms of precision and strength improves as sample size increases. This result makes sense, as it is a general statistical property of estimators that they become more precise as the sample size increases.\n\n# 5.3 Meta analysis by methodology\n\nWe propose that the method of analysis has an impact on effect size. Orlitzky et al. (2003) record the measure of CSR and CFP used in each paper, and whether the effect size was derived from a correlation or from a t statistic (see Table V).\n\nThe intervals using t-tests are always wider than the intervals using correlation. This could suggest that correlation methods give more precise results. It may also be simply due to the fact that there are more correlation studies. Furthermore, one of the studies revealed an effect size very close to 1.00, which may skew the results in favour of the correlation methodology.\n\nWe looked at the original papers to see if more detail on the method of analysis was available. Our searches located 34 of the 51 papers. Of these, only two studies used\n\n# Table IV Meta analysis of effect size by sample size\n\n|Sample size|95 per cent CI (pessimistic)|95 per cent CI (optimistic positive)|95 per cent CI (optimistic negative)|Number of papers|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|,10|[0.85, 0.98]|[0.33, 0.74]|[20.37, 0.54]|8|\n|10-19|[20.03, 0.31]|[0.27, 0.68]|[20.27, 0.23]|10|\n|20-49|[20.07, 0.33]|[0.16, 0.81]|[20.51, 0.25]|7|\n|50-99|[0.01, 0.39]|[0.22, 0.52]|[20.07, 0.37]|9|\n|100-199|[20.02, 0.23]|[0.17, 0.53]|[20.06, 0.21]|13|\n|200 +|[0.03, 0.12]|[0.14, 0.18]|[0.03, 0.12]|4|\n|Total|51|51|51|51|\n\n# Table V\n\n# Meta analysis of effect size by methodology employed\n\n|Method|95 per cent CI (pessimistic)|No. of papers|95 per cent CI (optimistic positive)|No. of papers|95 per cent CI (optimistic negative)|No. of papers|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Correlation|[0.05, 0.21]|34|[0.24, 0.41]|33|[20.02, 0.17]|32|\n|t-test|[0.02, 0.23]|17|[0.34, 0.77]|18|[20.17, 0.17]|19|\n|Total|51|51|51|51|51|51|\n\nMethods other than correlation, regression or two-sample tests. These were MANOVA and binomial tests. The effects were found to be generally positive. In terms of the width of the confidence intervals, they appear to become wider as consideration shifts from correlation and t tests and other methods. This may simply be due to the much smaller number of studies using other methodologies.\n\nOur objective here is not to assess which methodology gives the best estimate of effect size in an absolute sense, but to compare the relative performance of methodologies employed. Our conclusion showed that the papers in the meta-analysis that employ t-tests resulted in a wider confidence interval for the effect size than papers employing correlations. Our results do not indicate which methodology provides results that are closest to the true effect size. The results do indicate that t-tests provided more consistent results than other methodologies for the papers in the meta-analysis.\n\n# 6. Modelling the effect of year, sample size and methodology on effect size\n\nThe varying confidence intervals in the meta-analyses above suggest that a model relating effect size to sample size, year and method will reveal which of these three factors has the strongest impact on effect size. Our model is based on a multiple linear regression where sample size is a scale variable, time is a categorical variable measured in five-year intervals, and method is a categorical variable in two categories.\n\nOnce the regression model has been fitted using least squares in SPSS, it is possible\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky et al. is a reference to the authors of a study that analyzes the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to the practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on the world, which is analyzed in the context of its financial outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) is a measure of a company's financial health and is analyzed in relation to CSR in the studies referenced.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPSS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SPSS is a software used for statistical analysis, mentioned in the context of fitting a regression model to analyze the effect of various factors on effect size.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Meta analysis is a statistical technique that combines the results of multiple studies to identify patterns or effects, specifically in the context of CSR and CFP.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Orlitzky et al. conducted a study analyzing the relationship between CSR and CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>CFP<|>Orlitzky et al. conducted a study analyzing the relationship between CSR and CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>The studies analyze how CSR impacts Corporate Financial Performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META ANALYSIS<|>CSR<|>The meta analysis focuses on the effect of CSR on financial outcomes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META ANALYSIS<|>CFP<|>The meta analysis focuses on the effect of CSR on financial outcomes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPSS<|>META ANALYSIS<|>SPSS is used to fit the regression model in the context of the meta analysis<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
