Due to their non-binding nature, shareholder proposals in the U.S. have historically been viewed as a weak mechanism to drive governance reform (Bebchuk, 2005), and while firms have been more responsive to shareholder proposals in recent years, Thomas and Cotter (2007) document that even in cases where the proposal receives a majority vote by shareholders, only 25 percent of proposals in their sample are implemented by the board. In addition, the effectiveness of shareholder proposals in improving board gender diversity has not been examined in the prior literature. It thus becomes an open empirical question as to whether shareholder proposals represent an effective means of achieving desired changes in the gender diversity of corporate boards.\n\nWe address this gap in the literature using a sample of U.S. shareholder proposals related to board gender diversity drawn from the RiskMetrics database over the period 1997 to 2011. We examine the effect of shareholder activism on board gender diversity using a one-to-one matched-sample design, taking advantage of the natural experiment created when shareholder activists target a firm for increased female representation on its corporate board. We focus our analysis on U.S. firms because proposal submissions are far more frequent in the U.S. than in other countries (Cziraki, Renneboog & Szilagyi, 2010; Judge, Gaur, & Muller-Kahle, 2010). Furthermore, the U.S. has not yet taken legislative action to address corporate governance gender imbalances, creating an opportunity for shareholder activists to intervene.\n\nWhile prior literature examining the effectiveness of shareholder proposals has generated mixed results (Goranova & Ryan, 2014), we document that firms targeted by shareholder proposals calling for increased gender diversity on corporate boards experience significantly greater improvements in female board representation, relative to a matched control sample of non-targeted firms. The result from this natural experiment holds in both.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, our findings suggest that shareholder activism is an effective mechanism for increasing female representation on boards. We thus contribute to the corporate governance literatures on both shareholder proposals and board gender diversity by providing, to our knowledge, the first systematic evidence on the effectiveness of shareholder activism in improving female board representation. The paper also speaks to the call for research on alternative efforts to increase board diversity beyond legislative quotas, as voiced by Adams, de Haan, Terjesen, & van Ees (2015). Understanding the potential mechanisms for increasing board diversity is important as significant changes are not likely to occur quickly through organic processes.\n\nWe also examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to board gender diversity, considering the perspectives offered by both agency and institutional theory in our analysis. We find that activists target firms with significantly lower female board representation and firms with less independent boards. We also extend Judge et al. (2010) by conditioning our analysis on shareholder activists’ underlying motivations. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we characterize our sample of proposals as either financially- or socially-motivated based on activist type. We find that socially-motivated shareholder activists target firms with significantly higher levels of board female representation compared to financially-motivated activists, consistent with institutional theory predictions. These insights underscore Judge et al. (2010) recommendation that activist motivation should be taken into account in future research related to shareholder proposals. In addition, while we observe larger percentage increases in female board representation for firms targeted by financially-motivated activists, our statistical tests reveal that financially-motivated and socially-motivated shareholder proposals are equally effective in increasing board gender representation.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We thus conclude that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for achieving corporate governance objectives irrespective of activists’ underlying motivations.\n\nHowever, we note that mean female board representation for firms two years after being targeted – 6 percent (10 percent) for firms targeted with financially-motivated (socially-motivated) proposals – remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups, suggesting that legislative action may still be necessary to achieve current corporate board diversity goals in the U.S.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the theoretical perspectives and prior literature related to board gender diversity and shareholder activism and develop our hypotheses regarding the antecedents of gender diversity-related shareholder activism and its effectiveness. We then describe our research methodology and present our empirical findings. Discussion and conclusions are provided in the final section.\n\n# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES\n\nOur research question addressing the antecedents and ultimate effectiveness of shareholder activism directed toward increasing corporate board gender diversity brings together two disparate streams of the corporate governance literature. However, both the board diversity literature and the shareholder activism literature have shared a reliance on two central theoretical perspectives to structure their investigations – agency theory and institutional theory. We therefore draw on both theoretical perspectives in our literature review and in developing our hypotheses.\n\n# Board Composition and Diversity\n\n# Agency Theory Perspectives\n\nAgency theory (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) is arguably the dominant theoretical framework used within corporate governance research. It stems from\n\nThe separation between ownership (shareholders) and control (managers). This separation provides an opportunity for managers (agents) to act in their own self-interest by maximizing their own utility at the expense of the owners (principals).\n\nFrom an agency theory perspective, the role of corporate boards is to monitor managers on behalf of shareholders, ensuring that shareholders’ interests are pursued (Eisenhardt, 1989). Agency theory recognizes that board incentives to monitor on behalf of shareholders will vary, and board independence, in particular, is viewed as a key attribute in gauging monitoring incentives (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
