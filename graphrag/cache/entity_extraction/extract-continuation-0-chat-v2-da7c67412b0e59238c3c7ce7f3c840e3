They argued that information asymmetries prior to the announcement of additions and deletions might explain this difference. While firms with superior CSP would be likely to publicize pertinent information, firms with deteriorating CSP would tend to withhold such information. Thus, announcements of addition to, or deletion from, a social responsibility index may involve differing degrees of information novelty.\n\nIn view of these arguments, the following hypothesis is proposed:\n\n# H2\n\nAcross the body of event studies, the stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events is stronger than the stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.\n\n# Data and Methodology\n\nMultiple search strategies were employed for this research to collect studies examining the market reactions to positive or negative CEP-related events. First, searches were conducted in major electronic databases (Business Source Complete, Academic Search Complete, EconLit, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) using several combinations of keywords. Second, the reference lists of the studies identified in step one were manually searched (i.e., employing an “ancestry” approach; Aguinis et al. 2011). Finally, the SSRN database was searched to find additional unpublished manuscripts.\n\nIn line with other meta-analyses aggregating the results of event studies, the statistical information provided in the studies has been used to calculate an inverse-variance weighted population r (e.g., Stahl and Voigt 2008). Consequently, to be included in the analysis the studies had to report statistics that allow the calculation of simple correlations. After excluding a number of studies that did not provide the necessary statistical information, the final sample included 32 event studies providing 53 effect sizes based on a total of 8660 observations. The studies included were published between 1990 and 2013. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the analyzed event studies.\n\nIn order to distinguish between market reactions to positive and negative CEP-related events, two separate meta-analyses were conducted. The analysis with regard to positive events was based on 27 effect sizes from 4449 observations. The analysis regarding negative events was\n\nI conceived CEP-related events as incidents referring to environmentally friendly or environmentally harmful corporate actions or behavior. Thus, announcements of environmental regulations were not considered as events in the sense of this study.\n\nKeywords included terms such as environment, environmental, pollution, polluting, ecology, sustainability, performance, market, return, financial, economic, and stock.\n\nFor the employed statistical conversions, see for example Lipsey and Wilson (2001).\n\n|Author(s)|Publication outlet|Year(s) of CEP-related event|Geographical sample region of data|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Ba et al.
