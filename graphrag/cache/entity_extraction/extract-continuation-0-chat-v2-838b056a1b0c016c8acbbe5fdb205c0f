Nevertheless, holding size and BM constant, industry sensitivities differ substantially, indicating that temperature shocks are not merely relevant as spuriously related to size and BM.\n\nThe GMM-based standard errors employed in, among others, Vassalou (2003) and Aretz, Bartram, and Pope (2010) also adjust for errors in variables.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nThe standard errors of the estimated risk premia corresponding to these portfolios. To gauge if our results are robust to the estimation errors of the (factor mimicking) tracking portfolio, we carry out bootstrapping simulations for all instances involving tracking portfolios.\n\nWe randomly permute the time index for the market index returns (MKT) and the Temperature observations jointly. Then we run the tracking portfolio regression to create the TSF from equation (4). Subsequently, we find the loadings on MKT and TSF, and then the risk premia from the second pass cross-sectional regression on the mean returns of the 55 portfolios. We repeat this for 1000 random permutations of the time index for MKT and Temperature to generate the distribution of the estimated risk premia under the null hypothesis that the risk premia are zero. Panel C in Table 6 indicates that, with the 10 industry-size-value portfolios as basis assets, only 32 of the thousand simulations generate a TSF risk premium smaller than the obtained risk premium of -0.02. Thus, the one-sided p-value is 0.03 for the TSF risk premium (compared to p = 0.02 for the errors-in-variables and misspecification-robust approaches).\n\nA similar bootstrapping procedure for the significance of the risk premia for the primary specification is conducted for Table 2 and for the alternative specifications in Table 3. The risk premia remain significant for the primary specification in Table 2 (p = 0.04 for the CAPM+TSF and p = 0.02 for the CAPM+FF). Results for the alternative TSF specifications in Table 3 are similar as those implied by the regular t-statistics except for Alt1 for which the results are no longer significant at the 5 percent level, with p = 0.06.\n\n# 6.3. Tracking portfolio regressions with alternative horizons\n\nSince it is not clear a priori how far ahead financial markets can forecast temperatures, we run a number of tracking portfolio regressions in which we use the: contemporaneous temperature, one-quarter-ahead, two-quarter-ahead, three-quarter-ahead, and four-quarter-ahead.\n\n21\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\naverage temperature as the dependent variable. To remove the seasonality in monthly temperatures, we follow Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and use temperature anomalies, defined relative to the 1951-1980 monthly averages. The results for both the six size-value and the 10 industry-size-value portfolios as basis assets are presented in Panels A and B of Table 7, respectively. First, the contemporaneous temperature does not significantly affect basis asset returns, as the chi-square test cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficients on the basis asset returns are jointly zero. Second, the financial markets can forecast future temperatures, and the adjusted R² increases with the forecasting horizon. The adjusted R² rises from 17% for the one-quarter horizon to 38% (six basis assets case) or 40% (10 basis assets case) for the one-year horizon. This result echoes Roll (1984) who shows that financial markets may be more reliable indicators of future events influencing cash flows than the pronouncements of specialized forecasters: orange juice futures prices have forecasting power for weather conditions (involving frost) beyond the forecasts of the National Weather Service. The evidence thus justifies our tracking portfolio specification.\n\n# 6.4. Global temperatures\n\nShould global temperatures affect U.S. asset returns? Provisionally, the answer is No, invoking the recent climate-economy literature which emphasizes “local” effects of temperature. (For instance, Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014, find that temperatures affect labor supply within a county. That is, a high temperature in a county reduces the labor supply in that county, because “high temperatures cause discomfort, fatigue, and even cognitive impairment”, p. 1). Global temperatures, accordingly, may not impact U.S. asset returns. To test this conjecture, we obtain the global temperature anomalies data from the National Climatic Data Center. The “anomalies” are defined as the temperature minus the average temperature over the 1951-1980 period.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nseasonally adjusted. Figure 3 plots the global and U.S. temperature anomalies. The general trends are similar, but there is considerable difference between U.S. and global temperatures. For instance, the lead article in The Economist of November 28-December 4 2015 notes that the global temperature was the highest in 2014 since NASA temperature recording began in 1880, but the U.S. temperature was not particularly high in that year.\n\nIf the global temperature affects U.S. financial markets, U.S. asset returns should reflect innovations in expectations about future global temperature variation. That is, our (U.S.-based) basis assets should have significant ability to track future global temperature fluctuations. We report the corresponding tracking portfolio regressions in Panel A of Table 8. For robustness, we explore both sets of basis assets. From the chi-square test we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero at the 5% level, regardless of which set of basis assets we use, indicating that the (U.S.-specific) basis assets do not track global temperatures.\n\n# 6.5.
