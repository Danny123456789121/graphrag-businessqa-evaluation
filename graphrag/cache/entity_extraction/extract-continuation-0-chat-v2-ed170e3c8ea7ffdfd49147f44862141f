Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.\n\nThrough a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”. They discussed the multiplexity of the business system and its impact on the CSR concepts in the Chinese context. In particular, they examined the “authorisation capitalism” within the family owned small and medium firms, which suggested that the CSR engagement in these types of firms was oriented to local concern and driven by the local community’s perception of the CSR.\n\n# 2.3.1 Users’ perceived importance of corporate sustainability disclosure in China\n\nWhile existing literature in Chinese CSR has focused more on SOEs, there are also some limited studies that explore CSR practices at non-SOEs. Kuo et al. (2015), for example, suggested that there were no significant differences between environmental disclosure at SOEs and those at the privately owned enterprises. Based on an evaluation of 781 CSR reports between 2008 and 2010, they found the higher disclosure quality in CO2 and SO2 emission was predominantly because of the government-led national strategy; however, other social activities were better reported by privately owned firms.\n\nFrom the theoretical point of view, signalling theory has been getting attention in corporate disclosure studies in recent years, because it assumes that people send and explain signals to reduce information asymmetry (Lin, 2010). The theory considers that information asymmetry typically exists in a capital market. Under this assumption, information obtained from the management level is considered as much more accurate and reliable than information obtained from the market (Shan and Taylor, 2014). Therefore, investors seek information transparency through corporate sustainability information; without it, they cannot respond quickly to make rational decisions about the most effective investment (Shan and Taylor, 2014). It is also assumed that CSD could lower companies’ capital costs (Li et al., 2013) as well as increase sales (Creyer, 1997), market share and brand value (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2005), because firms with a higher degree of sustainability engagement have.\n\nhigher propensity to outperform the non-sustainability performing firms (Dhaliwal et al., 2011).\n\nCompanies that disclose non-financial information signal their willingness to communicate with their stakeholders about sustainability issues that are unknown by the market (Yang, 2011), and companies produce stand-alone reports when the benefit of providing such disclosure outweighs the related costs. Companies with sound performance will deliver their positive image to the public and be distinguished examples among their peers.\n\nThe users of CSD, in general, include a broad range of company stakeholders, such as socially conscious customers, employees, non-governmental organisations, regulators, investors and financial analysts (Cordeiro and Tewari, 2015). In the context of China, signalling theory is relevant for evaluating the users’ perception of CSD in China because most of the ordinary companies in China have no experience and are not willing to disclose voluntary sustainability information (Shan and Taylor, 2014). However, they have increasingly received significant pressure from the public, the government and industrial associations, to disclose.\n\nFor companies that have produced sustainability reports, and those that plan to do so, it is still not clear which sustainability indicators are considered important to disclose by the report users in China. Only if users perceive a strong and significant relationship between relevant indicators in sustainability reports and long-term corporate performance, they will find the data in the reports as useful. Therefore, understanding users’ perceived importance of CSD is essential.\n\nThis provides motivations to us to assess the level of importance of the CSD in China from the users’ perspective. Considering that GRI guidelines are mostly used in China for sustainability reporting, in this study, we use sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to evaluate users’ perceived importance of each of the indicators. Respondents in this study are asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. The data are accordingly analysed to reflect the users’ perceived level of importance of the corporate environmental, economic and social information disclosures.\n\n# 2.3.2 Chinese report users’ perspective on Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability indicators.\n\nWhile GRI guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reporting, there have been some concerns regarding the potentially different perceptions of the level of importance of the indicators listed on the GRI guidelines. Wang and Juslin (2009), for example, based on their literature study on terms of differences between the West and East contexts, claim that Western corporate sustainability concepts do not adapt well to the Chinese market, because they have rarely defined the primary reason for corporate sustainability. The ethic approach to the corporate sustainability concept does not take the Chinese reality and culture into consideration. They point out that corporate sustainability is a term that may be legitimately interpreted within the Chinese corporate culture. However, Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasise the “cultivation of virtue and morality, as well\n\nas the core of its harmony notion” (Wang and Juslin, 2009, p. 446), offer a better understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context. Accordingly, there may be some of the indicators listed on GRI guidelines that are not relevant within the Chinese context, and hence, they are not considered as necessary by the Chinese report users.
