Finally, ethics and citizenship (TC5) are considered the least influencing sub-criteria with a score of 0.1324. Thus, sustainability supports knowledge creation and sharing, which, in turn, eases communication within organizations. To make a proactive sustainability strategy realistic, Kim and Ji [99] suggested that corporations aiming for a proactive sustainability strategy must consider the communication of a shared vision within an organization and among the company’s stakeholders. When companies communicate their visions related to sustainability, they improve their reputation which increases stakeholders’ interests in such organizations. Moreover, Dyllick and Muff [100] stated that corporate sustainability mission and vision statements should be adopted to convey corporate commitment throughout the corporation.\n\n# Transparency and Communication\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107.

Companies need to address sustainability due to it inspires commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.\n\n# Economics\n\nThe outcomes showed the sub-attribute ranking: ECO4>ECO2>ECO6>ECO5>ECO1>ECO3, as seen in Figure 10.
