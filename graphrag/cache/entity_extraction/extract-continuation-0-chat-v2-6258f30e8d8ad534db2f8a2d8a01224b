The independence of the board of directors (Board Independence) is measured as the percentage of board members who are classified as independent, defined as a person neither affiliated nor currently an employee of the company, at year t-1.\n\nFollowing Judge et al. (2010) and Ertimur et al. (2011), we control for Firm Size, defined as the log of total assets, and Profitability, defined as return-on-assets or income before extraordinary items divided by total assets. Judge et al. (2010) note that prior profitability is higher for firms targeted with social proposals. Therefore, we expect a positive coefficient for both Firm Size and Profitability, although the coefficient for Firm Size is expected to be significantly lower than it would otherwise be if we had not already matched on size. We also control for board structure in equation (1) as this constitutes an internal governance mechanism that may affect shareholder activism (Judge et al. 2010). For example, Wu (2004) and Ertimur et al. (2011) find that smaller boards are more likely to be targeted by shareholder activists, while Carter et al. (2003) document a positive association between female board representation and board size. We therefore control for Board Size, measured as the number of board members, but make no prediction regarding its effect on the.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Adding a female board member may be more feasible for larger boards, but attaining higher female representation is also more difficult for them. As indicated in equation (1), all independent variables are measured at year t-1.\n\nErtimur et al. (2011) also report a marginally positive association between shareholder activism and CEO duality; i.e., shareholders are more likely to target firms with CEOs who also serve as the board chairman. We therefore include a variable for duality to control for this effect. CEO Duality is defined as an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO also serves as the chair of the board, and zero otherwise. Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) find that when the CEO is a member of the nominating committee, the board tends to be less independent, which may attract activism. We thus include the indicator variable CEO on the Nominating Committee to control for this possible effect, where CEO on the Nominating Committee equals one if the CEO serves on the nominating committee, and zero otherwise.\n\nBoard characteristics are obtained from RiskMetrics, and financial data are obtained from Compustat. Both variables are measured at year t-1.\n\n# 4. Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for the variables of interest are reported in Table 4, Panel A. Female board representation is generally very low. The mean (median) Female Representation is only 2.9 percent (0.0 percent) for firm-years targeted with diversity proposals during 1997–2011, compared with 10.2 percent (11.1 percent) for the sample of matched control firms over the same period. This percentage is even lower for firms targeted by financially-motivated activists: here the mean (median) Female Representation is only 1.0 percent (0.0 percent). Targeted firms also have lower board independence, with mean (median) Board Independence of 61.1 percent (62.5 percent) compared with 70.4 percent (73.9 percent) for the matched controls. Targeted firms also tend to be more profitable (mean Profitability of 6.4 percent versus 3.4 percent), have smaller boards (mean of 8.89 versus...\n\n9.79), and are less likely to have CEOs in dual chairman roles (0.64 versus 0.70) than the non-targeted controls. Regarding differences between firms targeted by financially- versus socially-motivated activists, the former tend to be smaller, more profitable, have smaller boards, are more likely to have CEO/COB duality, and are less likely to have their CEO on the nominating committee relative to the latter.\n\n# 9. Panel B of Table 4\n\nIn Panel B of Table 4, we present Pearson correlation coefficients for the target analysis variables. The highest correlation coefficient is between Firm Size and Board Size ( = 0.59). In addition, both firm size and board size are highly correlated with female representation ( = 0.35 and = 0.34, respectively). To assess collinearity, we compute the condition numbers of the matrices of explanatory variables. According to Judge, Griffiths, Hill, Luetkepohl et al. (1985), condition numbers between 30 and 100 indicate moderate to strong dependencies. The highest condition number for our models is 21, indicating that collinearity is not a serious problem.\n\n------------------------------- Insert Table 4 about here -------------------------------\n\n# 10. Table 5\n\nIn Table 5, we present results from our logistic binary regression of target firm antecedents. To control for the influence of outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables Firm Size and Profitability at 1 percent and 99 percent. In Model 1, we estimate a baseline model using just the control variables and find that Firm Size and Profitability are significantly positively associated with shareholder activism, while Board Size and CEO Duality are negatively associated. In Model 2, the variables of interest are added. Consistent with H1a and H2a, we find that firms with high existing levels of female board representation and high levels of board independence are significantly less likely to be targeted by gender diversity proposals. The estimated α coefficients on Female Representation and Board Independence are -16.67 and -2.18, both significant at the 0.01 level.
