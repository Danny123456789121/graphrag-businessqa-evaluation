Different from above viewpoints related to stakeholder theory and the resource-based view, our signaling perspective emphasizes the signaling role of CSR practices in dealing with information asymmetry. Specifically, by integrating empirical results across 28 empirical studies, we make conclusions about the overall value of CSR in driving business performance in East Asia. We show that CSR is, indeed, a valuable business strategy in the East Asian context. Moreover, our meta-analysis reveals that environmental CSR has a stronger positive effect on firm performance than does social CSR. Distinguishing between environmental and social aspects of CSR is important because they involve two different groups of stakeholders and have different Western/Asian relative strengths. Our unique research findings emphasize the value of environmental CSR signals in East Asia and enrich the CSR literature. Following Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986) and Hult et al. (2008), we decompose business performance into financial (financial and market indicators) and operational (competitive and societal indicators) performance, to examine CSR’s distinct influence on each type of business performance. The approach enables us to compare distinct CSR impacts on financial vs. operational performance, and gain a more comprehensive understanding of CSR’s value in East Asian contexts. The results indicate that CSR exerts a relatively small influence on financial performance and that CSR endeavors can allow firms enjoy stronger operational performance. The findings are important and timely as they strengthen our understanding of CSR’s effects in East Asia, where business is characterized by fast growth, fierce environmental problems, and savage competition.\n\nSecond, this paper adopts the institutional theory to explore the contingencies of CSR-performance relationship. Drawing on stakeholder theory, natural resource-based view (NRBV), and other theoretical lenses, previous studies have found the positive effects of CSR practices on business performance (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010). However, they neglected the moderating role of institutional environments. From the combined view of signaling theory and institutional theory, we argue that the positive effect of CSR practices signals may vary in different contexts. When the institutional system is deficient, CSR signals can resolve the information asymmetry more effectively. Similarly, the phenomenon of information asymmetry is more prominent in SMEs and private firms. Therefore, CSR signals are more valuable for these firms. In contrast, as the institutional environment becomes more perfect and firm’s information is easily to access (e.g., developed regions and public firms), the signaling role of CSR practices will become less valuable because stakeholders can access other non-CSR information to evaluate firms. Specifically, following Barnett and Salomon’s (2012) call for exploring additional contingencies in the relationship between CSP and CFP, we undertook this meta-analytic review to examine the prediction of stakeholder theory in various contexts. Different levels and types of contingencies allow us to understand the contextual and methodological moderators between CSR and business performance in East Asia more comprehensively. First, we find that economic development moderates CSR effects on business performance. This indicates that CSR is a better approach for firms in developing regions to improve business performance, consistent with the argument that CSR may depend on the economic environment along with different levels of institution and legal development (Arya & Zhang, 2009). This research finding enriches the literature of CSR and the institutional theory. We also show that firm size moderates.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nThe effect of CSR on business performance: SMEs rely more on CSR than do non-SMEs to gain necessary resource support and legitimacy from outside, a finding consistent with Dixon-Fowler et al. (2012). Additionally, we find that organizational form moderates CSR effect on business performance. Consistent with our prediction, CSR is more beneficial for private firms than for public firms, perhaps because most public firms perform CSR according to regular norms, but the few private firms that actively participate in CSR are differentiated once stakeholders and society as a whole know about their CSR endeavors.\n\nThird, we find that using archival data has different outcomes than using self-report measures. Specifically, self-report measures have a larger effect size. As a result, our findings diverge from Dixon-Fowler et al. (2012). Future scholars are encouraged to adopt appropriate CSR measures for different research motivations. In addition, current CSR literature rarely takes longitudinal research into consideration because of the difficulty of data collecting (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2012). We try to explore the evolution of CSR in East Asia regions with the help of meta-regression. However, the results failed to demonstrate a significant regressive effect.\n\n# Practical implications\n\nThis research may provide some useful guidelines regarding CSR endeavors for managers of Asian firms. CSR activities require substantial investment and can be costly (Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Thus, understanding whether and under what conditions CSR enhances business performance is financially meaningful to East Asian managers who have been practicing or are being advised to practice CSR. This study argues that organizations adopt CSR activities to transfer good and green signals to outside stakeholders, solve the information asymmetry, and get positive responses from stakeholders. For instance, public firms and large firms are used to disclose their CSR reports every year. Several restaurants in China are pleased to show the cooking process to diners (green signals) in order to demonstrate the transparency and safety of their food. Our meta-analytic review indicates that CSR is a strategic signal East Asian firms can use to enhance business performance, especially for gaining competitive indicators such as reputation and innovation, and social indicators such as employee loyalty and customer satisfaction, indicating that CSR activities are strategically worthwhile investments. Managers in East Asia should focus on environmental CSR because it is more important than social CSR in the East Asian context. However, CSR is not a panacea for improving business performance because it is contextually relied. For instance, our research findings suggest SMEs in developing Asian countries, especially\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>GEO<|>East Asia is a region characterized by fast growth, fierce environmental problems, and savage competition, where CSR practices are evaluated for their impact on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on society, which is shown to enhance business performance in East Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMEs<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) rely more on CSR practices than larger firms to gain necessary resource support and legitimacy from stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Public firms are companies that have sold shares to the public and are subject to regulatory norms, often performing CSR according to standard practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIVATE FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Private firms are companies owned by individuals or groups that do not sell shares to the public, and they may engage in CSR more actively to differentiate themselves.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Dixon-Fowler et al. are researchers whose work has contributed to the understanding of CSR practices and their effects on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENKATRAMAN AND RAMANUJAM<|>PERSON<|>Venkatraman and Ramanujam are researchers referenced for their work on business performance metrics in relation to CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HULT ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Hult et al. are researchers whose studies are cited in the context of CSR and its impact on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHIVAL DATA<|>EVENT<|>Archival data refers to historical data collected for research purposes, which can yield different outcomes compared to self-report measures in CSR studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-REPORT MEASURES<|>EVENT<|>Self-report measures are surveys or assessments where individuals report their own CSR practices, often showing larger effect sizes in studies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>EAST ASIA<|>CSR practices are evaluated for their impact on business performance specifically in the context of East Asia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMEs<|>CSR<|>SMEs rely more on CSR practices than non-SMEs to gain necessary resource support and legitimacy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLIC FIRMS<|>CSR<|>Public firms perform CSR according to regular norms, which may limit their differentiation in CSR practices<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRIVATE FIRMS<|>CSR<|>Private firms that actively participate in CSR can differentiate themselves from public firms<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Dixon-Fowler et al. have conducted research that explores the effects of CSR practices on business performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VENKATRAMAN AND RAMANUJAM<|>CSR<|>Venkatraman and Ramanujam's work is referenced in relation to the metrics of business performance influenced by CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HULT ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Hult et al. are cited for their contributions to understanding CSR's impact on business performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIVAL DATA<|>SELF-REPORT MEASURES<|>Archival data and self-report measures yield different outcomes in CSR research, affecting the understanding of CSR's impact<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
