This is further evidence that high carbon emissions lead to high abnormal excess returns for our sample.\n\n19\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 8.3 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Firms\n\nOur analysis uses data on 65 of the 80 firms included in the DAX and MDAX stock indexes. We exclude the 15 firms for which we do not have monthly return observations for the full sample period. For robustness, we also assess the performance of the carbon portfolios when all 80 stocks are included in the analysis. We do so by using all available data on all stocks, where for 15 stocks the data available is shorter than the full sample. This approach implies that the composition of the portfolios changes over time. The effect of the inclusion of additional stocks on the portfolio composition is as follows: the dirty portfolio still has the same 8 stocks; the medium portfolio now has a maximum of 21 stocks, which is 5 stocks more than previously; and the clean portfolio has a maximum of 51 stocks, which is 10 more stocks.\n\nTable 7 shows that the results remain qualitatively the same and, overall, the carbon premium is in fact slightly higher. For the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, the 80-stock cross-section delivers a highly significant carbon premium relative to the CAPM of 18.6% compared to 16.8% for the 65-stock cross-section. For the full sample period of November 2003 to December 2012, the carbon premium is 4.4% relative to 2.9% previously. For Phase I it is 17.6% compared to 15.3% previously. Finally, for Phase II it is 7.1% compared to 8.2% previously. In conclusion, therefore, our main findings are not affected by the inclusion of additional stocks for which the available data does not cover the full sample.\n\n# 9 Extension: Evidence from the UK\n\nIn this section we provide an empirical investigation of the carbon premium for a second major European economy: the UK. This allows us to assess whether the carbon premium is predominantly a feature of the German economy or a feature that is also present elsewhere in Europe. For this purpose, we build a second data set on carbon emission allowances that is specific to the UK. In particular, we focus on the 100 UK firms that belong to the FTSE 100 stock index, which capture more than 80% of the UK stock market capitalization.\n\nIn similar fashion to the German data, the UK data on carbon emission allowances have been collected manually. We use the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) database set up by the European Commission to manually match each production facility.\n\n(installation) to the Örm it belongs to. This is a painstaking process as some Örms have numerous installations, often with di§erent names, each receiving a di§erent number of carbon allowances. All these installations are then manually matched to the parent Örm that is listed in the stock exchange. Finally, we aggregate across installations for each Örm to determine the total number of free EUAs issued to each UK Örm.\n\nArmed with these data, we build a dirty portfolio of all 16 Örms that have received carbon allowances and a clean portfolio of all 67 Örms that did not receive any carbon allowances. Hence we use data for 83 of the 100 Örms for which we have monthly return observations for the full sample period of November 2003 to December 2012. Note that for the UK data we place all dirty Örms in one portfolio and hence we do not distinguish between dirty and medium Örms. This is because in the UK there are very few Örms with a large number of carbon allowances. For instance, had we deÖned dirty Örms as those receiving more than one million allowances, then only four Örms would satisfy this criterion. Indeed, the majority of the 16 dirty Örms received no more than 100,000 allowances. Furthermore, the market value of the average UK dirty Örm is lower than in Germany and, therefore, the average UK dirty Örm needs less carbon allowances than in Germany. Therefore, our analysis is based on the argument that the distinct structure of the UK market justiÖes placing all dirty Örms in one portfolio.\n\nIn the asset pricing regressions, we use data on UK Fama-French factors provided by the XÖ Centre for Finance and Investment at the University of Exeter. These data are speciÖcally constructed for the UK economy and are discussed in Gregory, Tharayan and Christidis (2013).\n\nOur main Önding is that the UK results are qualitatively similar to the German results. Figure 7 plots the rolling carbon premium for the UK and shows the striking similarity between Germany and the UK. The Ögure reveals that the timing for the carbon premium in Germany and the UK is the same: the carbon premium begins at the end of 2003, grows dramatically during Phase I, diminishes in Phase II and disappears after 2009. Table 8 reports more detailed results. Notably the UK carbon premium is high and signiÖcant in Phase I but not for the other sample periods. Overall, this empirical evidence conÖrms the presence of a carbon premium in the UK that lasted for as long as it did in Germany.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 10 Discussion and Conclusions\n\nThe EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for regulating carbon emissions. At the center of this scheme is the creation of a new market for trading carbon emission allowances.
