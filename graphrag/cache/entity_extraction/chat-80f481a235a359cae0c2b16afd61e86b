In this paper, it is our intention to describe how the strategic relevance of sustainability management may be improved (i.e., in the sense that both business success and sustainable development may be reinforced). This line of reasoning follows the approach of Korhonen, who distinguished between two different levels of sustainability theory: that of generating favorable planning and management outcomes with respect to sustainable development, and that of concrete and practical action (Korhonen, 2004). The propositions presented in this paper relate explicitly to the first level. Hence, the main objective of this research is a) to reflect upon the link between sustainability-oriented management and the attainment of sustainable development goals, and b) to improve the strategic relevance of management approaches in the sense mentioned above. The intention is to overcome a central limitation of current corporate sustainability management and CSR, namely, the difficulties inherent in identifying and attaining goals that contribute significantly to sustainable.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\ndevelopment. Specific propositions are formulated related to sustainability-oriented practices and goals that can help overcome these barriers and provide support for decision makers during the strategic implementation and execution of sustainability management.\n\nThe following research questions are addressed in this paper:\n\n1. How can a strategic perspective of corporate sustainability management be conceptualized?\n2. How can strategic success of corporate sustainability management be defined?\n3. How can corporations act more sustainably from a strategic point of view?\n\nTo answer the first research question, three strategy perspectives (i.e., strategy process, strategy content and strategy context) are introduced, and the relationships that can be correlated with corporate sustainability management are defined. To answer the second research question, the potential effects of corporate sustainability activities on the individual corporation, the business sector, the society and the natural environment are analyzed. To answer the third research question, the process dimension is operationalized. Key propositions are then presented to exemplify the answers to the research questions (see sections 3 and 4). In addition, an example for each key proposition is presented; however, the propositions themselves need to be verified through future research.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: three strategic perspectives are introduced and discussed in section 2; the outcomes and impacts of corporate sustainability management with respect to business and society are described in section 3; an analysis of the process dimension of corporate sustainability management appears in section 4; and the research results are interpreted and discussed in section 5.\n\n# 2 Strategic perspectives of corporate sustainability management\n\nIn the context of business management research and practice, Hinterhuber (2004) defines strategy as a way of using the resources and capabilities of an organization. Boddy (2005) describes strategy as a way to decide what business an organization should be in, where it wants to be and how it is going to operate. Strategic management theory distinguishes between the market-based view of strategic management (Porter, 1980), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991), the emergent strategies view (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985) and the relational view (Dyer and Singh 1998).\n\nIn general, the use of the term ‘strategic’ implies that there is an overall goal, or some specific vision concerning the nature of success. All actors and their actions contribute to a common vision, an overall goal. A plan for attaining the\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\ndefined goals under conditions of uncertainty is named a ‘strategy’, and ‘strategic’ can, thus, be employed to describe anything that is believed to contribute to strategy implementation and goal attainment (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010).\n\nAs used in this paper, the term ‘strategic perspective’ sheds light on two important aspects of corporate sustainability management:\n\n1. The aspect of the goals and benefits of corporate sustainability management. Usually, environmental and social goals are embodied in all approaches to sustainability management. However, the question of who specifically will benefit from sustainability management is subject to much less discussion. For example, which individual, group, organization, or system is expected to be better off after the implementation of corporate sustainability management?\n2. The aspect of how to implement corporate sustainability management. This is related to the process of identifying sustainability-related goals and determining how they may be implemented in an organization. Since the notion of sustainability often lacks clarity and can be subject to many forms of interpretation, the identification of appropriate goals and their effective and efficient implementation are challenging tasks in any type of organization.\n\nBy way of providing a theoretical starting point, three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management are used here: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context (Pettigrew, 1987; De Wit and Meyer, 2004). These dimensions were first introduced into the field of sustainability science by Baumgartner and Korhonen (2010).\n\nStrategy process, content and context are distinct, but interrelated, components of strategy. These three dimensions provide a framework to explain and interpret strategic thinking in the present paper. Developing a strategy for a company entails the definition of the content of a strategy. Specifically, the ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ of strategic activities with respect to specific external and internal factors (the context) must be determined. The starting point for this process is the ‘why’; the purpose of the whole endeavor must be ascertained. The purpose can be, for example, to develop economically efficient and ecologically sustainable products. The three strategy dimensions may be defined as follows:\n\n- The strategy process itself comprises the construction and development phase of a strategy.\n- The conditions surrounding strategic activities are the strategy context. The context influences the possibilities and limitations of the strategy. For example, regulations, natural resource scarcities, or pressures/innovations arising from NGOs can impose limits on, or provide opportunities for, organizations and communities.\n- The strategy\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
