First, regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions tend to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples (positive events: r = .053, 95 % CI: .001 to –.106 for US samples vs. r = .092, 95 % CI: .008 to –.175 for non-US samples, negative events: r = -.164, 95 % CI: -.230 to -.096 vs. r = -.228, 95 % CI: -.339 to -.110). Second, while the population rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000, the r regarding positive events before the year 2000 was not significant (r = .032, 95 % CI: -.054 to –.117), contrary to the r pertaining to positive events as of the year 2000 (r = .077, 95 % CI: .023 to –.131). Finally, for negative events, both the r calculated from studies which controlled for confounding events as well as the r derived from studies not accounting for this issue were significant (r = -.139, 95 % CI: -.22 to -.054 and r = -.219, 95 % CI: -.298 to -.137). For positive events, only the r calculated from studies that controlled for confounding events was significant (r = .093, 95 % CI: .030 to –.156). To some extent these partially non-significant effects regarding positive events may be a further indication that the stock market reactions to negative events are more robust and generalizable than those to positive events.\n\n# Discussion and Conclusion\n\nSeveral studies examined the market reactions to CEP-related events and yielded mixed results. In an attempt to reconcile this inconsistency, the current work accumulated the empirical evidence of 29 event studies by means of meta-analysis. This study adds to the established body of cumulative evidence concerning the CEP–CFP link as it complements the existing meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014), which did not incorporate event study findings. Overall, my results corroborate the existing meta-analytic evidence of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP by demonstrating.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nthat there is a positive market reaction to positive CEP-related events and a negative reaction to negative events. Moreover, due to the nature of event studies, these meta-analytically derived estimates indicate a positive causal impact of CEP on CFP. CEP-related events indeed appear to alter the market’s perception of firms’ net present values of future profits and cash flows (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). However, what is not clear from the current meta-analysis is the exact reason why CEP-related events change the stock market’s perception of future firm value. Along the lines of the NRBV and the stakeholder theory, it could be argued that CEP-related events are effective in signaling a firm’s competitive resources and capabilities and its potential effectiveness in meeting stakeholder demands. Nevertheless, which potential benefits from superior CEP and which detriments from poor CEP are in particular valued or punished by the market remains to be established.\n\nFurthermore, the findings suggest that there is asymmetry in the stock market reactions with stronger reactions to negative than to positive CEP-related events. The asymmetry can be explained in the light of the so-called negativity bias, a pattern that may be “one of the most basic and far-reaching psychological principles” (Baumeister et al. 2001, p. 362). To this end, the findings are in line with insights from economic psychology indicating asymmetric evaluations of potential losses and gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Hence, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events might just mirror a general cognitive pattern. However, from a more specific point of view, it can be argued that negative CEP-related events such as announcements of violations of environmental laws (e.g., Karpoff et al. 1998) or toxic releases (e.g., Hamilton 1995) demonstrate poor CEP in a clear and explicit manner. Thus, negative CEP-related events appear to constitute strong and (adversely) value-relevant signals for the shareholders. Contrarily, positive CEP-related events such as announcements of green supply chain initiatives (Bose and Pal 2012) or engagement in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program (Keele and DeHart 2011) strictly speaking may just represent a firm’s efforts not necessarily implying\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Environmental Performance (CEP) refers to a firm's efforts and practices related to environmental sustainability and responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) refers to the financial outcomes and profitability of a firm.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
