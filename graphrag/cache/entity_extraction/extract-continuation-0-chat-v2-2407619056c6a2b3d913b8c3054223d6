When combined with other technologies, automation overall could contribute 0.5 to 3.4 percent annually to productivity growth, assuming labor is redeployed at today’s productivity levels and not including general equilibrium effects.\n\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*NET; McKinsey analysis\n\nWe assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. Our analysis covers 47 countries representing more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net data set that maps about 850 occupations to approximately 2,100 detailed work activities.\n\nEach detailed work activity was assessed against 18 capabilities that could potentially be automated based on the level of performance necessary to successfully perform that activity. These assessments were informed by academic research, McKinsey expertise, and industry experts. We defined four possible levels of requirement for each capability, ranging from not required to top-quartile human performance. Please refer to exhibits A1 to A4 of the technical appendix in the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, *A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity* for more details on the capabilities and the four requirement levels.5\n\n# 1. Modeling of automation adoption timelines\n\nOur adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity level for more than 850 occupations across 19 sectors and 47 countries that represent more than 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process into four phases: technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-user adoption.\n\n# Technical feasibility\n\nFor a detailed work activity to be automated, technology must exist that performs at the required level for each of the 18 capabilities. To update the progression scenarios for the performance capabilities over time, we surveyed experts in generative AI. We also conducted interviews with industry leaders and academic experts. Based on these assessments, we updated the expected time frames to reach each level of performance for each capability. In our analysis and interaction with experts, we focused on the following capabilities that could be affected by generative AI:\n\n- Natural-language understanding\n- Natural-language generation\n- Social and emotional reasoning\n- Emotional and social output\n- Social and emotional sensing\n- Coordination with multiple agents\n- Generating novel patterns or categories\n- Creativity\n\n5 Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages, McKinsey Global Institute, November 28, 2017.\n\n# Logical reasoning and problem solving\n\n# Output articulation or display\n\n# Sensory perception\n\n# Solution development\n\nWe also updated our estimates for how long it would take to develop a solution that could integrate automation technologies once technical feasibility was established, based on a series of expert interviews. The original estimates were developed by examining the development time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed automation solutions, including hardware and software solutions.\n\n# Economic feasibility\n\nOnce a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost of the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this calculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.\n\n# Solution cost evolution\n\nBased on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware and software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross motor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as a software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled.\n\nWe estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using different mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions have relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that require a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. To be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only from very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality and efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 to 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to 20 percent for software.\n\nIn our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs decline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. We triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in hardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to estimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer price index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software and accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution costs, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual reductions have little impact on final automation results.\n\n# Wage evolution\n\nWe model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply country-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US dollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 base) and multiply the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is a government agency that provides data on labor economics and statistics, including employment and wage information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that provides insights and analysis on economic and business trends, including automation and productivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can generate text, images, and other content, significantly impacting labor productivity and automation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL ECONOMY<|>GEO<|>The global economy encompasses all economic activities and transactions that occur across countries, representing a significant portion of the world's economic output.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>O*NET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>O*NET is a comprehensive database of occupational information in the United States, mapping occupations to work activities and skills required.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TECHNICAL AUTOMATION<|>EVENT<|>Technical automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intervention, particularly in the context of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMIC RESEARCH<|>EVENT<|>Academic research involves systematic investigation and study conducted by scholars to advance knowledge in various fields, including automation and AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>47 COUNTRIES<|>GEO<|>The analysis covers 47 countries, representing a significant portion of the global economy, assessing the potential for automation across various sectors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS<|>O*NET<|>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data that is utilized by O*NET to map occupations to work activities and skills<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The McKinsey Global Institute conducts research on the impact of generative AI on productivity and labor markets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>TECHNICAL AUTOMATION<|>Generative AI is a key driver of technical automation, enhancing capabilities that can be automated<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>47 COUNTRIES<|>GLOBAL ECONOMY<|>The analysis of automation potential covers 47 countries, which together represent a significant portion of the global economy<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMIC RESEARCH<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>Academic research informs the insights and analysis provided by the McKinsey Global Institute on automation and productivity<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
