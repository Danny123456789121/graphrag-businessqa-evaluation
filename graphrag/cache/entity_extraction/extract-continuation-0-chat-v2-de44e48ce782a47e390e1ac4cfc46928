Furthermore, many of the industries in Table 4 with strong negative\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nExposures to the temperature shock factor are non-manufacturing industries such as Finance, Retail, and Meals, with obviously low carbon-dioxide emissions. These observations do not support the “untoward regulation” explanation.\n\nWe also carry out a more formal test. If concerns about regulation drive temperature sensitivity, firms headquartered in states run by Democrats should be more exposed to temperature shocks than firms headquartered in states run by Republicans, given the different climate policies advocated by the two parties. We thus form size-value as well as industry portfolios within Republican and Democrat states, and run time-series regressions to examine if firms in Republican states are less negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in Democrat states.\n\nThe results are in Table 10. The “Industry portfolios” section shows that in all five industries, the loadings on the temperature shock factor are not significantly less negative for firms in the Republican states. E.g., for manufacturing firms the loading on the factor is -3.66 (t = -1.75) for firms in Republican states but -2.95 (t = -2.43) for firms in Democrat states. The results for the size-value portfolios are in the “Size-value portfolios” section and suggest that temperature shocks in general do not have less negative impact on stock returns of firms in Republican states.\n\n# 7. Summary and Implications\n\nHow do US equity markets react to news contained in US temperature changes? Tracking portfolios formed from basis assets distinguished by value, size, and/or industry have significant value in filtering the economic importance of persistent temperature changes inferred from temperature shocks. We hypothesize that (i) a significant risk premium exists on a temperature tracking portfolio, (ii) its impact on the cost of equity capital, at least until recently, has been.\n\n26\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nincreasing over time, and (iii) loadings at the industry level on this tracking portfolio are generally negative and more so for industries considered to be more sensitive to climate change.\n\nOn the whole we are able to confirm the hypotheses and infer, taking the average risk premium, that the cross-sectional average cost of equity capital is 0.22 percentage points higher on an annual basis as a result of uncertainty related to future temperatures.\n\nThe severity of impact and even the existence of climate change are heavily debated, and it is difficult to obtain an objective perspective. For this purpose, financial markets may be helpful in uncovering true perceptions as they aggregate the beliefs of market participants who do not merely offer opinions but have “skin in the game.” So, what does the result we find from the U.S. equity market data, that the uncertainty about temperature changes contributes an annual average of 0.22 percentage points to costs of capital, say about costs of climate change?\n\nA convenient means of capitalizing the one-period impact to account for the long run present value costs of temperature shocks is to use the Gordon growth model approximation arising when we equate asset prices with the expected net present value of future dividends, and proxy the associated variables by setting the dynamic paths of dividends, dividend growth, and costs of capital equal to their averages. Aggregate stock market values can then be expressed as P=D/(R−G), in which P is the current stock market price index, D the end-of-period expected dividends (considered a constant proportion of GDP), G the average anticipated growth rate of dividends, and R the average cost of equity capital. We are then able to draw the following conclusions by placing our results in the context of the existing literature:\n\n1. Henry (2003) finds an approximate one-to-one relationship between the cost of capital and GDP growth. This is consistent with the Gordon growth perspective in which the impact of a change in the cost of capital is equivalent to the impact of an opposite change in the\n\n27\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\ngrowth rate of dividends or output: %∆P/∆R=−%∆P/∆G. Accordingly, the stock market wealth impact of the 0.22 percent increase in the cost of equity capital (based on the full-sample primary specification) is equivalent to that of a 0.22 percent reduction in the growth rate of dividends or GDP. Our explanation for the reduction in the GDP growth rate answers Dell, Jones and Olken’s (2014) call for mechanisms explaining the empirical temperature-growth linkage. It also provides a perspective, showing that the impact of temperature fluctuations on the cost of equity capital alone is of higher magnitude than the total policy cost of mitigation, an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage (IPCC, 2014), which allows room to contemplate more aggressive climate-change mitigation policies.\n\n(2) The Gordon growth approximation also implies that %∆P=−(P/D∆R. If we set) P/D (the price-dividend ratio) equal to 36, which is its average value over our sample period from March 1953 to December 2014 (see Robert Shiller’s website) then the present value of the cost of temperature shocks is 36 x 0.22% = 7.92%. To put our estimate of a 7.92 percent loss due to climate change in the perspective of previous estimates, consider that: the literature has considered mainly the specific present value costs of permanent losses in GDP due to abrupt climate change in future years, and, more recently, the costs of losses in GDP related to extreme weather resulting from climate changes. The estimated cost of climate change based on these mechanisms varies from around 0.2% to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>US EQUITY MARKETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>US equity markets react to news contained in US temperature changes and aggregate beliefs of market participants regarding climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK FACTOR<|>EVENT<|>The temperature shock factor refers to sudden changes in temperature that can impact various industries and their stock returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The finance industry is one of the non-manufacturing sectors that may be affected by temperature shocks, with low carbon-dioxide emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETAIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The retail industry is another non-manufacturing sector that is observed to have low carbon-dioxide emissions and may be impacted by temperature changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The meals industry is categorized as a non-manufacturing sector with low carbon-dioxide emissions, potentially affected by temperature shocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GORDON GROWTH MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The Gordon growth model is a financial model used to estimate the present value of an asset based on expected future dividends and growth rates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL<|>EVENT<|>The cost of equity capital is the return required by investors to compensate for the risk of investing in a company's equity, which can be influenced by temperature changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GDP<|>EVENT<|>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of economic activity that can be affected by changes in temperature and climate policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENRY (2003)<|>PERSON<|>Henry (2003) is a researcher who found a relationship between the cost of capital and GDP growth, relevant to the discussion of temperature impacts on the economy.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US EQUITY MARKETS<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK FACTOR<|>US equity markets react to changes in temperature, indicating a relationship between market performance and temperature shocks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCE<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK FACTOR<|>The finance industry is impacted by temperature shocks, as indicated by its low carbon-dioxide emissions and sensitivity to climate changes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RETAIL<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK FACTOR<|>The retail industry may experience effects from temperature shocks, similar to other non-manufacturing sectors<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEALS<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK FACTOR<|>The meals industry, being a non-manufacturing sector, is also potentially affected by temperature changes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK FACTOR<|>The cost of equity capital is influenced by uncertainty related to temperature changes, affecting investor returns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDP<|>COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL<|>Changes in the cost of equity capital can impact GDP growth rates, as indicated by the Gordon growth model<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENRY (2003)<|>COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL<|>Henry (2003) established a link between the cost of capital and GDP growth, relevant to the discussion of economic impacts from temperature changes<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
