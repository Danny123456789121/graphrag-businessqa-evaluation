In this article, we argue that this line of inquiry contains a number of theoretical conclusions that have hitherto been overlooked or ignored by many organizational scholars.\n\nThis article presents a meta-analytic review of primary quantitative studies of the CSPâ€“CFP relationship. Meta-analysis has proven to be a useful technique in many substantive areas where multiple individual studies have yielded inconclusive or conflicting results (for example, Damanpour 1991; Datta et al. 1992; Gooding and Wagner 1985; Schwenk 1989; see also Hedges 1987; Hunt 1997; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001; and Schmidt 1992 for broader reviews of meta-analysis). By statistically aggregating results across individual studies and correcting for statistical artefacts such as sampling error and measurement error, psychometric meta-analysis allows for much greater precision than other forms of research reviews. Ironically, those researchers that question the meaningfulness of the CSPâ€“CFP research stream the most (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001) have integrated the empirical evidence with the so-called â€˜vote-countingâ€™ technique, which, for a variety of reasons, has been shown to be invalid by many statistical experts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Rosenthal 1995; Schmidt 1992). When, in â€˜vote countingâ€™, studies are simply coded as showing significantly positive, negative, or statistically non-significant results, conclusions are likely to be false (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In contrast, psychometric meta-analysis quantifies the impact of theoretical and methodological deficiencies in a given line of inquiry and is, therefore, at present, the most sophisticated research-integration technique.\n\nThe specific objectives of this meta-analysis are to: (1) provide a statistical integration of the accumulated research on the relationship between CSP and CFP.\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nCFP; (2) assess the relative predictive validity of instrumental stakeholder theory in the context of the CSPâ€“CFP relationship; and (3) examine several moderators, such as operationalization of CSP and CFP (that is, measurement strategies) and timing of CSP and CFP measurement. In so doing, it builds on earlier research by: (a) including market (stock) return measures in addition to accounting returns; (b) including CSP measures other than social-responsibility audits performed by Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc.; (c) responding to Waddock and Gravesâ€™ (1997: 315) call for research on the temporal consistency of results, independent of the time lag chosen between CSP and CFP measures; and (d) integrating empirical results across diverse study contexts and enabling us to look for theoretical moderators and statistical artefacts that might explain the highly variable results across previous studies.\n\n# Theory and Hypotheses\n\n# Overall CSPâ€“CFP Relationship\n\nInstrumental stakeholder theory (for example, Clarkson 1995; Cornell and Shapiro 1987; Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Mitchell et al. 1997 (the classification of these studies as exemplifying â€˜instrumental stakeholder theoryâ€™ was made ex post)) suggests a positive relationship between CSP and CFP. According to this theory, the satisfaction of various stakeholder groups is instrumental for organizational financial performance (Donaldson and Preston 1995; Jones 1995). Stakeholder-agency theory argues that the implicit and explicit negotiation and contracting processes entailed by reciprocal, bilateral stakeholderâ€“management relationships serve as monitoring and enforcement mechanisms that prevent managers from diverting attention from broad organizational financial goals (Hill and Jones 1992; Jones 1995). Furthermore, by addressing and balancing the claims of multiple stakeholders (Freeman and Evan 1990), managers can increase the efficiency of their organizationâ€™s adaptation to external demands.\n\nAdditionally, according to a firm-as-contract analysis (Freeman and Evan 1990), high corporate performance results not only from the separate satisfaction of bilateral relationships (Hill and Jones 1992), but also from the simultaneous coordination and prioritization of multilateral stakeholder interests. These strategic and tactical steps may be necessary to reduce the likelihood of the organizationâ€™s becoming stuck in a high-density network. High network density can reduce CFP in a number of ways (Rowley 1997). For example, in a high-density network, firms may become stuck in the role of compromiser or subordinate, depending on the degree of the firmâ€™s network centrality (Rowley 1997). Either of these roles may lead to further consumption of valuable firm resources such as time, labour, and capital. Conversely, high CSP bolsters a companyâ€™s competitive advantage by weighing and addressing the claims of various constituents in a fair, rational manner. This perspective, which is primarily derived from instrumental.\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n# 24(3)\n\nstakeholder theory (Jones 1995), has also been identified as the â€˜good management theoryâ€™ (Waddock and Graves 1997). Therefore, we predict that:\n\n# H1:\n\nCorporate social performance and financial performance are generally positively related across a wide variety of industry and study contexts.\n\n# Temporal Sequence\n\nLike the â€˜good management theoryâ€™, slack resources theory also proposes a positive association between CSP and CFP. However, it proposes a different temporal ordering â€” namely, that prior CFP is directly associated with subsequent CSP. Prior high levels of CFP may provide the slack resources necessary to engage in corporate social responsibility and responsiveness (Ullmann 1985; Waddock and Graves 1997). Because CSP often\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
