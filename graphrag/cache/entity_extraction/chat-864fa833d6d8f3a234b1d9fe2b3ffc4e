Paris Agreement and stock returns: difference-in-differences estimation.\n\nThe dependent variable is RET. Our treatment sample is the subset of firms in the largest quartile of the distribution of firms sorted by the size of their carbon emission as of the end of 2014. We match these firms with a control group of firms with similar characteristics identified by the nearest neighbor method. The matching characteristics we use are the same as those in our return regressions. TREAT is a generic indicator variable taking the value one for firms in the treatment sample and zero for firms in the control sample, and AFTER is an indicator variable equal to zero for the period 2015/05-2015/11 and equal to one for the period 2015/12-2016/05. We estimate this model separately for each scope and emission measure. In the regressions, the sorts correspond to each scope measure which then separately identify each individual treatment variable. We also include firm and year-month fixed effects in the regression. All variables are defined in Table 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the firm and year/month level. All regressions for columns 4-6 include industry-fixed effects. We report the results for the natural logarithm of contemporaneous total emissions in Panel A; the results for the growth rate in firm emissions in Panel B; and the results for emission intensity in Panel C. ***1% significance; **5% significance; *10% significance.\n\n|Variables|(1)|(2)|(3)|(4)|(5)|(6)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Panel A: Total emissions|TREAT1*AFTER|10.615***| |10.705***| | |\n| |(1.175)| | |(1.200)| | |\n| |TREAT2*AFTER| |-1.783| |-1.681| |\n| | |(5.861)| | |(5.821)| |\n| |TREAT3*AFTER| | |-8.917| |-8.782|\n| | | |(6.081)| |(6.127)| |\n|Controls|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Firm F.E.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Year/month F.E.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Industry F.E.|No|No|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Observations|5,452|6,604|6,604|5,452|6,604|6,324|\n\n|Variables|(1)|(2)|(3)|(4)|(5)|(6)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Panel B: Growth rate in total emissions|TREAT1*AFTER|0.438| |4.425| | |\n| |(4.426)| | |(3.373)| | |\n| |TREAT2*AFTER| |-3.712| |0.361| |\n| | |(3.541)| | |(2.592)| |\n| |TREAT3*AFTER| | |0.396| |3.671|\n| | | |(4.338)| |(3.927)| |\n|Controls|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Firm F.E.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Year/month F.E.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Industry F.E.|No|No|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Observations|5,764|5,706|5,901|5,764|5,706|5,901|\n\n# Panel C: Emission intensity\n\n|TREAT1*AFTER|2.825|2.855|\n|---|---|---|\n| |(5.876)|(5.994)|\n|TREAT2*AFTER|-0.016|0.021|\n| |(5.344)|(5.417)|\n|\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
