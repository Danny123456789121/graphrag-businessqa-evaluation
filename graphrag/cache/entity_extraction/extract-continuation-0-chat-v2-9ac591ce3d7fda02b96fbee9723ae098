It is plotted in Figure 4. Clearly it is dominated by science, climate change and environmental journals. Though a few economics journals (for example, American Economic Review, Ecological Economics) are shown to affect these researches, it is obvious that finance journals are hardly involved. Citation analysis for cited journals also indicates how the relevant literature network is developed. Once again, although this area bears the name of green finance, its current studies are rarely based on main stream finance journals. It also indicates a clear need to introduce techniques and models in main stream finance research to study green finance issues.\n\n(Insert Figure 4 here)\n\n# 4. Conclusion\n\nThis paper utilizes a simple bibliometric approach to analyze the current status and trend of development of academic research on the subject of green finance. Through ranking analysis and visualized illustration on a number of key factors of a sample of 381 relevant publications, we find important information that can help us form an accurate picture of this subject matter. Based on keywords analysis of the literature, green finance needs to be considered an interdisciplinary research.\n\nPage 11 of 20\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\ntopic that encompasses and deals with policies, investment and governance on financing and investment in climate adaption. As the authors’ country of origin analysis reveals, green finance researches are currently dominated by scholars from developed economies. Papers in this area are mainly published by policy journals or journals focusing on environmental/climate changes, while scarcely seen in mainstream economics or finance journals.\n\nGreen finance has shown its great importance and fast growing relevance. With increasing interests in recent literature but a lack of attention from mainstream economics and finance journals, it has created a gap that gives opportunities to researchers in at least three directions for future developments. First, given that green finance is essentially a matter of finance, there is urgent need to study green finance issues from finance perspectives and using techniques from finance. Topics such as green bonds, green risk management and green governance should be of interests in mainstream finance journals. Second, more studies on green finance issues from developing countries’ perspectives would be useful to regulators and policy makers to align different policy goals and develop well-defined policy objectives. With clear information advantages, scholars from developing countries will be given more chances, and more international collaboration between developing and developed countries are expected. Third, it is worth mentioning that a remarkable difference between green finance and standard finance topics is that the former is essentially policy driven. New issues in this field are thus likely to emerge with the rapidly changing international economic and political environments. Moreover, to our best knowledge, a comprehensive review of relevant literature is still not available. It is definitely worth to explore and make comparison to the results of our bibliometric analysis.\n\n# References\n\nPage 12 of 20\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nBredin, D., Hyde, S., Muckley, C., 2014.
