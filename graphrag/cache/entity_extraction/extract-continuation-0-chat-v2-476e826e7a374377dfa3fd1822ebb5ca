The time-series regressions for the returns of these portfolios are reported at the bottom of Panel B. The average loading on the temperature factor for small stocks is -16.89 (t = -10.38), while for large stocks it is -2.80 (t = -3.17). The sensitivity difference between small and big stocks is -14.09 with a HAC-robust t-statistic of -6.51. The average loading on the temperature factor for value stocks is -21.40 (t = -29.29), while that for growth stocks is 1.64 (t = 1.40). The sensitivity difference between value and growth stocks is -23.04 with a HAC-robust t-statistic of -18.06. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is also strongly supported for the 25 size and BM portfolios.\n\nThe economy-wide average impact on the cost of equity capital is obtained by multiplying the temperature shock risk premium by the weighted average loading. We use the market value weights and loadings of the 55 industry- and size-value sorted portfolios. The weight is obtained by dividing the market value of each portfolio by the sum of the market values of the 55 portfolios. The loadings on the alternative versions of TSF are obtained as in Table 4 from the time-series regressions of portfolio returns on the appropriate factors for each model. The weighted averages of the loadings are multiplied by the risk premium (γ from Table 2 for the primary specification CAPM+TSF model, and Table 3 for the alternative TSF specifications) to find the average impact measure. Note that the step of multiplying the risk...\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\npremium by the loadings is necessary because there is nothing in our approach that requires loadings to sum to one (as for market returns) or to zero (as for some factor mimicking portfolios).11\n\nPanel A of Table 5 shows the total value-weighted impact. Using the CAPM plus TSF risk model the impact (the risk premium times the average temperature shock loading) is economically significant and has the same order of magnitude for each of the alternative TSF specifications. Numerically, the weighted average annual increase in the cost of equity capital from temperature shocks is 0.22 percent in the Primary specification, 0.23 percent for ALT1, 0.26 percent for ALT2, and 0.18 percent for ALT3.\n\nTo discover if Hypothesis 3 can be confirmed, we repeat the above exercise with rolling samples to find whether the impact of temperature shocks has increased from an early part of the test period to a later part. The risk premium at each time is estimated with 30 years of data to obtain meaningful estimates. As our earliest observation for the term premium is 1953 the test period starts in 1983. We update estimates monthly by dropping the earliest observation and adding the latest observation. Panel B of Table 5 shows the average impact based on the rolling estimates over two evenly divided sub-periods: 1983-1998 and 1999-2014. To properly evaluate the significance of the impact difference in the two subsample periods we use the approach of Cooper, Gutierrez, and Hameed (2004) which provides appropriate standard errors.\n\nIn the primary specification the average temperature shock impact in period 1983-1998 is a significantly positive 0.11 percent. The impact in the more recent period 1999-2014 is also significantly positive, but three times as large at 0.33 percent. The difference is clearly\n\n11 The value-weighted average loadings present a proper market average (for the US stock market). Whereas, roughly, each firm is represented twice (once in the industries and once in the value-size sorted portfolios) the computation requires the value weights of the 55 portfolios to sum to one so that each firm’s market value is accurately reflected.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nsignificantly positive. The results for the three alternative specifications are qualitatively identical, also showing a significant impact in both periods with a substantially larger impact in the second period.\n\nThe significant difference for the two intervals nominally confirms Hypothesis 3. To obtain more information about the path of the temperature shock impact over time, we present the specific time paths of the impact in Figure 2. These are quite consistent for the various specifications. A closer look at the time path of the impacts over time illustrates that the issues are not as simple as hypothesized. The evidence further confirms that temperature variation matters for asset pricing and that its impact is significantly positive and, until recently, has been growing over time as is consistent with Hypotheses 1 and 3. However, the impact estimate appears to decrease after 2004, which is not consistent with Hypothesis 3.\n\nThere are plausible explanations for the unexpected decrease in the impact estimate after 2004 that are consistent with the perspective of climate change risk. In particular:\n\n1. The risk premium on the temperature shock factor may have declined because of reduced temperature risk. Indeed, as Panel E of Figure 2 shows, the standard deviation of temperature (30-year moving average of U.S. annual temperatures) displays a similar pattern as the time series of impact estimates in Panels A-D, and has started to decline after 2004.\n2.
