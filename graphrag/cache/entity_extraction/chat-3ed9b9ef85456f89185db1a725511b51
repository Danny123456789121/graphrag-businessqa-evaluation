Conclusions\n\nThis study’s goal is to propose a corporate sustainability framework that is more resilient than prior models and, to rank relevant criteria to the degree that could help develop a corporate sustainability model. This study is grounded in previous studies and showed the interconnected relations of sustainability and the relevance of considering stakeholders [107]. In meeting the objectives of this study we have multiple contributions to the field of sustainable business practices; (1) to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria as part of a new integrated framework; (2) provide a methodology to help organize and understand a dynamic context for sustainable business practices; (3) extend our understanding of social sustainability by also exploring and finding new insights regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe were able to identify several sustainability attributes from literature, which allowed for an analysis of prior studies and the identification of sustainability attributes, which is also supported by experts’ assessments. As a result, 45 sustainability sub-criteria were developed and ranked according to the main nine categories of Corporate Governance, Transparency and Communication, Product Responsibility, Environment, Social, Economics, Natural Environment and Climate Change, Energy Consumption and Saving and, for the very first time, we have included Pandemic as an important criterion in the development of corporate sustainability model. These criteria help to develop a new integrative framework of social sustainability. Additional contributions of this study include the application of a Fuzzy Delphi and FAHP methodology, and the computation of nine main criteria and 45 sub-criteria. These criteria provide a more dynamic assessment of the interrelated social dimensions that have in the past been looked at individually and as environmental impacts of firms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new insights include the Pandemic, along with Economic and Corporate Governance are top-ranked criteria to focus on improving corporate sustainability practices. Whereas, emergency response plan, social distance and modification in the number of working hours, commitment to climate changes, and JIT and lean delivery emerged in the top-ranked sub-criteria.\n\nThe outcomes of our work lead us to call for more action from decision-makers and policymakers as sustainability provides an integration opportunity with dynamic social benefits. Moreover, scholars also can consider relevant criteria from literature, and building on this research when combining insights from experts and develop a new, more integrated, corporate sustainability model. The research in this study also contributes to developing theory with contemporary approaches for decision-making analysis to show corporate sustainability theory can and should include more social sustainability practices. When doing so, we hope the efforts of both researchers and practitioners will be able to find more dynamic relationships between practices, firm performance, and resiliency to overcome future pandemics. Our results also provide insights to scholars wanting to further develop theories considering Multiple Management Standards (MMSs), the Stakeholder Theory [108], Integrated Management [109], Integrated Management Systems (IMS), and possibilities for a new theory such as a social sustainability-based view (SBV) of the firm.\n\nThe methods used in this study support decision-making in a powerful and relatively simple way. This useful perspective addresses decision-makers and researchers dealing with resource allocation or project prioritization. These methods may be applied toward further replications by future studies. The methods described in this study help in measuring strategic goals as a set of scored criteria for determining project selection. Multi-criterion decision-making methodologies have proven to be useful in the application for manufacturing sectors. We can foresee the need for more work with these types of firms using the application of MCDA in complex interdisciplinary and social sustainability problems. We recommend future studies include developing FAHP techniques in combination with other analysis opportunities in an integrated system, supply chains, cities, and even entire countries aiming to tackle grand challenges, for example, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nFinally, this research is the first of its kind considering the development of an integrated social sustainability model with social sustainability criteria that include the pandemic and COVID-19. Outcomes of this study can help organizations to consider the most suitable programs and systems for advancing corporate sustainability while also considering stakeholders and social sustainability. As managerial implications, we see sustainable development enabling companies to integrate audits, engage personnel, and optimizing companies’ processes and resource allocation. Social sustainability is dynamic, not easily understood, and can be disruptive if not taken into account as part of corporate social sustainability at every level of the firm.\n\nThis study presents some limitations. We address the limitation related to the developed models based on experts’ assessments. By choosing this approach, it is assumed that bias will always occur in the process. Future applications of this approach may include a diversified set of experts and managers from companies that may be more impacted by systems implementations. Another limitation is concerning data availability. Managers involved in an MCDA process may have limited access to data concerning all criteria or even the entire multinational company as a consequence of a lack of integrated information. Moreover, these issues can be solved by careful consideration of practitioners involved in the decision-making process when realizing that inputs are qualitative, in nature, and the time needed for options assessments. Then, the criteria and outcomes should be revisited when assessing corporate sustainability performance over time.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nconceptualization, M.I.; methodology,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
