The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment the impact of AI overall, generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and transforming the nature of work.\n\nBut the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must act—and quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to address both the opportunities and the risks. Risks have already surfaced, including concerns about the content that generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual property due to “plagiarism” in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the answers that LLMs produce when questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will the content generative AI creates be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, producing content that reflects harmful stereotypes?\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nThere are economic challenges too: the scale and the scope of the workforce transitions described in this report are considerable. In the midpoint adoption scenario, about a quarter to a third of work activities could change in the coming decade. The task before us is to manage the potential positives and negatives of the technology simultaneously (for more about the potential risks of generative AI, see Box 5). Here are some of the critical questions we will need to address while balancing our enthusiasm for the potential benefits of the technology with the new challenges it can introduce.\n\n# Box 5\n\n# Using generative AI responsibly\n\nGenerative AI poses a variety of risks. Stakeholders will want to address these risks from the start.\n\n- Fairness: Models may generate algorithmic bias due to imperfect training data or decisions made by the engineers developing the models.\n- Intellectual property (IP): Training data and model outputs can generate significant IP risks, including infringing on copyrighted, trademarked, patented, or otherwise legally protected materials. Even when using a provider’s generative AI tool, organizations will need to understand what data went into training and how it’s used in tool outputs.\n- Privacy: Privacy concerns could arise if users input information that later ends up in model outputs in a form that makes individuals identifiable. Generative AI could also be used to create and disseminate malicious content such as disinformation, deepfakes, and hate speech.\n- Security: Generative AI may be used by bad actors to accelerate the sophistication and speed of cyberattacks. It also can be manipulated to provide malicious outputs. For example, through a technique called prompt injection, a third party gives a model new instructions that trick the model into delivering an output unintended by the model producer and end user.\n- Reliability: Models can produce different answers to the same prompts, impeding the user’s ability to assess the accuracy and reliability of outputs.\n- Organizational impact: Generative AI may significantly affect the workforce, and the impact on specific groups and local communities could be disproportionately negative.\n- Social and environmental impact: The development and training of foundation models may lead to detrimental social and environmental consequences, including an increase in carbon emissions (for example, training one large language model can emit about 315 tons of carbon dioxide).\n\n1 Ananya Ganesh, Andrew McCallum, and Emma Strubell, “Energy and policy considerations for deep learning in NLP,” Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, June 5, 2019.\n\n# Companies and business leaders\n\nHow can companies move quickly to capture the potential value at stake highlighted in this report, while managing the risks that generative AI presents?\n\nHow will the mix of occupations and skills needed across a company’s workforce be transformed by generative AI and other artificial intelligence over the coming years? How will a company enable these transitions in its hiring plans, retraining programs, and other aspects of human resources?\n\nDo companies have a role to play in ensuring the technology is not deployed in “negative use cases” that could harm society?\n\nHow can businesses transparently share their experiences with scaling the use of generative AI within and across industries—and also with governments and society?\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier 49\n\n# Policy makers\n\nWhat will the future of work look like at the level of an economy in terms of occupations and skills? What does this mean for workforce planning?\n\nHow can workers be supported as their activities shift over time? What retraining programs can be put in place? What incentives are needed to support private companies as they invest in human capital? Are there earn-while-you-learn programs such as apprenticeships that could enable people to retrain while continuing to support themselves and their families?\n\nWhat steps can policy makers take to prevent generative AI from being used in ways that harm society or vulnerable populations?\n\nCan new policies be developed and existing policies amended to ensure human-centric AI development and deployment that includes human oversight and diverse perspectives and accounts for societal values?\n\n# Individuals as workers, consumers, and citizens\n\nHow concerned should individuals be about the advent of generative AI? While companies can assess how the technology will affect their bottom lines, where can citizens turn for accurate, unbiased information about how it will affect their lives and livelihoods?\n\nHow can individuals as workers and consumers balance the conveniences generative AI delivers with its impact in their workplaces?\n\nCan citizens have a voice in the decisions that will shape the deployment and integration of generative AI into the fabric of their lives?\n\nTechnological innovation can inspire equal parts awe and concern. When that innovation seems to materialize fully formed and becomes widespread seemingly overnight, both responses can be amplified. The arrival of generative AI in the fall of 2022 was the most recent example of this phenomenon, due to its unexpectedly rapid adoption as well as the ensuing scramble among companies and consumers to deploy, integrate, and play with it.\n\nAll of us are\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence technologies that can generate text, images, and other content based on input data, significantly impacting various industries and the nature of work.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANANYA GANESH<|>PERSON<|>Ananya Ganesh is a researcher who co-authored a paper on energy and policy considerations for deep learning in natural language processing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW MCCALLUM<|>PERSON<|>Andrew McCallum is a researcher who co-authored a paper on energy and policy considerations for deep learning in natural language processing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMMA STRUBELL<|>PERSON<|>Emma Strubell is a researcher who co-authored a paper on energy and policy considerations for deep learning in natural language processing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association for Computational Linguistics is a professional organization that promotes research and development in the field of computational linguistics and natural language processing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPANIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Companies are organizations that may leverage generative AI to enhance productivity and manage associated risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICY MAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Policy makers are individuals or groups responsible for creating regulations and guidelines that govern the use of technologies like generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIVIDUALS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals refer to workers, consumers, and citizens who are affected by the deployment of generative AI in their lives and workplaces.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANANYA GANESH<|>ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS<|>Ananya Ganesh is a researcher associated with the Association for Computational Linguistics through her work on deep learning in NLP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW MCCALLUM<|>ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS<|>Andrew McCallum is a researcher associated with the Association for Computational Linguistics through his work on deep learning in NLP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMMA STRUBELL<|>ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS<|>Emma Strubell is a researcher associated with the Association for Computational Linguistics through her work on deep learning in NLP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPANIES<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Companies are leveraging generative AI to enhance productivity and manage associated risks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLICY MAKERS<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Policy makers are responsible for creating regulations that govern the use of generative AI technologies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIVIDUALS<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Individuals are affected by the deployment of generative AI in their workplaces and daily lives<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
