All corporate activities have an influence on society and the natural environment and, therefore, may (or may not) contribute to sustainable development.\n\nHow can companies create societal value while contributing to sustainable development? To answer this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the\n\n1 Societal value refers to both society and nature.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nimpacts of business on societies and the natural environment. These impacts then need to be integrated into the content dimension of strategy. One must clarify how sustainable strategic management can reduce negative social and environmental impacts and contribute to improving social and environmental outcomes.\n\nA company is a system that transforms resources (i.e., inputs) into saleable products and services as well as into unwanted by-products, waste and emissions (Hinterhuber, 2004). In order to do so, the company must deliver appropriate returns to those who provide the company with resources (see Figure 1). Management coordinates internal activities as well as its relationships with customers, shareholders, suppliers, partner companies, authorities, society and the stakeholders in general.\n\nShareholders and financial community\n\ncompany\n\nSuppliers\n\nDevelopment; Production, Sales\n\nEmployees\n\nTechnoloqv and infrastructure\n\nMaterials and energy\n\nMANUS CRIP Tdevices\n\nPartner companies\n\nSociety\n\nResource inputs\n\nAppropriate returns\n\nFigure 1: A company as a system for transforming resources (Hinterhuber, 2004)\n\nSustainability issues can be divided into economic (see Table 1), environmental (see Table 2) and social issues (see Table 3), and are related to all input and output flows. With regard to management methods and instruments, companies can implement and run environmental (e.g., ISO 14001; EMAS) or social (e.g., SA 8000) management systems, integrated management systems (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005; Jørgensen et al., 2006), or use specific management instruments to address environmental or social issues (such as LCA or social LCA, sustainability balanced scorecards (Figge et al., 2002), or environmental cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000)).\n\nEconomic sustainability embraces several general aspects of an organization that need to be respected, in addition to environmental and social aspects, in order to maintain the competitiveness of the company (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Financial stability and liquidity, profitability and financial benefits that are the result of sustainability activities are primary elements making up the economic dimension (Labuschagne et al., 2005). Therefore, issues such as\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nInnovation and technology management, collaboration, knowledge management, organizational processes and purchase or sustainability reporting are important economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010).\n\n|Economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010)|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Innovation and Technology|Effort made in sustainability-related R&D to reduce the environmental impacts of new products and business activities. Use of BAT (Best Available Techniques) and integrated environmental technologies, concentrating on cleaner production and zero emission technologies.|\n|Collaboration|Good cooperation and active collaboration with various partners (e.g., suppliers, R&D institutions, universities). Working in shared programs and networks on the development of innovative products and technologies. Exchange of information and knowledge.|\n|Knowledge Management|Activities and approaches that keep knowledge related to sustainability in the organization. Methods to plan, develop, organize, maintain, transfer, apply and measure specific knowledge and improve the organizational knowledge base.|\n|Processes|Clear processes and roles are defined so that business activities are efficiently conducted, and every employee knows what the organization expects from him or her (also with respect to sustainability). Adaptations of process management to achieve sustainability necessitate the systematic implementation of corporate sustainability. Integration of sustainability into daily business life.|\n|Purchase|Consideration of issues related to sustainability in purchasing. Awareness and consideration of issues related to sustainability in the organization, as well as throughout the supply chain. Relationships with suppliers, with a focus also placed on sustainability.|\n|Sustainability Reporting|Inclusion of issues related to sustainability in company reports, either in individual sustainability reports or integrated in corporate reports.|\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Table 2: Environmental issues of business activities (based on Baumgartner, 2010; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010)\n\n|Input|• renewable resources (materials, energy) including recycling flows| |\n|---|---|---|\n|• fossil-fuel based and non-renewable resources (materials, energy) including recycling flows| | |\n| | |• land use|\n| | |• biodiversity|\n| |• use of environmentally-friendly technologies (for example, cleaner production)| |\n|Throughput creation production and service|• environmentally-oriented product and service design| |\n|• efficient use of the production facilities and infrastructure| | |\n| | |• environmental impacts of transport|\n| | |• air, water and soil emissions|\n| | |• waste and hazardous waste|\n|Output|products, co-products, waste and emissions| |\n| | |• impacts on biodiversity|\n|• product-related environmental impacts determined by the product design (usage and disposal phase)| | |\n|Value chain|upstream| |\n| | |• environmental impacts of suppliers|\n| |downstream| |\n| |• environmental impacts of product user behavior| |\n\nThese sustainability issues provide the basis for the definition of a corporate sustainability strategy (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Baumgartner, 2014). The strategies with an external focus (extroverted and visionary sustainability strategy) are likely to have a particularly strong societal impact.
