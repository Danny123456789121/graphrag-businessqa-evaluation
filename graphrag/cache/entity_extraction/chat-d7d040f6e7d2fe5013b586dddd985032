Commitment to climate change (NEC1) is presented as the highest score within sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. The tree planting program (NEC3) is located in the second position with a 0.5241 score. The responsibility and climate change systems (NEC2) and Issues concerning climate change (NEC4) come in at the third and fourth positions within the category with scores of 0.48521 and 0.3581, respectively. A responsibility attributed to businesses regarding environmental crisis mitigation is crucial, due to these organizations.\n\nMonitoring effective systems. Moreover, climate change is usually considered an important threat in society and nature, more critical than biodiversity loss. Regarding the company’s sustainability performance, the tree planting program (NEC3) is located in the second position with a 0.5241 score. The responsibility and climate change systems (NEC2) and Issues concerning climate change (NEC4) come in at the third and fourth positions within the category with scores of 0.48521 and 0.3581, respectively. A responsibility attributed to businesses regarding environmental crisis mitigation is crucial, due to these organizations possessing greater experience than any other group in society when dealing with such kind of problems. The organization should develop an environment towards a climate-friendly perspective, since climate changes are affecting societies and will affect, as a consequence, companies’ revenues. In this scenario, tougher legislation and binding treaties are needed [106].\n\n|Issues concerning climate change - NEC4|0.3581|\n|---|---|\n|Responsibility and climate change systems - NEC2|0.48521|\n|Tree plantation Program - NEC3|0.5241|\n|Commitment to climate changes - NEC1|0.5585|\n\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 Weight\n\nFigure 13. Natural Environment and Climate Change Sub-criteria.\n\nPandemic: Under the Pandemic (PAN) category, results in Figure 14 show the sub-attributes in the following order of importance: PAN1>PAN4>PAN2>PAN3. An emergency response plan (PAN1) obtained the highest weight 0.7646. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, whose major consequences are expected to be revealed in the long-term, results provided a deeper analysis of business risks, which can help organizations to plan accordingly. The organizations should incorporate an emergency plan in order to respond to the pandemic (PAN1), which is considered a community-led initiative based on different scenarios for testing the resilience and the plans addressing the several impacts of the crisis.\n\nFollowing this, the highest sub-criteria identified is the modification in the number of working hours and social distancing (PAN4) with a weight of 0.6752. Environmental dimensions are the focus of companies and, for this research, organizations are taking several actions to fight the coronavirus outbreak, especially with social distancing and the modification in employee working hours. Organizations should also dedicate focus on their supply chains and on social innovations issues that may result from this pandemic. Results also showed that the JIT as well as lean delivery (PAN2) obtained 0.6241 weight and are in the third position within this category. The pandemic caused by the coronavirus emphasized vulnerabilities related to the overreliance of JIT and lean delivery systems. Additionally, there is a concern about whether JIT systems can contribute to the overall efficiency of resources and waste, in order to transform them into environmentally sound [85].\n\nThe growing smarter logistics systems are witnessed by organizations, specifically the consideration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies applications, and reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products. Some possible applications of IoT and reverse logistics are addressed. In the first example, monitoring where electronics and appliances and their components are may ease their retrieval and allocation at local levels. As a second example, companies may benefit by using intermediary storage/depots instead of using extensive transportation of processed goods, also favoring reverse logistics. The fourth sub-criteria under the COVID-19 pandemic category, commitment to employee safety (PAN3), has a weight of 0.5354.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Commitment to employee safety-PAN2\n\n0.5354\n\n# Just-in-time (JIT) and lean delivery-PAN3\n\n6241\n\n# Modification in the number of working hours-PAN4\n\n0.6752\n\n# Emergency response plan-PANI\n\n0.7646\n\n# Figure 14.

Investing in renewable energy (ECS2) holds the first position within the Energy Consumption and Saving category with the highest score (0.5354). Moreover, initiatives to reduce energy consumption (ECS1) is located at the second position with a score of 0.4646.
