This will in turn reduce the spurious difference between SRI and control portfolios.\n\n# 4. Data\n\nSince representativeness is crucial in meta-analysis, we try to collect as many papers as possible including unpublished ones to avoid publication bias. We search databases such as EBSCO, JSTOR, Science Direct, Springer Link, Wiley-Blackwell, and SSRN, and utilize web search engines like Google Scholar. We also attempt to collect papers from many academic journals, as shown in Table A2 of the Appendix.\n\nA detailed description of our data collection process is shown in Table A1 and a flowchart in the Appendix. We first compose keywords that are related to SRI as extensively as possible. By using the phrase “socially responsible investment,” we obtain 1,555 articles that include at least one word in the phrase. Then, we check all articles one by one to sort out those that have the potential to be included in our final list of papers. By using the next phrase, “socially responsible investing,” we have 1,226 results. Since the two phrases are quite similar, most observations are duplicates of the first search and we obtain only two additional articles that have the potential to be included in the final sample. The process continues with new phrases until we use “ethical investing,” as shown in Table A1 of the Appendix. Since too many duplicates appear by that time, we begin to use the exact phrase “social investing” to narrow down the search results. We download 151 papers from this keyword search. Another important data collection process is to scrutinize the reference section of selected papers, especially summary or synthesis papers (Renneboog et al., 2008b; Chegut et al., 2011; Capelle-Blancard and Monjon, 2014).\n\nAfter potential papers are collected, we read them more carefully to decide which papers are to be included in the final sample. Since the quality of data is crucial for an accurate assessment of SRI effects, we pay very careful attention to the data compilation process. The following explains some of the steps we have taken to preserve data integrity. Further details are in the Appendix.\n\n1. We drop qualitative analyses.\n2. If there are several versions of the same paper, we use the most recent paper to avoid overrepresentation bias. For example, Derwall et al. (2004) is a working paper version of Derwall et al. (2005), and we use the latter.\n3. We include studies with matching firms or studies without matching firms but with market indices as benchmarks of SRI performance.\n4. We include all relevant analyses based on important dimensions such as investment universe, sub-periods, conditional versus unconditional regression, matching versus non-matching, value weighted versus equal weighted, risk-adjusted versus risk-unadjusted, one-factor model versus multi-factor model, etc.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nAfter this screening process, we obtain 51 papers, 18 from the keyword search and 33 from reference checking, which study the impact of SRI on financial performance in the US. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) assert that the influence of SRI varies significantly with a difference in cultural background. Focusing on the US market helps us sharpen the interpretation of results without the need to consider cultural differences. Figure S1 shows the flowchart of the selection process. The publication dates of the final sample run from 1978 to 2016.\n\nFrom the selected papers, we extract 205 experiments to calculate ESs. In other words, our number of observations is the number of experiments, not papers, since each paper reports multiple analyses. For example, if a paper reports two tables of comparison between SRI and conventional funds, with one based on raw return and the other based on Jensen’s alpha, we end up having two observations. Since a paper often reports results based on various subsamples, different experiments of the same paper can have different values for the number of firms, sample period, and all other relevant variables. We report detailed information including ESs on all 205 experiments in Table A2 of the Appendix.\n\n# 5. Results\n\n# 5.1. Results on Effect Sizes\n\nTable 3 shows the descriptive statistics of ESs calculated from 205 comparisons. The median and mean ESs are 0.015 and 0.016 that can be interpreted as having very small ES according to Table 1. This result is consistent with many existing papers (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Humphrey et al., 2016).
