The reliability coefficient rpp is 1-ProVar, which is calculated as the ratio of b2/S2p σp where b2 σp is the estimate of the actual (non-artifactual) variance across the m-meta-analyses of the population mean-disattenuated correlations. This is the variance that remains after the variance for the second-order sampling error has been subtracted from the variance of mean-disattenuated correlations across the m-meta-analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013).\n\nAdjustments for second-order sampling error are useful to reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and therefore produce more accurate estimations of the true mean effect size and (non-artifactual) variance in first-order meta-analyses. These figures are displayed in columns 6–13 of Table 4.\n\n# Moderating Factors\n\nFor determining potential moderating factors, the data were split into two or, if necessary, into multiple subgroups. We calculated z-values to identify whether effect size differences among groups are significant. For assessing the potential time dependence of the CSP-CFP relation, we analyzed the effect sizes in dependence of the meta-study publication year and the average publication year of the primary study in each meta-analysis. To rule out a distortion.\n\n3The index (1) for n and other statistics symbolizes first-order level (extracted effects of primary studies from meta-analyses) in comparison to figures without this index which are second-order level.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

The influence of the publishing source was compared for SIM journals versus General Management (GM) journals based on Orlitzky’s (2011) categorization. Since definitions regarding what can be considered as a SIM or GM journal differ (AoM SIM Division, 2012), all publishing journals of the 25 meta-analyses were classified according to the Thomson Reuters’ JCR classification standard. The SSCI subject categories present in our sample (business, environmental studies, ethics, management, political science, and applied psychology) were used to alternatively differentiate the sample of meta-analyses. If a journal was listed in more than one SSCI category, the one where it ranks highest was selected. Furthermore, the JCR 5-Year Journal Impact Factors (2014), the annual citation frequency of the meta-analyses, and the deviation between working papers and published studies were evaluated.\n\nFinally, effect size dependence on methodological quality was evaluated. The methodology quality assessment builds on Aguinis et al. (2011) and transferred those parts of Aguinis et al.’s 21 parameters which could be expressed as dichotomous and qualitative. All parameters which were applied multiple times (e.g. range restrictions) are summarized to one overarching parameter. For each of the parameter identifiable in a meta-study, the meta-study received a score of 1 (present) or 0 (not present). The condensed set contained 11 parameters and therefore yielded a maximum methodological quality score of 11. The total scores for the set of 25 meta-analyses range between 2 and 9.\n\n# Addressing Publication Bias\n\nA general concern of any meta-analysis is that research yielding no significant results remains unpublished (e.g. Dickersin, 2005). Rosenthal (1979) labelled this potential limitation as the file drawer problem, with reference to the many files that remain with the investigator and are not published by journals. We addressed this potential drawback by calculating the Fail-Safe N (or file drawer) statistic, a display of the Funnel Plot, and the inclusion of unpublished literature. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level (Rosenthal, 1979). Rosenthal suggested a tolerance level of 5n+10 for Fail-Safe N to be considered unlikely. The statistic was calculated for all summary and sub-effects. For a visual investigation of publication bias we included as well a funnel plot (Light & Pillemer, 1984; Sutton, 2009). It scatters the study size of a meta-analysis against the effect size. In our case the funnel plot displays all m = 129 sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p (Figure 1). The effects are symmetrically distributed around the underlying true effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). As such, we can exclude biases in the data. Furthermore, we applied the Egger test for publication bias, which tests for asymmetry of the funnel plot (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997). Moreover, we separated attenuated and disattenuated effects from unpublished studies and subgroup the results against published studies (Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). The proportion of these working papers within the total results was notably high. They contributed 28 of the 129 sub-effects. All checks revealed that the results are very likely not be affected by publication bias (Figure 1; Table 5).\n\n# Robustness Checks\n\nThe empirical outcomes of this analysis can be considered as fairly robust for a number of reasons.
