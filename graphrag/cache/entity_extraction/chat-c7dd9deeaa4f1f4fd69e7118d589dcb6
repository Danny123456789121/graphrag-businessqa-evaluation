Example: Existence of an environmental management system.\n\nMeasures focusing on tangible results of a firm’s internal efforts and management processes regarding environmental issues (i.e., directly quantifiable measures) (Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Xie & Hayase, 2007). Example: Amount of pollutants released.\n\nMeasures capturing a firm’s environmental activities, which go beyond environmental regulations as well as measures of pollution prevention (Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Example: Pollution generation measures.\n\nMeasures capturing a firm’s environmental activities, which aim to meet the regulatory standards as well as measures of end-of-pipe pollution treatment (Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Example: Pollution treatment measures.\n\nMeasures of CFP referring to stock market indicators of a firm’s financial performance. Example: Tobin’s q.\n\nMeasures of CFP referring to accounting indicators of a firm’s financial performance. Example: ROA.\n\nIncorporation of a measure of firm size (e.g., total assets) as control variable.\n\nIncorporation of industry membership as a control variable or the use of single-industry samples.\n\nIncorporation of a measure of financial risk (e.g., debt-to-asset ratio) as a control variable or the use of risk-adjusted measures of CFP (e.g., risk-adjusted returns). Note that we coded both operationalizations of risk, accounting risk and market risk.\n\nIncorporation of a measure of R&D intensity (e.g., R&D expenditures) as control variable.\n\nIncorporation of a measure of advertising intensity (e.g., advertising expenditures) as control variable.\n\nIncorporation of a measure of capital intensity (e.g., assets-to-sales ratio) as a control variable.\n\nUse of fixed-effects panel data models and instrumental variable regressions (Sánchez-Ballesta & García-Meca, 2007; van Essen et al., in press).\n\nSingle industry samples versus cross-sectional samples.\n\nStudies published after the year 1997 versus studies published earlier.\n\n# Table 2\n\n# Results of the bivariate HOMA.\n\n|H|Relationships|k|N|r|95% CI|Q|QB|p|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Overall relationship between CEP and CFP|245|201,511|.102***|.085|.119|2959.662|.000|\n|1a|Process-based CEP and subsequent market-based CFP|27|25,350|.007|.037|.051| |.755|\n|1b|Process-based CEP and subsequent accounting-based CFP|23|16,970|.085**|.030|.147| |.001|\n| | | | | | |5.342*|.021| |\n|1c|Outcome-based CEP and subsequent market-based CFP|17|22,789|.096***|.048|.145| |.000|\n|1d|Outcome-based CEP and subsequent accounting-based CFP|20|16,606|.051*|.004|.097| |.033|\n| | | | | | |1.754|.185| |\n|2a|Process-based CEP and prior market-based CFP|4|1,503|.066|.102|.230| |.440|\n|2b|Process-based CEP and prior accounting-based CFP|12|5,716|.124*|.029|.217| |.010|\n| | | | | | |.350|.554| |\n|2c|Outcome-based CEP and prior market-based CFP|5|4,671|.080|.003|.162| |.060|\n|2d|Outcome-based CEP and prior accounting-based CFP|8|5,303|.026|.048|.099| |.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
