E, S, and G categories and their relation to CFP (vote-count studies sample), n = 644 net studies.\n\nWhen reviewing studies with various combinations of ESG criteria, 35.3% report positive (respectively 7.1% negative) findings. The downside bias primarily arises from a high proportion of portfolio-based studies in this section (39.1%). If all these studies were excluded, the positive (negative) rate stands at 51.7% (4.8%) which is nonetheless lower than pure E, S, and G approaches (Figure 6).\n\n# Sub-effects in regions\n\nSome studies have analyzed potential differences in the ESG–CFP relation across regions. Though findings are far from consistent, some hypothesized that the ESG–CFP relation across countries is particularly affected by a higher humane orientation (del Mar Miras-Rodríguez, Carrasco-Gallego, and Escobar-Pérez 2015). Others find that the ESG–CFP relationship for US assets is significantly higher compared to non-US assets (Allouche and Laroche 2005; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013). In contrast, a few researchers also discover significantly higher effects for studies conducted in the rest of the world (Albertini 2013; Golicic and Smith 2013).\n\nWe detect two main patterns in the data based on 843 gross studies with disclosed regional identifier that are netted for a final sample of 402 studies. First, developed markets excluding North America exhibit a smaller share of positive results. This contrast is most apparent between North America (42.7% positive) and developed Europe (26.1% positive). Developed Asia/Australia possess a positive share of 33.3%, though with the largest share of negatives as well at 14.3%. The total sample excluding North American stands at 27.8% positive share. A check of the underlying studies reveals a larger share of portfolio-based studies within the European and Asian/Australian sample that potentially biases the data. However, when omitting all portfolio studies for the developed market samples, the positive ratio for North America increases to 51.5%, and for Europe and Asia/Australia combined to 45.6%. This implies that the previous gap between the two samples shrinks considerably – from 14.9 to 5.9 percentage points.\n\nSecond, the Emerging Markets sample shows, with 65.4%, a considerable higher share of positive outcomes over developed markets. Excluding the proportion of portfolio studies, the ratio increases further to 70.8%. Based on 52 single studies in Emerging Markets solely focused on equity-linked studies, the spread to developed markets is considerable (Figure 7).\n\n# G. Friede et al.\n\n# ESG–CFP relation in various regions (vote-count studies sample), n = 402 net studies.\n\n|0%|10%|20%|30%|40%|50%|60%|70%|80%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|[ developed America]|7.1%|14.3%|26.1%|38.5%|33.3%|49.8%|51.5%|70.8%|\n|[ AUSINZ]|5.3%|8.0%|8.9%|7.7%|7.7%|6.2%|5.8%|65.4%|\n|[ developed Asia]|8.0%|8.9%|7.7%|7.7%|6.2%|5.8%|4.2%| |\n|[ developed Markets]| | | | | | | | |\n|[ Emerging Markets]| | | | | | | | |\n\n# ESG effect over time\n\nThe question has been raised of whether the ESG–CFP relation is stable over time (Grifﬁn and Mahon 1997; Borgers et al. 2013). Theoretically, the increasing amount of UN PRI signatories and, presuming an increasing ESG awareness within investment strategies, a decreasing ESG alpha (shrinking correlations over time) would be expected due to learning effects in capital markets.\n\n# ESG–CFP correlation factors in primary studies in dependency of study publishing dates (meta-analyses sample), n = 551 net studies.\n\n|Year|Correlation Factor|\n|---|---|\n|1972|0.8|\n|1977|0.6|\n|1982|0.4|\n|1987|0.2|\n|1992|0|\n|2002|-0.2|\n\n# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment\n\nstakeholder issues also lead to changing ESG–CFP patterns over time present a fuzzy picture (Pavie and Filho 2008; Rubera and Kirca 2012; Albertini 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014) (Table 2).\n\nOut of the 1214 primary studies in meta-analyses, 551 studies possess transparent correlation coefficients and publication years. For this sub-sample, we do not find indications to support the learning hypothesis. Although the dispersion of effects, positive and negative alike, increase since the beginning of the 1990s, the aggregated picture stays unchanged. Besides simple observations of the regression line, the time-invariant relation is supported\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>G.
