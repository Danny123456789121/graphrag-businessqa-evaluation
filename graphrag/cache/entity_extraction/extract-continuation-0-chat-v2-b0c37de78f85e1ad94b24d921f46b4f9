might be worth mentioning. First, regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions tend to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples (positive events: r = .053, 95 % CI: .001 to –.106 for US samples vs. r = .092, 95 % CI: .008 to –.175 for non-US samples, negative events: r = -.164, 95 % CI: -.230 to -.096 vs. r = -.228, 95 % CI: -.339 to -.110). Second, while the population rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000, the r regarding positive events before the year 2000 was not significant (r = .032, 95 % CI: -.054 to –.117), contrary to the r pertaining to positive events as of the year 2000 (r = .077, 95 % CI: .023 to –.131). Finally, for negative events, both the r calculated from studies which controlled for confounding events as well as the r derived from studies not accounting for this issue were significant (r = -.139, 95 % CI: -.22 to -.054 and r = -.219, 95 % CI: -.298 to -.137). For positive events, only the r calculated from studies that controlled for confounding events was significant (r = .093, 95 % CI: .030 to –.156). To some extent these partially non-significant effects regarding positive events may be a further indication that the stock market reactions to negative events are more robust and generalizable than those to positive events.\n\n# Discussion and Conclusion\n\nSeveral studies examined the market reactions to CEP-related events and yielded mixed results. In an attempt to reconcile this inconsistency, the current work accumulated the empirical evidence of 29 event studies by means of meta-analysis. This study adds to the established body of cumulative evidence concerning the CEP–CFP link as it complements the existing meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014), which did not incorporate event study findings. Overall, my results corroborate the existing meta-analytic evidence of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP by demonstrating.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nthat there is a positive market reaction to positive CEP-related events and a negative reaction to negative events. Moreover, due to the nature of event studies, these meta-an\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CEP-RELATED EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>CEP-related events refer to occurrences that impact corporate environmental performance and are analyzed for their effects on financial performance in the stock market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US SAMPLES<|>EVENT<|>US samples are a subset of data used to analyze market reactions to CEP-related events within the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NON-US SAMPLES<|>EVENT<|>Non-US samples are a subset of data used to analyze market reactions to CEP-related events outside the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
