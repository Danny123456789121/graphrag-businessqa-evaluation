Financial sector regulations focus mainly on risk-adjusted.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999\n\nfinancial capital provisions, financial risks, and guaranteeing the stability of the financial industry. Newer approaches, however, also address the impact of the financial sector on sustainable development and risks for the stability of the financial industry caused by sustainability risks, such as climate change [55]. Mainly, regulations and policies addressing the impact of climate change on the financial sector are discussed, for instance, by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures [56], but also in academia [57].\n\nFinancial sector sustainability regulations are implemented mainly for two reasons: (1) to increase green lending and investment and (2) to enhance the financial sector’s financial stability [7, 18, 58]. The financial sector sustainability regulation that is most frequently discussed in academic publications is the Chinese Green Credit Policy, introduced by the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012 [6]. Whether the Chinese regulation has achieved its goals is controversial. Zhao and Xu [59] state that the Green Credit Policy will increase green lending and consequently contribute to sustainable development. Additionally, studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of Chinese banks found that banks with a higher green lending ratio and higher sustainability performance are exposed to lower risks [7–9]. Jiguang and Zhiqun [60] are more critical and claim that additional regulations and internationalization is needed to promote green finance, particularly carbon finance. Similarly, another study asks for better implementation mechanisms to guarantee the success of the green credit policy [10]. A study that addresses financial industry sustainability regulations in South America from a macro perspective, however, found a positive effect of these regulations on the financial stability of the financial industry [58].\n\nThe need to increase capabilities to become more sustainable, even in the presence of regulations, is emphasized by two studies. They suggest that environmental risk management practices have to be improved to avoid a trade-off between the sustainability performance of banks and their financial performance [61,62].\n\nA study that addresses the implementation problem in Bangladesh came to a similar conclusion. Though there is a potential for sustainable banking to have positive effects on banks’ financial performance, the necessary capabilities for sustainable banking, such as sustainable credit rating expertise and systems, are often missing [18]. Additionally, a study analyzing the situation in India suggests that the public sector banking industry addresses sustainability in a defensive and preventive way. The research indicates that banks adopt the regulatory norms but are not pro-active in addressing sustainable development in their business [45].\n\nPositive impacts of sustainable banking on sustainable development, however, have been identified in a study analyzing Nigerian banks [63]. Similar to banks in China and Bangladesh, Nigerian banks are regulated through a sustainable banking policy overseen by the domestic banking regulator [55]. Hence, such regulations might change banks toward a direction where they contribute to sustainable development and reduce their financing of unsustainable businesses and projects [64].\n\nBangladesh Bank introduced the Environmental Risk Management (ERM) Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh in 2011 [5]. Their goal is to incentivize banks to integrate environmental and social criteria into their credit risk management procedures and consequently to improve the environmental and social standards in Bangladesh’s industries. ERM introduced guidelines and tools to improve the sustainability assessment as well as refinancing schemes for environmentally sustainable projects [18]. Consequently, if adopted, the policy should influence the environmental sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks. Several studies assessing the corporate sustainability performance of Bangladesh companies and banks, however, suggest that corporate sustainability and corporate sustainability reporting is on a low level compared to other countries.\n\nOne of the earliest studies, as well as newer research on corporate sustainability reporting in Bangladesh, state that both the quantity and the quality of environmental disclosures are poor compared to those in many other countries [34, 65], though many stakeholders in Bangladesh ask for transparent corporate reporting [66]. The reasons for the lack of disclosure are a shortage of resources, the exclusive\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999\n\nfocus on profit, lack of legal requirements, lack of awareness and capacity, poor sustainability performance, and the fear of bad publicity [67]. Additionally, studies on the sustainability reporting of Bangladeshi banks echo these results [12]. Khan and Islam [13], for instance, found that only a few Bangladeshi banks address all the criteria proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative. For example, only a few banks conduct environmental disclosure [68]. A reason for these results might be low stakeholder pressure, particularly from the general public [15]. Since 2010, however, funds allocated to green banking are increasing in Bangladesh, though the absolute value is still low [11]. Finally, public commercial banks in Bangladesh adopted the ERM guideline and increased their green lending [16] as well as their sustainability activities [69]. To close the gap in the literature about the adoption of green banking regulations in South Asia, the objective of our study is to analyze the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks, the connection between their sustainability performance and financial performance, and the influence of the banks’ size and their sustainability performance.\n\n# 3. Theory\n\nThe study is based on legitimacy theory [20]. In line with Suchman, we define legitimacy as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of Bangladeshi banks are appropriate within the norms created by the regulator Bangladesh Bank. Related research found that legitimacy-based sustainability activities of firms are reactions to external pressure [70]. The emphasis here lies on reactive, meaning that corporations do not engage in sustainability activities as a proactive way to increase their business performance but as a reaction to stakeholder pressure or events. Consequently, activities decrease when pressure decreases\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BANGLADESH BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bangladesh Bank is the central bank of Bangladesh responsible for regulating the banking sector and implementing sustainability guidelines for financial institutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE GREEN CREDIT POLICY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Green Credit Policy is a regulation introduced by the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012 aimed at increasing green lending and investment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGERIAN BANKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nigerian banks are regulated through a sustainable banking policy overseen by the domestic banking regulator, promoting sustainable development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability 2020 is a publication discussing various aspects of sustainability regulations and their impact on the financial sector.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERM GUIDELINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Environmental Risk Management Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh aim to integrate environmental and social criteria into credit risk management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH ASIA<|>GEO<|>South Asia is a region that includes countries like Bangladesh and India, where sustainable banking regulations are being analyzed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANGLADESH<|>GEO<|>Bangladesh is a country where the banking sector is implementing sustainability regulations and guidelines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where the public sector banking industry is addressing sustainability in a defensive manner.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANGLADESH BANK<|>ERM GUIDELINES<|>Bangladesh Bank introduced the ERM Guidelines to improve environmental sustainability in the banking sector<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANGLADESH<|>BANGLADESH BANK<|>Bangladesh Bank is the central bank of Bangladesh, regulating its financial institutions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE GREEN CREDIT POLICY<|>NIGERIAN BANKS<|>Both the Chinese Green Credit Policy and Nigerian banks' regulations aim to promote sustainable development in their respective countries<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANGLADESH<|>SOUTH ASIA<|>Bangladesh is a country located in South Asia, where sustainable banking regulations are being studied<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>BANGLADESH<|>India and Bangladesh are both countries in South Asia addressing sustainability in their banking sectors<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>BANGLADESH<|>Sustainability 2020 discusses sustainability regulations and their impact on the financial sector in Bangladesh<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>CHINESE GREEN CREDIT POLICY<|>Sustainability 2020 includes discussions on the Chinese Green Credit Policy and its implications for sustainable finance<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
