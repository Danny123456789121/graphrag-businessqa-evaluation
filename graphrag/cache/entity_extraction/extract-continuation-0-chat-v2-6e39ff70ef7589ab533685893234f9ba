We adopted Pearson product-moment correlation (r) in our meta-analysis because it is a widely used effect size statistic with scale free in management studies (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Several studies were found to report correlations linking CSR with various performance components (e.g., both return on assets and return on equity for financial performance). Following Ellis’s (2006) method, we averaged the correlations across them within each study to arrive at a mean performance score. Following Hedge and Olkin, we applied Fisher’s Zr-transformation procedures to correct the distribution of effect sizes because of the assumption that effect sizes are normally distributed (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Correlations based on large research offer greater precision than in small studies because of smaller sampling errors (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter & Schmidt, 1990), so we weighted each effect size by adopting its inverse variance weight to obtain the accurate mean effects. Then we used the weights to calculate the standard error of the mean effect and the upper and lower bounds of 95 % confidence interval (Whitener, 1990). We also calculated the Q-statistic to test the homogeneous distribution of effect sizes and estimate the likelihood of moderators that explain the variability in correlations over studies (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).\n\nWe divided extant studies into mutually exclusive groups and applied subgroup meta-analysis in each CSR domain (environmental CSR and social CSR) and business performance category (financial performance and operational performance), to compare.\n\nComprehensive meta-analysis (CMA), http://www.meta-analysis.com/.\n\n# Results\n\n# Main Effects: CSR and business performance\n\nWith the help of meta-analytic techniques described above, we integrated the relationship between CSR and business performance as well as the moderating effects of contingency factors and reported the number of organizations (n), number of effect size (k), weight mean r, stand error, the corresponding 95 % confidence interval, and Q-statistic (see Table 2).\n\nIn our meta-analysis, Rosenberg’s (2005) fail-safe N is 3,320. This means that we need to locate and include 3,320 “null” studies for the combined 2-tailed p-value to exceed .05. Put another way, we would need 38 missing studies for every observed study for the effect to be nullified. Accordingly, the quality of our meta-analysis results can be assured.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\n# Step 1: Search\n\n# Step 2: Code\n\n# Step 3: Calculate\n\n|Electronic databases|CSR definition|\n|---|---|\n|No|Exclude|\n|Does it satisfy the inclusion criteria?|No|\n|Management journals|Overall analyses|\n|Does it satisfy the inclusion criteria?|No|\n|Reference lists|Moderator: economic|\n|Does it satisfy the inclusion criteria?|No|\n|Email (22 authors)|In total: 28 articles|\n\n# Fig. 2\n\nThe detailed process of meta-analysis\n\nWe first estimated the average effect sizes between overall CSR and business performance and obtained a positive significant result (r = .158, k = 87, 95 % CI = .150–.165). The correlation is significant because the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals do not include zero. The significant heterogeneity Q-value (2,411.421) suggests the existence of moderators. This finding encourages us to conduct further research for potential moderators. Table 2 shows subgroup meta-analysis results suggesting a weak positive relationship between CSR and financial performance (r = .098, k = 52, 95 % CI = .089–.106). We also found CSR has a significant positive association with operational performance (r = .426, k = 28, 95 % CI = .409–.441). Besides, we found the relationship between environmental CSR (r = .434, k = 16, 95 % CI = .397–.469) and business performance is stronger than the social CSR–business link (r = .039, k = 9, 95 % CI = .024–.055). Based on those results, we conclude that CSR and various indicators of business performance have positive relationships. Therefore, Hypotheses 1 and 2 are supported. The meta-analysis results also indicate that the average effect of CSR on operational performance (r = .426, k = 28, 95 % CI = .409–.441) is much greater than on financial performance (r = .098, k = 52, 95 % CI = .089–.106). This result confirms Hypothesis 3, indicating that CSR brings distinctly different benefits in terms of nature and type.\n\n# Moderating effects\n\nRegarding the moderating role of economic development, meta-regression results show that CSR has a larger effect size for developing economies than developed economies (β = −.120, p = .028) in East Asia. Table 3 provides the detailed findings for the moderating variable of economic development. Hypothesis 4 is supported. This research finding conforms to our reasoning that economic development is an important moderator in the CSR–business link.\n\n# Meta-analytic results of CSR\n\n|Effect sizes|Number of organizations (n)|Weighted mean (r)|Standard error|95% Confidence interval|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1.
