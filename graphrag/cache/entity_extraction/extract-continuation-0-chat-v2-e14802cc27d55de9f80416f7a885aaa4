Our general reasoning for distinguishing between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR in our moderator analysis is provided later on in the article. In short, environmental issues are more technical in nature, while social issues to a greater degree involve moral and ethical reasoning aspects. Therefore, the effect of female board representation might differ with regard to the specific dimensions of CSR.\n4. Both perspectives—the substitution perspective and the complementarity perspective—are represented in recent corporate governance research and the empirical evidence is ambiguous (Misangyi & Acharya, 2014; Oh et al., 2018; Rediker & Seth, 1995; Ward et al., 2009).\n5. Gender parity as a potential moderator makes only sense for the relationship between female board representation and CSR, but not for the other focal relationships. Therefore, H7 exclusively pertains to female board representation.\n6. The creation of a composite correlation results in a more construct valid measure of the construct of interest (Higgins et al., 2003; Ones & Viswesvaran, 1996).\n7. According to Rosenthal (1979), the file drawer tolerance is set at 5X + 10, where X is the number of available effect sizes.\n8. We also compared our results with a baseline model, in which all of the board characteristics—also the presence of a CSR committee—are directly related to CSR (i.e., a one-to-one direct model). This model showed a slightly inferior fit to the data as indicated by the fit indices and the chi-square difference test was non-significant.\n9. As robustness tests, we also estimate meta-regressions without the effect sizes for which we had to calculate the average due to multiple countries in the primary study sample. In all cases the results remained qualitatively similar.\n10. With regard to the relationship between the presence of a CSR committee and CSR, only one study was available exclusively focusing on the social dimension, thus not allowing a meaningful analysis.\n\n# References\n\nReferences marked with an asterisk (*) indicate studies included in the meta-analysis.\n\n- Aguilera, R.
