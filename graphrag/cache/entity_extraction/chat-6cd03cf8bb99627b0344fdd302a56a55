In 1975, the degree of urbanization was 72% in high-income countries, only 24% in low-income countries and 48% in middle-income countries. In addition, per capita energy use and emissions of the high-income group in 1975 and 2005 were also significantly higher than for the other income groups. In 1975, each person in the high-income group on average consumed about 3.6 tons of oil equivalents (toe) and generated over 9 metric tons of CO2, significantly greater than each person in the low-income group consumed (0.43 toe) and emitted (0.30 ton).\n\nThe figure also shows differential changes in urbanization levels, per capita energy use and emissions between 1975 and 2005 among the three income groups. Compared with the other groups, the middle-income group experienced a greater increase in its urbanization level, rising from 48% in 1975 to 65% in 2005. The growth in its per capita emissions was around 40%, slightly lower than the growth in its energy consumption (45%). Similarly, between 1975 and 2005, the per capita energy use of the high-income group increased by about 58%, while its per capita CO2 emissions grew only 37%. In contrast, in the low-income group, per capita energy use was nearly unchanged, whereas its per capita CO2 emissions increased approximately 23%.\n\nFig. 2 details the relative percentage changes in urbanization, population, energy intensity, CO2 emissions, energy use and CO2 intensity compared with the base year (1975 = 0). Note that the\n\n# Fig. 1. The level of urbanization, per capita energy use and emissions by income group in 1975 and 2003 (calculated using data from the World Bank (2007) and IEA (2008a,b,c)).\n\n|(a)|Low-income [1975 = 0]| |Middle-income| |High-income|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Energy (1975)|0|5.71|3.6|1.35|0.93|\n|Energy (2005)|370|340|310|280|220190|\n|Urbanization (1975)|60|50|40|30|20|\n|Urbanization (2005)|10|70|28|40|10|\n\n# (b) Middle-income [1975 = 0]\n\n|Emissions (1975)|16|14|12.52|10|8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Emissions (2005)|80|72|9.13|2|L|\n|Urbanization (1975)|40|30|20|10|220|\n|Urbanization (2005)| | | | | |\n\nchanges in energy use and CO2 emissions plotted in Figs. 2 and 1 are different as the former employs aggregate data, while the latter uses per capita data. The most significant change in urbanization in 2005 was in the low-income group, while the least change occurred in the high-income group because of its high degree of urbanization.\n\nSimilarly, the changes in the energy use and CO2 emissions of the low-income group in 2005 were significantly larger than those of the middle- and high-income groups. The change in the energy use of the low-income group was nearly 180%, while in the middle- and high-income groups, it was about 147% and 58%, respectively. Between 1975 and 2005, the emissions growth of the low-income group was nearly 357%, whereas it was about 132% in the middle-income group and only 38% in the high-income group.\n\nOver the period 1975–2003, while the energy intensity of the low-income group steadily declined below the year 1975 level, in the middle-income group, it fluctuated over time and then fell. Surprisingly, in the high-income group, it increased until 1988 and then started declining. However, it was still above the base year level. This is mainly due to the fact that this income group consists of several major oil exporting countries, largely influencing the group's average energy intensity.\n\n# 4.2. Empirical Results and Discussion\n\nTable 2 reports the estimated results for the whole sample, while Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the results of the low-, middle- and high-income groups, respectively. As the FD models (Models 4, 8, 12 and 16) are the preferred models, our main interpretations focus only on these models.\n\n# Fig. 2. Relative percentage changes in urbanization, population, energy intensity, CO2 emissions, energy use and carbon intensity by income groups compared with their 1975 level (calculated using data from the World Bank (2007) and IEA (2008a,b,c)).\n\nP. Poumanyvong, S. Kaneko / Ecological Economics 70 (2010) 434–444 441\n\nThe estimated coefficients in the FD model (Model 4 listed in Table 2) are all statistically significant at the 5% level or lower, except for the coefficient of urbanization. The relationship between urbanization and energy use is positive but insignificant, whereas population size, GDP per capita and economic structure positively affect energy use. The elasticity of energy use to population growth is 1.23, while the elasticity to GDP per capita is 0.316. A 1% increase in the share of the industrial and service sector in the economy raises energy use by 0.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
