However, social sustainability issues and pandemic problems from COVID-19 have affected corporations and interrupted plans for sustainable development. To date, corporate sustainability frameworks have taken a relatively narrow view of this paradigm. This study highlights serious challenges to corporate sustainability while providing a framework in an attempt to enable more sustainable business practices. To fill the gap in the literature, we have developed a framework to organize and prioritize important sustainability indicators. The first phase of the study involves the classification of 45 sub-criteria of corporate sustainability under nine main categories by using a literature review and novel Fuzzy Delphi method. The resulting categories are Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economic, Environmental, Social, Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, Energy Consumption along with Energy Saving, and includes Pandemic COVID-19 as a new aspect of social sustainability. Next, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to help determine the weights and prioritizing the criteria and sub-criteria. The results revealed that the Pandemic, along with the Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, ranked higher among the main criteria category. Whereas, emergency response planning, social distances, modification of working hours, and just-in-time delivery are the most influencing sub-attributes among the 45 sub-barriers of different categories. Contributions of this study include new insights regarding corporate sustainability criteria and subcriteria, application of novel methods, and integrated framework for dimensions of corporate sustainability. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an essential category and social sustainability attribute of corporate sustainable business practices. Outcomes of this study can help assist scholars, corporations, and decision-makers in understanding sustainable development initiatives while simultaneously improving social sustainability practices.\n\n# Keywords\n\ncorporate sustainability; social dimensions; Fuzzy AHP; COVID-19; ranking\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nSustainable development is the potential to fulfill today‚Äôs needs without undermining a future generation‚Äôs ability to satisfy their needs [1]. Sustainability has become a significant alternative to business as usual, which appears to focus primarily on short-term productivity with little or no social and environmental impacts considered over the long term [2]. Despite this, the business environment\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 8747; doi:10.3390/su12208747\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nis changing rapidly, guided by social, economic, and ecological developments [3, 4]. For these and other aligned reasons, companies have become increasingly interested in corporate sustainability; see, for example, Christ et al. [5] and Manrique and Mart√≠-Ballester [6]. While managers have noticed that the integration of sustainability is an opportunity, they rarely consider it in tactical management decisions [7]. The consideration of sustainability in corporate strategy and processes has become one promising way of dealing with a changing business landscape and increasing pressure for social sustainability performance. Since decisions relating to sustainability are made at a strategic level, there has also been an increasing scientific interest in the field of strategic management in connection with the inclusion of sustainability in the strategy, vision, change management, and culture of a company [8].\n\nDue to the variety of different sustainability initiatives, there is an ongoing opportunity for researchers to quantify what ongoing and emerging practices look like [9]. Yet, there has been so much published by researchers that it can be an overwhelming amount of information to sort through. Add to this, the idea that stakeholders are continually seeking more information beyond financial performance by wanting to see the ecological and social policies of a company [10], and the importance of understanding corporate sustainability continues to grow. Corporate sustainability reporting can be a primary motivation for organizations to communicate with stakeholders about sustainability initiatives. This gets difficult due to the terminology and growing categories of these diverse efforts. For example, firms have been reporting the use of different terminologies, e.g., corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainable development (SD), economic and non-economic reporting, and referring to the main pillars of sustainability which are social, environmental, and economic (SEE), and triple bottom line (TBL). The evolution of such reporting is fascinating. Tschopp and Huefner [11] found that the companies were focusing on environmental management compliance reporting during the 1970s and 1980s, and they also observed a weak relation between sustainability reporting and organization performance. Later, in the 1990s, sustainability reporting on occupational health and safety (OHS) was observed, and a paradigm shift to reporting on societal-based activities, accompanied by institutionalization.\n\nConsidering that each participant in society has its unique responsibility to engage sustainable development at a global scale, corporate sustainability reflects the organizations‚Äô part to global challenges of sustainable development [12], including depletion of natural resources and social sustainability.
