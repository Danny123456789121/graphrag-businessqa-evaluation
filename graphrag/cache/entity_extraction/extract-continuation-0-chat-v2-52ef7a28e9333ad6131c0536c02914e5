Introduction\n\nClimate change and sustainability have drawn broad attention internationally. World leaders have found a general consensus on this issue, as stated in the 2015 Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While member countries have agreed to work cooperatively to mitigate the severe problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, one of the major challenges is the financing mitigation and adaptation action to climate change and sustainability. Significant amount of investment is needed for solving the problem. Maintaining the 2° C temperature threshold of the Paris Agreement requires $53 trillion in energy-related investments by 2035 (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2014).\n\nJi and Zhang (2019) document that financial development is a critical determinant for the further progress of China’s renewable energy sector. In 2010, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established by 194 countries, aiming to provide financial support to developing countries to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. Since then, the term “green finance” has frequently appeared in reports of international organizations (see for example, IFC, 2017) and national governments. Relevant discussions have also attracted enormous attention from academics. Green finance per se, however, remains vaguely defined and is often mixed with climate finance.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nIt is often hard to distinguish between green finance and climate finance. According to IFC (2017), green finance is defined as “financing of investments that provide environmental benefits”, whereas the latter is proposed and defined by UNFCCC as “local, national or transnational financing-drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing-that seeks to support mitigation and adaption actions that will address climate change”.\n\nThough subtly different in definitions, at the heart of both terms is the financing tools for coping with climate change and others for sustainability.1\n\nGreen finance clearly has paramount policy importance, reflected by the intensive discussions among international organizations and national governments since its emergence. It has also led to increasing interest among academic researchers.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DAYONG ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Dayong Zhang is a researcher affiliated with the Research Institute of Economics and Management at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, and is a co-author of the manuscript on green finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHIWEI ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Zhiwei Zhang is a researcher and co-author of the manuscript on green finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHUNSUKE MANAGI<|>PERSON<|>Shunsuke Managi is a researcher affiliated with the Urban Institute & School of Engineering at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, and is a co-author of the manuscript on green finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Southwestern University of Finance and Economics is an educational institution in Chengdu, China, where Dayong Zhang is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYUSHU UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kyushu University is an educational institution in Fukuoka, Japan, where Shunsuke Managi is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN CLIMATE FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Green Climate Fund was established in 2010 by 194 countries to provide financial support to developing countries for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Finance Research Letters is the journal in which the manuscript on green finance is set to be published.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change that aims to limit global warming and was established within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Energy Agency is an organization that provides policy advice and analysis on energy issues, including the financial requirements for climate change mitigation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAYONG ZHANG<|>FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS<|>Dayong Zhang is a co-author of the manuscript that will be published in Finance Research Letters<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHIWEI ZHANG<|>FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS<|>Zhiwei Zhang is a co-author of the manuscript that will be published in Finance Research Letters<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHUNSUKE MANAGI<|>FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS<|>Shunsuke Managi is a co-author of the manuscript that will be published in Finance Research Letters<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAYONG ZHANG<|>SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS<|>Dayong Zhang is affiliated with Southwestern University of Finance and Economics<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHUNSUKE MANAGI<|>KYUSHU UNIVERSITY<|>Shunsuke Managi is affiliated with Kyushu University<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN CLIMATE FUND<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>The Green Climate Fund was established as part of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<|>GREEN CLIMATE FUND<|>The International Energy Agency provides analysis that informs the financial requirements for initiatives like the Green Climate Fund<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
