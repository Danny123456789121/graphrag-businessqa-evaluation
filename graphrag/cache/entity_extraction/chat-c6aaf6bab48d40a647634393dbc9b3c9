Further work could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual reductions have little impact on final automation results.\n\n# Wage evolution\n\nWe model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply country-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US dollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 base) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for each country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which we have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage distribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We reclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate growth rate is applied.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier 59\n\n# Adoption and deployment\n\nAdoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors can hinder or enable the timing and the pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different technologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities into current technical platforms and combine them into an organic entity. Barriers also exist on the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks to implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology innovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have varied levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.\n\nTo incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-known and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting and technology forecasting.\n\nf(t) = (p + qF(t)) / (1 - F(t))\n\nF(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and f(t) is the corresponding rate of change.\n\nThe function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (the inherent tendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of consumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary least square regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta analyses can be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.\n\nWe then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The technologies we used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking systems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, electronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The fitted values of parameters p and q are consistent with other academic research. It takes about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 years in the latest scenario.\n\n# 2. Work hours that could be automated\n\nThe impact of automation on work hours across different capability levels is estimated below for the technical automation potential and automation adoption:\n\n- Impact by occupation by scenario: Number of FTEs X % automation estimate by scenario\n- Impact by activity: Number of FTEs X time spent on activity per year X percent automation estimate by scenario\n- Impact by occupation group: Σoccupation (Number of FTEs X percent automation estimate by scenario)\n\n# 3. Impact of automation on productivity\n\nWe used GDP per FTE as the measure of productivity. We calculated automation output under different scenarios by multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We considered only job activities that are available and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, we assumed that automation has a labor.\n\n6 FTEs whose job titles include these detailed work activities.\n\n7 For occupations included within the occupation group.\n\n# 60 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nsubstitution effect but no other performance gains. Finally, we assumed that labor replaced by automation will rejoin the workforce at the same level of productivity as today. We also assumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, even if the total number of FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes.\n\nUnder the assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption by country as follows:\n\nAdditional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity\n\nThe additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the productivity impact of automation.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n61\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThe research underpinning this report was led by Michael Chui, an MGI partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office; Eric Hazan, a senior partner in the Paris office; Roger Roberts, a partner in the Bay Area office; Alex Singla, a senior partner in the Chicago office; Kate Smaje and Alex Sukharevsky, senior partners in the London office; Lareina Yee, a senior partner in the Bay Area office; and Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner in the New York office.\n\nThe project team included Dmitry Gafarov, Shivani Gupta, Dan Hababou, Leila Harouchi, Sonja Lindberg, Kerin Lo, Alexandre Pons, Alok Singh, Gurneet Singh Dandona, and Wilbur Wang.\n\nThis research benefited immensely from the expertise and perspectives of many McKinsey colleagues.
