Our approach is agnostic about the extent to which unanticipated temperature shocks signal changes in climate. In the Web Appendix we show that five-year average temperature shocks in the U.S. are highly persistent in the period 1950-2014 with a coefficient of 0.70 (whereas this coefficient is 0.17 in the period from 1895-1950). This persistence may merely be indicative of temporary warming/cooling trends rather than permanent changes in climate. The importance of temperature shocks, however, definitely extends beyond the current period. Our approach isolates the changes in value of firms resulting from the temperature shocks, thus providing a discounted sum of the market-perceived impacts over time irrespective of whether these reflect transitory trends or permanent climate change.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nboth·Z1 and·Z1,·the·latter·a·vector·of·conditioning·climate·variables·known·at·t−1.·Therefore,·ECt−\n\nEt−1(R)=dZE1·and·Et1t−−(t+12)=f ZE1+gZC1.·Then·we·have·from·equations·(1),·(2),·and·(3)\n\nthat·T+12=[c+at+t f ZE1+gZC1t−]+[b(Rt−dZE1t−)+t]+ +12,·which·provides:··t\n\n# Primary Specification\n\nT+12=c+at+eZE1+gZC1+bRt+ +12·······························\n\nwith·e−bd+f·and·t+12t+ +12.·Note·that·while·we·consider·temperatures·based·on·annual·averages,·which·sidesteps·seasonal·issues,·we·continue·to·utilize·the·additional·information·in·monthly·control·variables·and·returns·to·measure·coefficients·more·precisely.\n\nTracking·portfolio·returns·are·defined·here·as·the·“factor·mimicking”·portfolios·of·excess·returns,·bRt.·The·OLS·regression·given·by·equation·(4)·can·be·used·to·estimate·the·portfolio·weights·b·to·obtain·bRt.·The·tracking·portfolio·return·that·traces·the·changes·in·expectations·regarding·temperature·variation,·the·temperature·shock·factor,·is·accordingly·TSF =bRt.\n\nThe·unconditional·mean·of·the·tracking·portfolio·returns·bE(tR) represents·the·factor·risk·premium·(see·Lamont,·2001,·Vassalou,·2003,·and·Kapadia,·2011),·which·is·in·our·application·the·factor·risk·premium·of·the·temperature·shock·factor.·The·intuition·is·that·the·estimated·coefficients·b·represent·basis·asset·loadings·on·the·temperature·variation·news.·The·portfolio·with·weights·b·on·the·basis·assets·has·a·mean·excess·return·bE(tR)·that·reflects·the·risk·due·to·temperature·news·and·can·be·interpreted·as·the·risk·premium·on·the·temperature·shock·factor.·If·temperature·variation·impacts·are·generally·adverse·(e.g.,·Dell,·Jones·and·Olken,·2014),·we·expect·to·see·a·negative·premium:·since·the·loadings·on·the·temperature·shock·factor·should·normally·be·negative,·and·to·compensate·for·additional·risk,·the·equilibrium·return·should·be·higher,·which,·with·negative·loadings,·can·only·be·achieved·by·a·negative·risk·premium.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nFollowing the tracking portfolio literature, we focus on news concerning next year’s temperature variation.
