Companies are influenced by macro-level developments such as new environmental regulations and by meso-level context such as social industry standards and guidelines. At the same time, companies are expected to contribute to sustainability transformations of markets at the meso-level and to solving grand sustainability problems at the macro-level such as the greenhouse effect. These developments increase and change sustainability information needs of managers and management accounting. This paper provides a systematic literature review of how sustainability management accounting (SMA) addresses links with the organization’s contexts and contributions to sustainability transformations beyond organizational boundaries. The analysis questions the conventional assumption of an internal scope for SMA. It recognises this as a problematic constricting assumption in the literature and, instead, proposes a multi-level Context, Action-formation and Transformative contributions (CAT) framework for further development of SMA.\n\n# Funding information\n\nStiftung Nordakademie, Grant/Award Number: Sustainability Accounting 2020\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nInvolvement of the private corporate sector is vital if sustainable development is to be achieved (Atkinson, 2000). Managers need to consider sustainability in their decisions, and this requires support from accounting to raise awareness of desired and undesired environmental, social and economic impacts (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2018). Corporate sustainability management accounting (SMA) organizes the collection, analysis and communication of environmental, social and economic information for internal use by the organization’s managers. Nevertheless, scepticism about corporate sustainability management, accounting and reporting has been prominent in various publications influencing the research agenda, as some authors see sustainability concerns and solutions resting more at national and global levels than with businesses (Gray, 2010). Moreover, questions arise over the extent to which SMA considers sustainability at societal and planetary boundary levels (Gray, 2010; Linnenluecke & Smith, 2019; Rockström et al., 2009; Whiteman et al., 2013). To make progress with informed corporate sustainability management, SMA needs to support organizations in analysing and managing links with macro- and meso-level.\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. © 2022 The Authors.

These include, for example, clarification about how business is integrated in its environment, how it operates within the scope of planetary boundaries, and how it sources supplies without negative sustainability impacts in supply chains.\n\nEmergence of a number of global environmental, social and economic problems, ranging through climate change, water crises, gender equality, global poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic and policies such as the EU Green Deal, has led to greater concern about the lack of sustainability (Eckert & Kovalevska, 2021). It has brought pressure encouraging development of a more comprehensive, integrated approach to corporate sustainability management, supported by accounting and reporting (e.g., Linnenluecke et al., 2015; Whiteman et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a contemporary review and analysis of contexts and outcomes and the potential role of accounting for management to contribute to sustainable development beyond the organization’s boundaries is missing. In order to further develop a research agenda which supports the contribution of business to sustainable development, this review investigates how existing SMA research explicitly considers the connection with sustainability at different levels, leading to the following research question: How does SMA literature address links with meso- and macro-level contexts and outcomes beyond organizational boundaries?\n\nUnderpinned by a multi-level framework, this study makes the following contributions. First, it uncovers the extent to which SMA research has explicitly addressed links between the organization, macro-level (e.g., planetary ecological boundaries) and meso-level (e.g., sustainability transformation of supply chains). The review reveals a growing number of publications addressing macro- and meso-micro links. These highlight various aspects of the business environment in general, indicating that regulations, networks and ecological necessities, do or can influence the context for SMA (e.g., Qian et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019). Second, the review indicates few publications examine how SMA could be further developed to better inform management about macro- and meso-level contextual factors.
