We hypothesize the following:\n\n# Hypothesis 7 (H7):\n\nCountries’ gender parity positively moderates the relationship between CSR and female representation on boards.\n\nCSR is a multidimensional construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; H. Wang et al., 2016). Different studies use different measures of overall CSR performance and/or different measures of specific dimensions of CSR. Aggregate measures of CSR subsume dimensions that are not necessarily related to each other, such as environmental performance and social performance (H. Wang et al., 2016). The environmental and social aspects of CSR differ substantially, because environmental issues tend to be more systemic, affect multiple organizational and operational functions, and involve factors that are internally focused (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Russo & Fouts, 1997). Therefore, it is likely that the relationships between board characteristics and CSR systematically differ depending on whether an aggregate measure of CSR is used or whether a measure explicitly focusing on the environmental or the social dimension of CSR is applied in primary studies. Hence, acknowledging the importance of unpacking the dimensions of CSR and to provide a more fine-grained analysis, our final hypothesis is:\n\n# Hypothesis 8 (H8):\n\nThe dimension of CSR (aggregate, social, or environmental) moderates the relationships between CSR and the board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, CEO–chair duality, and the presence of a CSR committee.\n\n# Method\n\n# Identification of Studies\n\nWe employed three complementary procedures to identify prior empirical studies. First, we conducted a keyword search in the following databases:\n\n# Business & Society 00(0)\n\nBusiness Source Complete, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Wiley Online Library, using the following search string: (“board” OR “CEO” OR “corporate governance”) AND (“CSR” OR “corporate social” OR “environmental performance” OR “environmental responsibility” OR “sustainability”).\n\nSecond, we searched for unpublished manuscripts in the Social Science Research Network database. Third, we employed an ancestry approach (Aguinis et al., 2011) and searched through the reference lists of the studies identified in the preceding steps and in the narrative review of Jain and Jamali (2016) and the meta-analysis of Byron and Post (2016).\n\nTo be included in our analysis, studies needed to report a bivariate correlation between our focal board characteristic constructs and a measure of CSR (i.e., a measure of aggregate CSR or the environmental or the social dimension of CSR). The constructs from which correlations are reported did not have to be the main focus of the study (Dalton & Dalton, 2005). This procedure is in line with general meta-analytic practice (Geyskens et al., 2009) and potentially decreases the risk of biased meta-analytic results due to publication bias—the fact that statistically significant results are more likely to have been published (Post & Byron, 2015).\n\nThe final set of studies included in our analyses consists of 82 primary studies representing a total of 167,713 observations. These studies were published between the years 1991 and 2019 with a clear trend toward more studies being published in more recent years. The references of the studies used for the meta-analytic calculations are included in the supplemental file available online.\n\n# Coding of Studies\n\nWe coded the effect sizes of the focal relationships (i.e., the relationships between board characteristics and CSR), the effect sizes of the relationships between the board characteristics, because we need them for our meta-analytic path models, as well as information needed for our analyses of potential moderating effects. We initially coded a set of studies to establish and validate the coding rules, resolving ambiguous cases and differences in coding through discussion, before reaching consensus (Sleesman et al., 2012). Next, the first author of this study completed the rest of the coding. Finally, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the coding, we had an independent rater (postgraduate in management) that coded approximately one quarter (k = 20) of the studies (Carpenter & Berry, 2017). Apart from some minor discrepancies that were resolved through communicative validation (Kvale, 1995), the overall agreement was high and the calculated Cohen’s Kappa (.92) suggests almost perfect reliability (Landis & Koch, 1977).\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\nStudies in our sample measured board size as the number of board members. In one study (Bai, 2013), the number of directors was scaled by the size of the organizations. Board independence was measured by means of the number or proportion of outside directors. In cases where studies measured the number, proportion, or ratio of inside directors, we converted the sign of the correlation. The primary studies measured female board representation in different ways. In the majority of studies, the number or proportion of women on boards was used as a measure. Two studies (Jia & Zhang, 2012; Post et al., 2011) used a critical mass measure, which equals 1 if the board consists at least of three women. CEO–chair duality was either measured as binary variable equaling 1 if the CEO also serves as chairperson of the board or in a reverse manner (i.e., a variable that equals 1 if the CEO is not the chairman) (Surroca & Tribo, 2009). In the latter case we converted the sign of the correlation. With regard to the presence of a CSR committee, we conformed to the existing literature (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Mallin & Michelon, 2011) and regarded “environmental committees,” “sustainability committees,” or “corporate\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a multidimensional construct that encompasses various aspects of corporate governance, including environmental and social performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENDRIKAT ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Endrikat et al. is a reference to studies that measure board characteristics and their relationship with CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAIN AND JAMALI<|>PERSON<|>Jain and Jamali are referenced for their narrative review related to CSR and board characteristics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BYRON AND POST<|>PERSON<|>Byron and Post are referenced for their meta-analysis on CSR and board characteristics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS & SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business & Society is a journal that publishes studies related to corporate governance and CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Social Science Research Network is a database for unpublished manuscripts relevant to CSR studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Dixon-Fowler et al. are referenced for their work on CSR committees and environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSO & FOUTS<|>PERSON<|>Russo & Fouts are referenced for their studies on environmental performance in relation to CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DALTON & DALTON<|>PERSON<|>Dalton & Dalton are referenced for their work on correlations between board characteristics and CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAY<|>PERSON<|>Bai is referenced for a study measuring board size in relation to CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KVALE<|>PERSON<|>Kvale is referenced for communicative validation in coding studies related to CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLEESMAN ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Sleesman et al. are referenced for establishing and validating coding rules in CSR studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARPENTER & BERRY<|>PERSON<|>Carpenter & Berry are referenced for ensuring accuracy and reliability in coding CSR studies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENDRIKAT ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Endrikat et al. conducted studies measuring board characteristics in relation to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAIN AND JAMALI<|>CSR<|>Jain and Jamali provided a narrative review relevant to CSR and board characteristics<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BYRON AND POST<|>CSR<|>Byron and Post conducted a meta-analysis on CSR and board characteristics<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESS & SOCIETY<|>CSR<|>Business & Society publishes studies related to CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH NETWORK<|>CSR<|>Social Science Research Network is a source for unpublished manuscripts relevant to CSR<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Dixon-Fowler et al. studied the presence of CSR committees<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSO & FOUTS<|>CSR<|>Russo & Fouts conducted studies on environmental performance in relation to CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DALTON & DALTON<|>CSR<|>Dalton & Dalton studied correlations between board characteristics and CSR<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAY<|>CSR<|>Bai's study measured board size in relation to CSR<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KVALE<|>CSR<|>Kvale's work on communicative validation is relevant to the coding of CSR studies<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLEESMAN ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Sleesman et al. established coding rules for CSR studies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARPENTER & BERRY<|>CSR<|>Carpenter & Berry ensured the reliability of coding in CSR studies<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
