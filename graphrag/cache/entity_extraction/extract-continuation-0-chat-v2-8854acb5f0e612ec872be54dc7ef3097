Amplifications on the original reported number of included primary studies have been made, if not the entire sample was used. For four meta-analyses not all originally reported number of studies could be verified through data in the provided appendix and for three studies a condensed study set was used. The gross number of studies therefore decreases from 2091 to 1902 studies. Focus “S” and “E” denote a Social (S) or Environmental (E) focus. For studies with integrated S and E focus, the order of S and E indicates the relative weight of S vs. E studies. The indices (a) and (b) for the uncorrected effect size r indicate the source of the effect size in case, it was modified from the originally stated results: (a) transformed from d/g in r and (b) derived from stated corrected study results with either a meta-analysis provided individual attenuation factor or a calculated artifact attenuation factor of 0.72.\n\n# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment\n\nSummary information of review studies and all information reported on primary study level were imported and normalized for further statistical analysis. Not all primary studies were made transparent by the review authors. Eight review studies containing 929 primary studies (25.0% of the sample) were not identifiable on primary level. This meant that the results were included in the summary effects, but no further analysis on primary study level was possible. Within the remaining uniquely identifiable 2789 (gross) primary studies, the overlap within review studies was subsequently accounted for. The resulting net number of identifiable unique primary studies was n = 723 for the vote-count studies and n = 1214 for the meta-analyses. Of these, 259 studies overlap within the two review approaches – which brought the final number of unique identifiable primary studies in the sample to n = 1678. Those 259 overlapping studies remained within the vote-count studies and meta-analyses sample as separation to one or the other review approach was not possible without losing data granularity.\n\nBased on our sample of unique identifiable studies (n = 1678) and the number of nontransparent studies (n = 929), we estimated that at least 550 studies need to be added for a more complete estimate of the overall number of existing empirical studies on ESG–CFP published since the 1970s. This estimate was adjusted for the various overlaps within the vote-count studies and meta-analyses sample.\n\n# Methods\n\nTwo different ways for aggregation of the primary and secondary study results are applied, each with different calculation methods depending on the context. For comparability between results in the vote-count studies and meta-analyses, we compute distributions of outcomes and correlation effect sizes. Besides aggregated summary effects, we provide further fine-grained analysis on sub-group level. Depending on data availability in vote-count studies and meta-analyses, an analysis for different asset classes, regions, categories of E, S, and G as well the relation over time is conducted. When both vote-count studies and meta-analyses offer this information, the more comprehensive primary study sample is chosen. When the sub-sample stems from vote-count studies, the analysis focuses on the distribution of outcomes; when the sub-sample stems from meta-analyses, the focus is on effect sizes.\n\nRaw correlations, corrected correlations, sample sizes as well as corresponding variances, standard errors, confidence interval (CI), and credibility interval (CrI) have been extracted from the original meta-analyses as far as possible for further calculations. If necessary, some of the effect sizes and variances were transformed or derived for the calculation of a second-order meta-analysis.\n\n# Calculation of distributions\n\n# Vote-count studies\n\nDistributions of positive, negative, neutral, and mixed outcomes are calculated for vote-count studies based on the results of the gross study sample and the net study sample.
