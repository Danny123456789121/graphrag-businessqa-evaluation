It is often used when there are many studies with conflicting empirical results.\n\nOrlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) applied meta-analysis to 52 studies and documented that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility, is likely to be beneficial to future financial performance. Orlitzky et al. (2003) also found that corporate reputation appears to be an important mediator of the CSP-CFP relationship.\n\nWhy is a new meta-analysis necessary? While Orlitzky et al. (2003) looked at the moderating effect of CSR measures, this study extends Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) study by looking at different measures of financial performance as well. Accounting-based measures and market-based measures may account for some of the variance found in the prior literature. The authors also investigate the moderating effect of the short-term versus long-term CSP-CFP relationship. In addition, to address Ullman’s (1985) concern, sample characteristics (for example, sample size, sample period, country, and industry) and analysis methodologies are also examined.\n\nSince Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta-analysis was published, sustainability reporting has increased significantly. Most notably, companies are increasing their voluntary sustainability reporting or are required to disclose some of their sustainability performance on their SEC filings (such as form 10-K and 20-F). The United Nations has recommended that all big companies be required to publish corporate sustainability reports by 2030 (United Nations [UN] 2013).\n\nThis paper contributes to the current literature of the CSP-CFP relationship in the following ways. The meta-analysis provides a more rigorous review of past research. Traditional literature reviews of the CSP-CFP relationship have relied mostly on narrative reviews. Summaries from narrative literature reviews do not consider sampling and measurement errors and false inferences could be drawn from such reviews. Meta-analysis, however, considers cross-study variation in correlations between CSP and CFP and therefore renders more reliable inferences. These factors include sample size, sample period, measurement methods, industry differences, etc. For example, small sample sizes would show a relatively large sampling error. The focus of this study is not only to test the null hypothesis, but also to tell precisely how large the effect sizes really are. Sample-adjusted correlations were examined to compute the mean effect size and found that the effect size is medium according to Cohen’s (1988) rule of thumb (medium effect if the mean weighted corrected correlation is greater than 0.10 but less or equal to 0.25).\n\nIn addition to averaging research results, meta-analysis can also be helpful in finding potential moderators for future research. The moderator variable is used to split the studies into subsets. For each subset, meta-analysis is applied separately. A moderator is present if there are large differences in subset means. By breaking down the whole dataset into subsets to compare the relative magnitudes of correlations arising from different CSP and CFP sample size categories, this paper found the following moderators: accounting-based measures versus market-based measures; U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms; and environmental versus social studies. Analyzing methods used in individual studies can also affect the results. This study also addresses how different measures of sustainability performance and financial performance affect the CSP-CFP relationship. Meta-analysis suggests that CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators. This study includes 198 effect sizes from 36 articles and yields a total sample size of 31,514 observations. It was found that environmental responsibility contributes to a positive CSP-CFP relationship to a larger extent than social responsibility. In addition, multi-industry, pre-2000 studies, non-U.S. sample firms seem to show a stronger impact on the relationship between CSP and CFP than other sample indicators. The meta-analytic findings suggest a direction for future research.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related theories, literature review, and hypothesis development; Section III describes dataset development, the coding scheme, and methodology; Section IV presents preliminary.\n\nThere are two types of meta-analyses: cumulation of p-values (significance level) and cumulation of the mean effect size (or dr) across studies. In this study, we use the latter procedure to compute mean effect size.\n\nThe list of articles included in the meta-analysis is available as a downloadable Word file, see Appendix A.\n\nAmerican Journal of International Accounting Research\n\nAccounting Association Volume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?\n\n# FIGURE 1\n\n# Constructs, Sub-Constructs, and Measures\n\n| |Construct|Corporate Sustainability Performance|Corporate Financial Performance|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Sub-construct|Environmental Performance|Social Performance| |\n|Measures|Environ1|Social1|Financial1|\n| |Environ2|Social2|Financial2|\n| |Environ3|Social3|Financial3|\n\nIn this chart, the constructs and sub-constructs are indicated by ellipses, i.e., corporate sustainability performance, corporate financial performance, environmental performance, and social performance.
