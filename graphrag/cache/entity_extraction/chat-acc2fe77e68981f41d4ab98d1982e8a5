It is clear that nominally, the action the market responds to is either the reaction by the regulator or the report by the press. However, the underlying action this meta-analysis, such as the one on firms breaking tax laws, involves events in which the first cause is a firm's action, even though a regulator's reaction may be involved at some other point in the causal chain.\n\nWhich the firm chooses to take. The second phrase in the definition of a CSR event indicates that the actor must act out of choice, that is, with both freedom of will and willful purpose. In other words, for an actor to be a moral agent; there must be volition (Jones, 1991; Velasquez, 1992) and intention (French; 1986; Mackie, 1977). As a result, an event study that used airplane crashes (Bruning and Kuzma, 1989) as its event was not included in this meta-analysis because, as these authors observed, airplane crashes are frequently the result of bad weather or pilot error; In such cases choice is not involved. On the other hand, a study that examined FAA airline safety violations involving fines (Block, 1991) was included in this meta-analysis. The assumption here is that safety regulations are knowable and achievable by airline companies, and safety violations of some level involve an explicit or implicit decision on the part of management to not give safety observance the priority—that is, the energy, time, and money—it needs.\n\nThat substantially affects. Although substantial effect is rightfully part of the CSR event definition; it did not turn out to be a useful criterion for accepting or rejecting event studies for this meta-analysis. Basically, all studies found during the search procedure met this requirement—no researchers of event study examined actions that had insubstantial effects. The reasons for this seem obvious: First, such actions would be uninteresting to study, and second, if they were not of substantial effect they would not be newsworthy, and so there would be no data available on them.\n\nAn identifiable social stakeholder is. By identifiable, this part of the CSR event definition states that if the set of people being harmed by an action is actually an empty set, then no harm is being done. This notion.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nthat someone must be harmed for harm to have occurred can be located in the works of many philosophers (see, e.g-, Hobbes's [1651/1994] discussion of the justice of action versus the justice of manners and Mill's [1863/1992] discussions of justice and its 'ingredients'). By social stakeholder, I mean to draw the distinction between social and economic groups that the very phrase corporate social responsibility draws. In other words, I do not mean studying whether a firm is being economically responsible that is, generating wealth for its shareholders and creditors, for instance. Rather; I wish to direct attention at social stakeholders, such as communities, consumers, employees, and the environment.\n\nFor example, the investment advisory service, Value Line, ranks firms for timeliness based on predicted short-term price performance. An event study that investigated the market's response to Value Line's timeliness ratings (Affleck-Graves and Mendenhall, 1992) sought to determine how investors were being affected by the ratings. This was not of interest to this study because a social stakeholder's welfare did not seem to be at stake. However; an event study that examines the market's response to pollution ratings issued by the Council on Economic Priorities (Shane and Spicer; 1983) is of interest to this meta-analysis. It was included in this study because the many diverse stakeholders of a firm certainly include environmental activist groups (Freeman, 1984) whose welfare could be identified as being affected by firms' pollution performance. Furthermore, many would identify the natural environment itself as a stakeholder whose welfare would be directly affected by a firm's pollution performance.\n\n# Welfare\n\nThe final component of the CSR event definition has to do with people's welfare being affected. As James Rest (1986) has noted, ultimately for a situation or an event to be a moral issue, actions involved ethicists would argue that whether someone's welfare is being affected must have consequences affecting someone's welfare. Indeed, business lies at the very core of ethics and social responsibility (e.g, Hosmer; 1994). Therefore, a study that examined the market reaction to the \"purely cosmetic change\" of a company splitting its stock (Lamoureux and Poon; 1987: 1347) was not of interest to this meta-analysis. However; a study that examined the market's reaction to a company recalling products that is, defective or dangerous for consumers (Jarrell and Peltzman, 1985) was included in this meta-analysis. Thirty event studies were found to either fit the above definition or involve illegal behavior.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\nirresponsible and illegal behavior (actions where welfare is affected negatively), two studies (Meznar; Nigh, ad Kwok, 1994; Patten, 199\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
