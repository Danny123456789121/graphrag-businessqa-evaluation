Schmidt, Sara L. Rynes\n\n# Abstract\n\nMost theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions. With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP–CFP relationship than is currently assumed to exist by many business scholars.\n\n# Keywords\n\nsocial responsibility, business ethics, stakeholder theory, reputation, environmental management, correlation analysis\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe performance of business organizations is affected by their strategies and operations in market and non-market environments (Baron 2000). The increasing power of activist groups and the media in pluralist western societies can be expected to make organizations’ non-market strategies even more important. One construct that might capture a major element of these non-market strategies is corporate social performance (CSP). CSP can be defined as ‘a business organization’s configuration of principles of social responsibility, processes of social responsiveness, and policies, programs, and observable outcomes as they relate to the firm’s societal relationships’ (Wood 1991a: 693).\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n24(3): 403–441\n\nCopyright © 2003 SAGE Publications (London, Thousand Oaks, CA & New Delhi)\n\nwww.sagepublications.com\n\n0170-8406[200303]24:3;403–441;032910\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# 404 Organization Studies 24(3)\n\nThe impression that ‘in the aggregate, results are inconclusive’ regarding any theoretical conclusions about the relationship between CSP and corporate financial performance (CFP) has persisted until today (Jones and Wicks 1999: 212; cf. also Donaldson 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999). Ullmann (1985) and Wood and Jones (1995) argued that during the past three decades of empirical research on this relationship, researchers have engaged in a futile search for stable causal patterns. A number of narrative reviews and theories (for example, Aupperle et al. 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Husted 2000; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wartick and Cochran 1985; Wood 1991a, 1991b; Wood and Jones 1995) have proposed conceptual explanations for the existence (or lack thereof) of a causal relationship between CSP and CFP, but failed to provide clear answers. Previous reviews of this area have suggested that such factors as stakeholder mismatching (Wood and Jones 1995), the general neglect of contingency factors (for example, Ullmann 1985), and measurement errors (for example, Waddock and Graves 1997) may explain inconsistent findings. Other authors, failing to see important differences between theory and operational context, are even more pessimistic and call for a moratorium of CSP–CFP research (Margolis and Walsh 2001; Rowley and Berman 2000). Before we embark on a costly search for contingencies or abandon a line of inquiry altogether, a theoretically and empirically meaningful integration of this area might be useful. In this article, we argue that this line of inquiry contains a number of theoretical conclusions that have hitherto been overlooked or ignored by many organizational scholars.\n\nThis article presents a meta-analytic review of primary quantitative studies of the CSP–CFP relationship. Meta-analysis has proven to be a useful technique in many substantive areas where multiple individual studies have yielded\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARC ORLITZKY<|>PERSON<|>Marc Orlitzky is one of the authors of the meta-analysis on corporate social and financial performance published in Organization Studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK L.
