While a paradox perspective has been broadly incorporated into sustainability research for more than a decade, it has resulted in limited improvement in our understanding of corporate sustainability paradox management. In this study, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability paradox management by adopting the Smith–Lewis three-stage model of dynamic equilibrium. The results reveal the following:\n\n1. Both environmental and cognitive factors manifest tensions arising from the sustainability paradox.\n2. While both proactive and defensive strategies are adopted to manage the tensions embedded in the corporate sustainability, the proactive strategy is more extensively studied in the current literature.\n3. Management strategies of corporate sustainability paradox are characterized as multi-level, multi-stage, and dealing with multiple paradoxes.\n4. Proactive strategies enable organizations to enjoy short-term and long-term sustainability benefits.\n\nThe authors call for further research explicitly addressing the following areas:\n\n1. the paradoxical nature of corporate sustainability management;\n2. corporate sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations;\n3. the micro-foundations of corporate sustainability paradox management;\n4. defensive strategies and new proactive strategies; and\n5. a unified standard of sustainability outcomes.\n\nThe practical implications of this review are then elaborated. In practice, the results imply that organizations would best manage the corporate sustainability paradox by understanding the paradox and its equilibrium stages. This review and proposed research agenda are expected to deepen interdisciplinary knowledge and set the stage for interested scholars to undertake in their future inquiries.\n\n# Keywords:\n\ncorporate sustainability, paradox, tension, corporate social responsibility, social enterprise\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough organizations have been pursuing their economic goals as primary interests for a long time, concerns about the natural environment and social welfare have become essential for organizations to deal with when considering sustainable development (Gladwin et al., 1995; Bansal, 2002; Zollo et al., 2013). Corporate sustainability juxtaposes economic, social, and environmental.\n\n# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\ngoals in parallel (Bansal, 2005; Schaltegger et al., 2016) to achieve overall social welfare (Schwartz and Carroll, 2008). Organizations that proactively take up their social responsibility display impressive competitiveness and vitality (Thiel, 2017; Ivory and Brooks, 2018; Daddi et al., 2019). Meanwhile, socially or environmentally irresponsible behavior still commonly occurs, even though it hurts the companies’ image and reputation (Lin-Hi and Müller, 2013). While it is challenging to engage simultaneously with economic, social, and environmental goals, it is critical to consider how organizations and managers can successfully manage these multiple goals is critical to gain long-term competitiveness.\n\nThree theoretical perspectives have emerged to address the relationships among economic, social, and environmental responsibilities: business frame, win–win, and business case perspectives. The business frame perspective from earlier scholarly work proposes that pursuing profit goals is an organization’s primary responsibility and criticizes other pursuits as insignificant, as these essentially contradict an organization’s economic benefit (Friedman, 1970). Corporate sustainability scholars have almost abandoned such a view, as it assumes a narrow scope of corporate responsibility and ignores the social and environmental aspects of corporations’ operations (Wood, 1991; Hahn and Figge, 2011; Barnett, 2019). By contrast, the win–win perspective argues that both economic and social missions are attainable at the same time (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015). However, this view overemphasizes their reciprocity or interdependence and ignores the tensions from conflicts between these missions (Turban and Greening, 1997; Albinger and Freeman, 2000; Wagner, 2010), and the trade-offs between specific stakeholder groups are not always avoidable (Bridoux et al., 2016). Meanwhile, the business case frame regards these conflicts as being canceled out, by advocating the instrumental utilization of social pursuits to advance economic aims (Hahn et al., 2015; Hafenbrädl and Waeger, 2017); however, the business case frame has been criticized as insufficient to depict the true notion of corporate sustainability (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002; Hahn and Figge, 2011), resulting in opportunism and a lack of intrinsic motivation for corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement (Nijhof and Jeurissen, 2010).\n\nIn this study, the authors attempt to adopt a fourth perspective, the paradox perspective, to review how previous organizational sustainability research has deepened knowledge, echoing Margolis and Walsh’s (200\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
