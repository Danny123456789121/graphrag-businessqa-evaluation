Externally, philanthropic giving can enhance reputation. This might help to establish a more loyal customer base (Luo 2005), ensure the license to operate within communities (Lim 2010), and serve as a reputational insurance in case of negative events (Godfrey 2005). Furthermore, governmental and financial institutions might be more willing to support companies which are associated with strong community support (Ye and Zhang 2011).\n\nOrganizations also benefit from CP on the internal level. As Porter and Kramer (2002) describe, a business is unable to thrive without the right environment. This includes not only a community’s good will and infrastructure, but also its attractiveness for possible employees of the company. Companies need to attract a highly qualified and motivated workforce. Organizational values and belief systems (Simons 1994), which can be shaped and reinforced by mission statements, company CSR reports, as well as by corporate donations, can enhance employee identification and provide an enterprise with a competitive advantage to secure their access to these high-quality workers (Turban and Greening 1997; Balakrishnan et al. 2011; Arjalies and Mundy 2013). Moreover, employees within the company show higher job commitment and job performance when they feel that they are part of a company that believes in giving back to society (Ke et al. 2015). Finally, value systems supported by CSR and philanthropic\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\nactivities can provide opportunities for growth and innovation as, “in the absence of problems, belief systems motivate individuals to search for new ways of creating value” (Simons 1994).\n\nDespite the aforementioned rationales for a positive relationship between CP and CFP, there are also some arguments that propose a negative association of CP and CFP. When comparing different CSR activities for their strategic motivation and the associated business success, Schaltegger and Burritt (2015) argue that CP is a reactionary form of CSR. As such, CP is “neither expected nor implemented to generate profits but to keep critics at bay” (p. 10) and will mainly cause costs instead of leading to economic benefits (Schaltegger and Burritt 2015). Furthermore, even when assuming that well-intended and strategically directed donations might have positive effects on a firm’s financial performance, agency theory suggest that managers (i.e. agents) may show opportunistic behavior when deciding over CP activities (Iatridis 2015). When not properly controlled by the shareholders (i.e. principals), managers may use firm resources to donate to causes which enhance their personal image instead of the company’s reputational capital (Navarro 1988; Amran et al. 2007; Cowan et al. 2013). These agency costs may outbalance potential benefits of CP and may lead to an overall negative association between CP and CFP.\n\nHowever, the existence of a positive or a negative relationship between CP and CFP does not have to be exclusive. Wang et al. (2008) as well as Chen and Lin (2015) proposed and empirically verified an inverted u-shaped relationship. They suggest that negative effects of CP, as implied by agency theory, from a certain point on are greater than the benefits generated by gratifying the stakeholders. As a consequence, the financial net effect of charitable donations for companies is first positive, then levels out, and eventually turns negative (Wang et al. 2008).\n\nWhile various studies have found empirical support for a positive relationship between CP and CFP (Hall and Rieck 1998; Su and He 2010; Tian 2012; Qiu 2013; Iatridis 2015), others have not (Seifert et al. 2003, 2004), and again others have even found negative relationships (Balabanis et al. 1998; Gao et al. 2012). Although the main purpose of this study is not to reaffirm the general link between CP and CFP but to take a closer look at different circumstances and study designs which affect this relationship, it is necessary to establish a starting point of our inquiry. This is why our research question 1 (RQ1) examines the existence of a generally positive relationship between CP and CFP across all study designs integrated within our meta-analysis.\n\n# RQ1: Is there a positive relationship between CP and CFP?\n\n# 2.2 Investigating causality with time-lagged measurements\n\nWhen investigating the relationship between CP and CFP, it is important to keep in mind that a mere statistical association of two variables does not allow for any conclusion about causality (Mitchell and James 2001; Van der Stede 2014). The relationship between CP and CFP could be a result of a causal effect of CFP on CP, i.e. companies with stronger financial performance give more because they can, or of a causal effect of CP on CFP, i.e. positive effects of CP on reputation and employee motivation lead to higher CFP, or both. To find evidence that allows for an inference of causation,\n\nF. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nResearchers can measure variables in a temporal sequence by introducing a time lag. If, for example, CFP is measured 1 year after the corporate donation amount was measured (subsequent measurement), a statistical correlation between the two measures can plausibly be interpreted to imply that CP has an effect on CFP. If both indicators are assessed at the same time (concurrent measurement), on the other hand, no causal relationship can\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
