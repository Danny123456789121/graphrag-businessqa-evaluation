This implies the SMA focus is on helping to develop the organization towards its own sustainable development. However, as sustainable development is a normative societal vision, to help towards achieving this vision, SMA needs an enlarged scope that considers influences from and on the outside as well as impacts of the organization within its boundary (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2017; Schaltegger, 2018). Such an extension of the scope of SMA is also in line with the transformation necessities identified in the sustainability transition literature (Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013; Williams & Robinson, 2020).\n\nAs long as SMA continues to adopt the conventional management accounting assumption of an internal scope it reinforces the view that internal optimisations will suffice to meet external expectations about contributions towards sustainability. SMA based on the internal scope assumption of management accounting results in managers being ill-informed about sustainability relevant issues, with the effect that SMA does not support broader transformational change. If SMA is to contribute to the societal vision of sustainable development it should be designed with the purpose of supporting managers in creating external contributions of organizations to sustainable development of markets, society and the natural environment. The question of whether planned and achieved sustainability improvements are sufficient to achieve effective contributions to sustainable development at the global macro-level, therefore, needs to be brought into the focus of SMA.\n\nThe next section proposes a new assumption and goal for SMA that addresses the identified multi-level links between SMA and sustainable development for which the literature review has been a catalyst.\n\n# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\n\n# 493\n\n# FIGURE 3\n\nCAT framework for SMA [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\n\n# CAT framework to organize SMA\n\nThe embeddedness of organizations in meso- and macro-level contexts as well as the inevitable influence of organizations on these levels requires management to be better informed with SMA about how situational topics and mechanisms can intrigue sustainability management of the business, and how the effectiveness of the organization’s contributions to sustainability transformations can be measured and communicated.\n\nTo conceptualise the analysis, a framework was abductively developed in a continuous iteration between the data (the reviewed articles) and the theory that informed the analysis from a multilevel perspective. Based on analysis of the existing literature, and by referring to the social mechanisms framework that distinguishes situational (context), action-formation and transformational mechanisms, a CAT (context, action, transformation) framework to reorganize SMA is proposed as follows:\n\n1. Context: Performance is achievement in relation to certain expectations or goals. Managing performance therefore requires being informed about external requirements and expectations. To contribute to sustainable development first requires an understanding of scientific and societal requirements from the macro-level of analysis (e.g., planetary boundaries) as well as stakeholder expectations expressed in regulations, guidelines and standards at the meso-level (left side of Figure 3). As sustainability is a complex, multifaceted vision with many different goals a structured account is needed.\n2. Action: SMA for the company’s actions is what current research literature has mostly focused on. The key question to be answered by SMA for management actions includes what social and environmental activities are conducted with what immediate economic (e.g., costs of investment in energy saving devices), social (e.g., safety improvement at working place) and environmental implications (e.g., energy savings achieved and carbon emissions reduced)?\n\n14682370, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijmr.12288, Wiley Online Library on [23/12/2024].

While internal actions in the organization have been the main focus of most SMA methods so far, the existing approaches have considered context with regard to the expectations of the own actions only partially. Implementation of material flow cost accounting in line with the ISO 14051 standard (Kokubu & Kitada, 2015), or developing carbon accounting with regard to regulatory requirements of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, have been investigated (Ascui & Lovell, 2012). Explicit links to whether planetary boundary conditions or UN SDGs are considered (e.g., in MFCA) and what consequences need to be drawn for benchmarking, goal setting, etc. has only more recently been addressed as a requirement and needs further development of SMA with regard to creating contributions to sustainability transformations beyond organizational boundaries.\n\n# c. Transformation\n\nThe assumption that internal improvements in an organization will invariably lead to sustainability, has been questioned in the existing literature (Gray, 2010), but it has not informed research into how SMA could be further developed to ensure effective sustainability contributions beyond the organization. Whether and to what extent the company contributes to societal and scientifically developed environmental goals is, however, crucial information managers need to develop a sustainable business (Hörisch et al., 2014). SMA is therefore challenged to create information to answer the key transformational question, how does the company contribute to sustainable development beyond its organizational boundaries; that is, a sustainable development of supply chains, markets, society and the natural environment? Sustainable entrepreneurship literature suggests that organizations can contribute to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
