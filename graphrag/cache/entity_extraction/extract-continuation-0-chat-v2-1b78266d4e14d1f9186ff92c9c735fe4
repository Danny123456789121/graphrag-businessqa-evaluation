Economics sub-criteria.\n\n# Environment\n\nResults showed the ranking within the Environmental dimension of corporate sustainability are as follows: ENV1 > ENV4 > ENV3 > ENV2 > ENV5, as shown in Figure 11. The highest weight, 0.5321, obtained of sub-criteria within the environment category is initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ENV1). Compliance with environmental regulations (ENV4) reported the second sub-criteria in the row with a weight of 0.4654. Whereas, environmental management and responsibility (ENV3) sub-barrier and commitment, scope, and dissemination of environmental policy (ENV2) are ranked at third and fourth positions, within the environmental sustainability category, presenting a score of 0.3936 and 0.3381, respectively. Finally, environmental cost-saving operations (ENV5) come fifth in the row with a weight of 0.2101. Government regulations have been the primary drivers of a part of corporate sustainability. Literature showed that environmental sustainability provides cost reductions for the businesses, and these reductions are related to the use of energy, raw materials, and water, as well as reducing waste generation. Environmental sustainability improves the company’s reputation for stakeholders and into the market which, in turn, eases acquiring new customers prone to environmental issues. The incorporation of EMS by companies leads to CO2 emission reductions as well as a reduction in pollution [103,104].\n\n# Social\n\nFigure 12 shows the outcomes, ranking the sub-criteria as follows: SOC1 > SOC4 > SOC5 > SOC2 > SOC3. The highest sub-attribute of social criteria is the commitment to societal development (SOC1) with a weight of 0.5464. Training employees through in-house programs (SOC4) is ranked at the second position, presenting a score of 0.4821. Companies must train their personnel to work in an integrated way. Additionally, companies must use integration between auditing services and administration support for building stronger relationships with stakeholders. These relations promote efficiency, may save resources, and provide assertiveness amongst personnel.\n\n# Environmental cost saving operations-ENVS\n\n0.2101\n\n# Commitmcnt and disscmination of cnvironmcntal policy-ENV2\n\n0.3381\n\n# Environmcntal managcmcnt and rcsponsibility-ENV3\n\n0.3936\n\n# Compliance with environmental regulations-ENV4\n\n4654\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n# Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-TNVI\n\n0.532\n\n# Environmental cost saving operations-ENVS\n\n0.2101\n\n# Commitmcnt and disscmination of cnvironmcntal policy-ENV2\n\n0.3381\n\n# Environmcntal managcmcnt and rcsponsibility-ENV3\n\n0.3936\n\n# Compliance with environmental regulations-ENV4\n\n4654\n\n# Social:\n\nFigure 12 shows the outcomes, ranking the sub-criteria as follows: SOC1>SOC4>SOC5>SOC2>SOC3.

Training employees through in-house programs (SOC4) is ranked at the second position, presenting a score of 0.4821. Companies must train their personnel to work in an integrated way. Additionally, companies must use integration between auditing services and administration support for building stronger relationships with stakeholders.

Human resources (HR) have a crucial role in the implementation of sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. Labor relations and with society (SOC2) as well as diversity and equity, supplier management, and resolution of society’s demands (SOC3) are ranked into the fourth and fifth positions, presenting scores of 0.3241 and 0.2146, respectively. Here, we see a strong relationship with suppliers, which emphasizes the need for developing an integrative decision support program for managing the supply chain, taking into account the stakeholders that strategically improve the company’s production processes and balance the supplier sustainability system.\n\n# Natural Environment and Climate:\n\nUnder the natural environment and climate change category, results showed in Figure 13 allowed the identification of the following ranking: NEC1>NEC3>NEC2>NEC4. Commitment to climate change (NEC1) is presented as the highest score within sustainability by companies [105].
