First, the studies quantitatively examined the relationship between CSP and CFP. The reported effect size did not have to be a Pearsons’ product-moment correlation r, but could also be a t-test statistic or effect size t d (both t and d can be transformed to r; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Second, the studies were concerned with at least one aspect of a firm’s economic performance, as circumscribed by the definition of CFP. For the purpose of this study, CFP was defined as a company’s financial viability, or the extent to which a company achieves its economic goals (Price and Mueller 1986; Venkatraman and Ramanujam 1986). Third, all retrieved studies were double-checked for conformance to Wood’s (1991a) definition of CSP (see Introduction above). Wood’s (1991a) now classic definition is used because it is one of the most influential, helpful, parsimonious, and yet comprehensive conceptualizations of CSP. If the particular variable could not be classified.\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n# 24(3)\n\nas an example belonging to one of the nine subcategories of Wood’s model, the study was excluded. In addition, unclear reporting of empirical results was also a reason for exclusion.\n\nStudies of environmental management and CFP are included in the meta-analysis for several reasons. First, several studies, especially earlier ones, use environmental performance as a proxy for social responsibility. Second, stakeholder proxies, such as environmental interest groups and government agencies, may in fact give voice to, or claim a social ‘stake’ for, non-human nature (Starik 1995). Lastly, the business community tends to regard social responsibility as including both social and environmental performance (for example, Willums 1999). Still, the argument can be made that the literature on CSP differs from the one on corporate environmental performance in various aspects. To investigate differences between social and environmental performance, the entire set (k = number of effect sizes integrated = 388) is disaggregated into purely social performance measures only (that is, excluding all environmental performance measures; k = 249) and environmental measures only (k = 139).\n\n# Characteristics of Primary Studies\n\nThe most important study characteristics, such as author(s), date of study, study sample size N i, observed r or transformed and/or partially corrected r (that is, corrected for dichotomization and unequal sample sizes in the two groups compared in a t-test), number of correlations per study, operationalization of CSP and CFP, and estimates of reliability are listed in Appendix A.\n\nReliability is traditionally defined as the ratio of true-score variance to observed-score variance (Traub 1994). Thus, classical measurement theory is concerned with the correspondence between observed scores and true scores. Some of the reliability coefficients used in this study are in the tradition of classical reliability theory, such as coefficient alpha. Sometimes, however, it becomes necessary to count not only variation due to item sampling, but also day-to-day variation in scores as measurement error. In classical theory, one can accomplish this task by using an alternate-forms coefficient of reliability. Generalizability theory is less restrictive in its assumptions than classical theory (Cronbach et al. 1972). The coefficient of generalizability reflects the degree to which observed scores (of CSP or CFP in this case) allow for generalization about a firm’s behaviour in a defined universe of situations (Cronbach et al. 1972; Shavelson et al. 1989). Generalizability is estimated through ‘alternate-forms’ correlations between different CSP, and CFP, measures.\n\nThe present study estimates reliability by including coefficients of generalizability (76 percent), stability (4 percent), internal reliability (8 percent), and inter-rater reliability (12 percent). Both stability and generalizability coefficients are underestimates of reliability (Orlitzky 1998). Because of the predominance of coefficients of stability and generalizability, the meta-analysis provides conservative estimates (that is, lower-bound estimates) of the reliability of the CSP or CFP measurement instrument.\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nIn addition to listing the reliabilities of both constructs, Appendix A shows the great variety of study contexts and operationalizations of both constructs. From the vantage point of generating cumulative knowledge, multiple operationism is an advantage because it helps determine whether a ‘true’ relationship exists in different industry contexts with different operationalizations of the two focal constructs (Cook and Campbell 1979; Cooper 1989; Webb et al. 1981). In past meta-analyses, integrated studies often contained broad meta-constructs as well, such as job or organizational performance, operationalized in many different ways (for example, Gooding and Wagner 1985; Ketchen et al. 1997; Roth et al. 1996; Wagner and Gooding 1987). During data collection, the inclusion criteria for relevance (see above) served as constant checks on the operationalizations’ conformance to the broad conceptual definitions of CSP and CFP.\n\nEmpirically, the standard deviation of ρ serves as an indicator of cross-study heterogeneity. The percentage of cross-study variance explained by artefacts is another indicator of the degree of cross-study generalizability (Hunter and Schmidt\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
