ER also includes the roles of “third parties” such as arbitrators, policymakers, government agencies and other stakeholders (Bamber et al., 2021). Fairness, accuracy, transparency and trust are important aspects of ER. In this context, what, then, are the implications and uses of ChatGPT and other generative AI-driven tools for ER?\n\nChatGPT-like innovations use generative AI and LLM employing ML technologies to deliver human-like conversational interactions. These disruptive AI-driven tools have precipitated much discussion and emerging research agendas regarding the implications for managers and those trying to represent, educate and train workers (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Such disruptions have sparked interest in how such AI-driven tools may affect workplaces (Milanez, 2023) and ER stakeholders (Ioakimidis & Maglajlic, 2023; Zu, 2023) and HRM (Korzynski et al., 2023).\n\nAs developments in this domain are moving rapidly, we highlight some initial implications of such AI-driven tools for ER. Stakeholders can deploy these innovations to:\n\n- generate possible scenarios and personalised and individualised training solutions for employees to address the current and foreseeable skill gaps created by AI applications (Tcharnetsky & Vogt, 2023).\n- produce narratives that may enhance employees' education and training.\n- automate some tasks that involve language processing, such as reviewing employment-related contracts, and other documents.\n- create draft workplace communications and rules regarding protocols and safety.\n- analyse and share HR analytic data.\n- synthesise employees' voice channels, suggestions, feedback, and insights.\n\n# Research Questions\n\n- What are the potential privacy and security risks associated with using ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations mitigate these risks?\n- What are the ethical considerations associated with using ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations ensure that the use of ChatGPT is aligned with ethical standards and guidelines?\n- How does the use of ChatGPT impact the organizational culture, and how can organizations ensure that ChatGPT aligns with their values and culture?\n- What are the long-term effects of using ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations measure and evaluate these effects?\n\nThis research agenda does not reflect an exhaustive list of research considerations. However, given the present—and impending exponential—adoption of this type of technology in the workplace, these inquiries may illuminate best practices, benefits, risks, and outcomes associated with HRM practices and the impact on employment relations, employee wellbeing and engagement.\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\n• increase awareness of issues around inequality, transparency and legal frameworks.\n\n• spawn opportunities for new analytical, ethics, data science and responsible AI-related jobs.\n\nIn collective bargaining, some negotiators could use these innovations to facilitate their research, claim formulation and other preparations. For example, negotiators could use the ChatGPT-like innovations to help them research cases more widely and quickly than they could otherwise, for instance, to find and assemble precedents, develop arguments, and draft speeches. In addition, union leaders and officials can draw on these innovations to facilitate the recruitment and retention of members, and communications with them. Even though large technology firms' rhetoric may claim that these ChatGPT-like innovations promote empowerment and other advantages, there may also be disadvantages. Such technologies are not a panacea; they also have limitations, potential dark sides and challenges (van Dis et al., 2023). This is especially because employers may have moral and legal obligations and responsibilities towards employees, who employers should consult before making major changes to employment conditions. These obligations and responsibilities vary in different national and regional contexts (On the Australian context, see Clayton UTZ, 2023).\n\nFor example, using these innovations in inappropriate ways may:\n\n- precipitate greater levels of job insecurity and increased job precarity, which often becomes a latent or explicit issue in ER disputes.\n- lead to more unfairness in workplaces, especially as the users may not understand these innovations' limitations.\n- produce harmful, misleading or wrong outputs that can damage trust in employers, unions and managers' reputations.\n- create legal problems when used for ER decisions when there may be input mistakes or inaccurate output.\n- raise ethical and legal issues related to intellectual property, privacy, consent, covert surveillance and accountability of employees' personal data.\n- cause complex consent issues, for instance, due to the lack of transparency; for instance, if stakeholders were subsequently to use employees' data for reasons other than those specified in the original consent, especially if data enters an LLM's database.\n- not always be fully in tune with the context, intent, nuance or tone of the user or the task and therefore produce inaccurate narratives.\n- generate wrong, inappropriate or irrelevant responses.\n- create new jobs that may require high-tech skills or be in the “gig economy”; most such jobs are not currently covered by unions.\n- foster employees' psychological distress and decrease their sense of wellbeing.\n\nTherefore, these innovations should be used thoughtfully and responsibly by considering the potential advantages and disadvantages for different audiences, stakeholders and scenarios. ChatGPT-like innovations should involve human oversight and intervention, using practices such as verification and independent moderation of the input data, process technologies and output selection bases. This is necessary to ensure quality, accuracy, compliance with the law, collective agreements/contracts, and ethical behaviour. Employees are likely to be alienated if they infer that they are being managed or represented by these technologies or algorithms. We hypothesise that most employees prefer to be managed and represented by people, with whom they can discuss matters, rather than by impersonal technologies or algorithms.\n\nGiven that many ChatGPT-like innovations will be developed further, affecting ER in varied ways, we encourage ER stakeholders to facilitate employees having a voice in how technologies are used.
