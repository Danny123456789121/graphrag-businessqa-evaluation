For example, the parents of cost (Eco1) are (Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values in matrix Aeco. The variance values for the ranked nodes were defined by the sum of variances of the DEMATEL questionnaire responses for Eco1 in Table 11.\n\n**Table 11. Means and variances of effects of Eco2, Eco3 on Eco1.**\n|Parameters|How Much Does (Eco2) Influence (Eco1)?|How Much Does (Eco3) Influence Cost (Eco1)?|\n|---|---|---|\n|Mean|3.33|3.33|\n|Variance|0.333|0.333|\n\nThe overall final target node is the supplier selection variable. This node provides a probability statement about whether the supplier should be selected, conditioned on environmental, social and economic nodes and considering their weights.\n\nThe supplier selection node is defined by a Boolean variable for which a probability measures whether a criterion is met (True) or not (False). The Boolean expression is (0.618 * Eco + 0.297 * Env + 0.086 * Soc > 0.6, “True”, “False”) based on the importance given to these criteria by the decision-makers according to the AHP results (Table 3). This means that the global performance of the supplier should be at least 60% but can be determined by the company. The value of 60% was determined according to the decision-makers and it can be unique according to specific company requirements.\n\nAfter the parameters of all nodes are determined, the initial BN model is evaluated using “AgenaRisk” software as shown in Figure 3. In this initial BN, the decision regarding the selection of the supplier is approximately 71% false and 29% true. This means that if this supplier is selected, there is only a 29% probability that they will actually be the best overall performer.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n# Supplier selection\n\n|False|70.6565|\n|---|---|\n|True|29.344%|\n\n|Soc| | |Very Low|T97I7K| | |Env|Very Low|Eco|T06373|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | | |Low|20.283%| | |Very Low|T9.6657| |20.333%|\n| | | |Medium|20.001%| | |Low| |Low|24.032%|\n| | | |High|20.283%| | |Medium|20.004%|Medium|30.662%|\n| | | |Very High -|19.717%| |High -| |20.333%|Very High|24.032%|\n| | |Soc2| |Envl| |Env2| | |Ecoz| |\n|Soc3|Very Low|20%|Very Low|T9373%|Very Low|20x| | | | |\n|Very Low|203|Low| |Low| |20%| | | | |\n| |Medium|20%| |Medium|20%|Medium|20%| | | |\n| |High|20%| |Very High-|20%|Very High -|20%| | | |\n\n# 3.4. Completing a Sensitivity Analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis provides evidence for the robustness of the solution. The objective is to verify how much each criterion is affected by the variation in the other criteria or parameters. This may also help to determine the most influential criteria. Sensitivity analysis was proposed using a tornado graph.\n\nThe length of the bars in the tornado graphs can be considered as the measure of the impact of sensitivity variables on the target variable and the sensitivity of this variable on other variables.\n\nFor example, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the supplier evaluation node with respect to economic, environmental and social aspects. The probability of supplier selection being true and false is 29% and 71%, respectively, as illustrated in the tornado graphs in Figures 4 and 5. From these figures, we see that the probability of selecting a supplier is more sensitive to the changes in the value of the economic dimension and least sensitive to changes in social dimension values. We also carried out the sensitivity analysis regarding the criteria. For example, if the overall Eco dimension is “Very High”, given that the criteria parents remain equal, then the probability of selection of this supplier is 93.3%, meeting the performance expectations. In Figure 5, we see that if Eco = very low, then it is 100% likely not to be selected (this is also true in Figure 4, which shows a 0.000 probability of supplier selection = True when Eco = very low).\n\n# Tornado graph for p(Supplier selection = True)\n\nCurrent value p(Supplier selection = True) F 0.293\n\n|P(Eco = Very Low}|0.000| | |0.933|P(Eco =Very High}|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|P(Env = Very Low}| |0.079|0.546| |P(Env = Very High}|\n|P(Soc = Very Low}| |0.234|0.356| |P(Soc =Very High}|\n\n#\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>EVENT<|>The supplier selection event is a decision-making process that evaluates whether a supplier meets certain criteria based on environmental, social, and economic factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENA RISK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AgenaRisk is software used for evaluating Bayesian networks, particularly in the context of decision-making processes like supplier selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMATEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DEMATEL is a method used to analyze and visualize the relationships among criteria in decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 11<|>EVENT<|>Table 11 presents the means and variances of the effects of Eco2 and Eco3 on Eco1, which are part of the supplier selection criteria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Tornado Graph<|>EVENT<|>The tornado graph is a visual representation used in sensitivity analysis to show the impact of different criteria on the supplier selection decision.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECO<|>PERSON<|>Eco refers to the economic dimension considered in the supplier selection process, influencing the decision based on its value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENV<|>PERSON<|>Env refers to the environmental dimension considered in the supplier selection process, influencing the decision based on its value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOC<|>PERSON<|>Soc refers to the social dimension considered in the supplier selection process, influencing the decision based on its value.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>AGENA RISK<|>AgenaRisk software is used to evaluate the supplier selection process through Bayesian networks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>DEMATEL<|>DEMATEL is used to define the weights of criteria in the supplier selection process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>TABLE 11<|>Table 11 provides data that influences the supplier selection decision based on Eco2 and Eco3<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>Tornado Graph<|>The tornado graph visually represents the sensitivity analysis related to the supplier selection decision<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>ECO<|>The economic dimension (Eco) is a critical factor in determining the supplier selection outcome<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>ENV<|>The environmental dimension (Env) is a critical factor in determining the supplier selection outcome<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER SELECTION<|>SOC<|>The social dimension (Soc) is a critical factor in determining the supplier selection outcome<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
