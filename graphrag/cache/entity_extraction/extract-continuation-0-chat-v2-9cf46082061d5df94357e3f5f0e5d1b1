In any academic field, however, an important part of conceptually understanding a phenomenon will result from making sense of how the phenomenon causally influences other phenomena.\n\nSecond, as the main aim of this study is to develop the concept of strategic CSR based on the body of causal knowledge and empirical evidence already available at this time, we are not overly worried about these claims being precluded from empirical testing. Not only do we provide a comprehensive meta-analytic test of all the mechanisms that we use to identify the causally most relevant properties of CSR in explaining CFP, but all causal claims involved in our conceptualization of Strategic CSR are open to later empirical scrutiny should there be substantive or methodological reasons for empirically testing these claims further.\n\nFinally, Goertz (2006, p. 65–67) acknowledges that hardwiring causal knowledge into our theoretical conceptualization of social reality may not only increase our theoretical understanding of social reality, but may also be problematic precisely because conceptual knowledge is assumed rather than tested in any particular empirical research project. He proposes a pragmatic approach to this problem, however, by arguing that hardwiring available causal knowledge into our conceptualizations should be avoided as much as possible when conceptualizing the explandum (or dependent variable) in research. This is because in explaining a phenomenon,\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

These concerns are mitigated, however, when conceptualizing the explanans (or explanatory variable) in research, because in that case we would be wise to use all currently available causal knowledge in our concepts and theories in order to develop and test novel theories and predictions. Note that our evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR treats it as an explanans in explaining CFP, while we do not make any explanatory claim in this study about Strategic CSR as an explanandum. In sum, we believe our strategy to conceptualize Strategic CSR based on available knowledge of how it causally affects CFP not only increases our theoretical understanding of Strategic CSR, but also our understanding of how Strategic CSR differs from CSR more generally.\n\niii A complete overview of the included studies in our meta-analysis can be offered upon request.\n\niv The partial correlation coefficients were calculated by using the t-statistic reported in the primary studies. If the t-statistic was not reported, we approximated it using the regression coefficient and the standard errors. The formula used to calculate partial correlation is: (t2 / (t2 + df)), where t is the t-statistic and df is degrees of freedom. Note that this will always produce a positive number, so it is necessary to convert it to a negative number if the regression coefficient is negative (Greene, 2008).\n\nv As a separate robustness check, we also ran our MASEM analyses again without the survey data-based effect sizes. All our findings are robust against this exclusion.\n\nvi For the Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method, we used the left-of-mean (L) estimator (Kepes, Banks, McDaniel & Whetzel, 2012). We then calculated the absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size to the left of the trim and fill-adjusted observed mean effect size (Harrison et al., 2017). For the CMA, we calculated the weighted mean correlation of the 10 percent most precise (i.e., largest samples) in our meta-analysis (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009; Harrison et al., 2017). Again, we calculated the absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size, but now to the most precise 10 percent of samples (Harrison et al., 2017). For the moderate selection model, we followed the Hedges and Vevea (2005) technique, since several of our meta-analytic relationships present a k lower than 100. We identified the specific weights and probability value cut-off points for our sample based on Vevea and Woods (2005). The absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size was calculated to the moderate selection model adjusted mean effect size (Harrison et al., 2017).\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We then calculated the average degree of change across these three publication bias tests (Harrison et al., 2017), which was equal to 0.01. We also computed Rosenthal’s Fail-Safe N values: N = 829,029 and 436,029 for the r- and rxy.z-based correlation results respectively. These numbers represent the number of missing studies averaging a z-value of zero that should be added to our sample to make the combined effect size statistically insignificant.\n\nvii The online appendix is available at: https://figshare.com/s/088ee166da7c37693b0b\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
