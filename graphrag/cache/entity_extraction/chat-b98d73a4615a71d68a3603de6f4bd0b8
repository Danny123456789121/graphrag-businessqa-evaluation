To begin with, we find that ESs are positive in the earlier period and have become smaller in terms of absolute value with alternating signs as time passes. When the idea of SRI was relatively new, investors seemed to be able to earn excess returns by incorporating SRI elements in their portfolio. However, the excess return opportunity may have decreased over time and researchers seem to find a smaller impact of SRI since spurious differences between SRI and conventional investment performances are eliminated by the improvement in sampling and methodology and this pattern is by and large consistent with a dialectical development of theories. We also find that papers with sample periods containing economic crisis tend to show a lower ES, as expected.\n\nAs for publication status, we find no evidence of publication bias, so we can interpret our results without this complication caused by the publication status of papers. An interesting finding is that better quality journals show relatively smaller AESs than lower quality journals, suggesting that rigorous review processes make papers tone down unwarranted excessive claims.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nWhereas the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted in academia, researchers from industry are more interested in developing a logical backup for industry practices such as active portfolio management and finding the profit potential in SRI. Owing to this difference in research incentives and environment, academic researchers tend to uncover smaller AESs than industry professionals. However, there is no systematic difference in SRI performance among scholars in different disciplines.\n\nObviously, the chance of having spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds becomes higher as the two groups are more different. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the AESs are bigger when SRI samples are compared with market indexes than when SRI samples are compared with conventional portfolios. And, the AESs are smaller when SRI indexes, not SRI portfolios, are compared with conventional indexes.\n\nStudies comparing SRI portfolios with market portfolios rather than other conventional portfolios tend to show lower ESs. In addition, studies examining negative screening tend to generate smaller ESs than those with positive screening. SRI portfolios and negative screening portfolios seem to sacrifice a diversification benefit, compared with market portfolio and positive screening portfolios, respectively.\n\nCultural background seems to be an important factor, since domestic SRI funds tend to show higher ESs than international funds. Finally, studies of mutual fund samples show smaller ESs than those of author-composed portfolios. This is largely consistent with capital market efficiency and evidence on mutual fund performances that managed funds rarely beat the market. This result is also related to the fact that mutual fund performance incorporates all costs such as fees, transaction costs, and management compensation, whereas a comparison of composed portfolios in general does not fully take this aspect into account.\n\nWe investigate three methodological issues: variable adjustment, the refining benchmark model, and matching procedure. Regarding variable adjustment, our results indicate that any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios can be reduced by using risk-adjusted performance measures, value-weighting schemes, and more accurate variables. Refining benchmark models is related to the issue of return-generating models. Papers using multi-factor models seem to report a lower SRI impact than those using a single-index model. As for matching procedure, papers employing a matching strategy between SRI and control portfolios tend to show smaller AESs. These results suggest that researchers must try to secure similarities as much as possible to minimize a spurious performance difference between SRI and control portfolios. Researchers also have to avoid making various methodological errors.\n\nThere is a limitation to drawing a universal conclusion on the impact of SRI upon investment performance, since our empirical result is based only on the US market. However, the findings in this article can be a valid starting point for future research. A natural candidate for future research is an inter-country or inter-\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n29\n\nC.-S. Kim\n\nregional comparison of SRI performances. Although data collection and reﬁnement and the interpretation of results based on different cultural backgrounds would be quite challenging, such a study will deﬁnitely enhance our understanding of this important issue.\n\nAs for methodology, it is true that meta-analysis is a good tool to summarize many papers on the same subject. However, a wide variety of differences among selected papers in terms of sampling and methodology is a signiﬁcant challenge when performing a sound meta-analysis. Theoretically, the SRI performance can be different depending on the research period, crisis versus normal times, security types, portfolio diversiﬁcation, social and cultural backgrounds, domestic versus international investments, and so forth. However, even though there would be only one true level of performance difference between SRI and control portfolios caused by a particular factor, researchers may ﬁnd a dissimilar performance difference if they use different research methodologies. Therefore, future research should be able to separate out more clearly a true SRI impact and the variation in observed SRI performance caused by differences in the research methodologies employed.\n\n# References\n\nAdamsson, H., and A.
