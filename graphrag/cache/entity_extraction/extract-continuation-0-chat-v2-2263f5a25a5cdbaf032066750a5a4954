Despite the importance of the analysis provided by Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013), their study has three major limitations. First, the sample of studies on which Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) based their examination is far from comprehensively encompassing the available empirical evidence, which is somewhat contradictory to the idea of systematic research syntheses (Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer, 2008). While their meta-analysis covered 37 studies (71 effect sizes) yielding a cumulative sample size of 22,869 observations, we draw in our main analysis on a sample of 149 studies (245 effect sizes) yielding a total of 201,511 observations. Hence, our analysis is based on much more fuller representation of available research allowing better estimation results and thus more powerful, valid, and generalizable insights.\n\nSecond, Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) did not account for the issue of causality. Their study provided only a one-sided analysis, as it was exclusively based on studies that considered the causal direction of CEP on CFP. Although the majority of studies have focused on this direction of effect, the reverse direction, theoretically underpinned by the slack resources hypothesis, has also been tested and supported empirically (e.g., Earnhart & Lizal, 2006; Konar & Cohen, 2000). Our approach enables a fine-grained analysis of the interplay of the dimensions of the focal constructs and the direction of causality. Finally, we complement our main analysis, which is based on bivariate correlations, with a meta-analysis based on partial correlations. This serves as a kind of robustness test and allows us to examine a broad set of methodological artifacts that may account for the variation in the results of previous studies. More specifically, we examine the type of sample used in the primary studies, the degree to which particular control variables were applied, the (non-) controlling for possible endogeneity, and the timing of research. In sum, the main contribution of our paper is to consolidate the mixed empirical findings and to place the research on the CEP–CFP link on solid ground from which avenues for further research can be laid out.\n\nAfter having discussed existing reviews and meta-analyses in order to provide the rationale for our study, we continue with pre-\n\nAnother meta-analysis of CEP–CFP studies has been provided by Albertini (2013). However, this study is subject to similar limitations. First, this meta-analysis build upon a sample of 52 studies yielding a total of 62,943 observations. While this exceeds the basis of the study of Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) it is still far away from what we found to be the empirical evidence at hand. Second, although Albertini (2013) itself mentioned the problem of “green-washing”, her analysis also included studies that examined the relationship between corporate environmental disclosure and CFP. Several studies have shown that environmental disclosure cannot be equated with environmental performance, neither with.\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al.

Then we describe the study collection process, the coding of the studies, and the meta-analytic procedures. After that, we present our findings and discuss the implications. Finally, we note the limitations of our analysis and describe possible directions for further research.\n\n# Theoretical background and hypotheses\n\nExtending back to the 1960s, “when a general public awareness of businesses’ environmental pressures emerged” (Blanco et al., 2009, p. 464), research on the relationship between CEP and CFP has yielded a myriad of empirical studies. In essence, the research stream centered around two fundamental issues. One refers to the manifestation of the relationship itself (i.e., whether there is a positive, negative, or neutral relationship between both constructs). The second issue refers to the direction of causality (i.e., whether CEP influences CFP, either positively or negatively, whether CFP influences CEP, either positively or negatively, or whether there is a reciprocal or bidirectional relationship) (Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Schreck, 2011). Several theoretical arguments have been proposed for each of the hypothetical forms of the focal relationship (e.g., Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Salzmann et al., 2005). In the following we briefly review the most important theoretical approaches and present the hypotheses we seek to test.\n\n# CEP influences CFP\n\nTraditional economic reasoning suggests a negative impact of CEP on CFP. Proponents of the trade-off theory, such as Levitt (1958) or Friedman (1970), argued that environmental activities withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance, as the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs (Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Waddock & Graves, 1997). Based on (short-term) shareholder maximization logic, this perspective contends that environmental activities conflict with firms’ primary objectives, as the voluntary reduction of environmental impacts is considered philanthropy, which incurs social costs and contravenes profit-maximization (King & Lenox, 2002). These neoclassical positions have been increasingly challenged by various scholars who\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Dixon-Fowler et al.
