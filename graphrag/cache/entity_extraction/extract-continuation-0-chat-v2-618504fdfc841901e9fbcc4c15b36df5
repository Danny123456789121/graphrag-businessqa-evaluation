The value of pj indicates the direct and indirect effects of all other criteria on criterion j. Thus, when j = i, the sum (qi + p) yields an index representing the total effects on and by criterion i. In other words, (qi + p) represents the prominence (degree of importance) that criterion i has in the system of criteria. The difference (qi − p) indicates the net effect that criterion ci has on the system. When (qi − p) is positive, criterion ci is a net causer, and when (qi − p) is negative, criterion i is a net receiver.\n\n# Step 5: Producing causal and effect diagram.\n\nThe threshold value μ is computed by averaging the elements in matrix F in order to eliminate some minor effect relationships amongst factors in matrix F (see expression (9)):\n\nμ = ∑n∑in j[Fij] / L (9)\n\nwhere L is the total number of elements in the matrix F. The values of elements in matrix F are set to zero if their values are less than μ. That is, no influence is assumed with other criteria when values are less than μ. Finally, the network relationship map is determined by mapping the dataset of (q + p, q − p), where the horizontal axis (q + p) is made by adding q to p, and the vertical axis (q − p) is made by subtracting q from p.\n\nWe apply these steps to the case study. Xk represents the data gathered from the three decision-makers. The average matrix Aeco for economic criteria was established by using Equation (4).\n\nAeco =\n\n= [0, 0.667, 1]\n\n= [3.33, 0, 0]\n\n= [3.33, 0, 0]\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n11 of 23\n\nThe normalized initial direct relation matrix Reco was calculated using Equation (5):\n\nReco =\n                           \n    0     0.111     0.15   \n                           \n  0.50       0        0    \n                           \n                           \n0.50       0        0\n\nThe total relation matrix Feco is used for constructing a causal graph for a BN. The threshold value μ = 0.219 is defined. The values that were greater than μ = 0.219 represent the direct relation links between criteria. For example, the value of REco21 (0.571) > μ (0.219), the arrow in the causal map, is drawn from Eco2 to Eco1. Eco3 directly influences Eco1 as Reco31 (0.571) > μ (0.219). The total relation matrix Feco was calculated using Equation (3).\n\nFeco =\n                               \n  0.143     0.114     0.171    \n                               \n  0.571     0.057     0.085    \n                               \n                               \n0.571     0.057     0.085\n\nThe sums of rows and columns of matrix Feco were calculated by using Equations (7) and (8) as summarized in Table 4.\n\n**Table 4.

Cost (Eco1) is the most prominent (important) evaluation criterion with the largest (q + p) value = 1.714, whereas quality of product (Eco2) is the least important criterion with the smallest (q + p) value = 0.943. From the (q + p) values, the criteria prioritization is Eco1 > Eco3 > Eco2, confirming the AHP results.\n\nUsing the net effect (q − p) values, the criteria are divided into cause groups with positive (q − p) values and effect groups with negative (q − p) values. In this study, the Eco3 and Eco2 are considered as net cause, having the (q − p) values of 0.486 and 0.371, respectively. In the effect group, cost (Eco1) is classified as a net receiver, with a (q − p) value of −0.857.\n\nThe same process is repeated in order to obtain the cause and effect relationships among the environmental and social criteria as shown in Tables 5 and 6.\n\n**Table 5.
