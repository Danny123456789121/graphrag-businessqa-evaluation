Future research should prioritize an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from fields such as environmental science, data science, and L&SCM management, to holistically study the potential of AI in fostering a more sustainable L&SCM management. This includes analyzing the direct impacts on environmental and social sustainability and examining the broader implications for industry practices, policies, and governance structures. The key research questions that emerge are outlined below.\n\n- How can AI facilitate the development of more sustainable supply chain networks?\n- In what ways can AI enhance transparency and traceability within the supply chain to promote sustainability?\n- Can AI play a pivotal role in enhancing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of supply chain operations?\n- How can AI-driven analytics assist in crafting sustainable transportation and logistics strategies?\n\n# EDITORIAL\n\n# How can AI facilitate the design and development of sustainable products and services?\n\n# How can AI assist organizations in fulfilling their corporate social responsibility (CSR) commitments?\n\n# In what ways can AI enhance stakeholder engagement and collaboration to promote sustainability?\n\n# How can AI assist organizations in complying with sustainability-related regulations and policies?\n\n# What role can AI play in enhancing governance structures to promote sustainability in supply chain operations?\n\n# Which sustainability development goals will benefit from adopting AI applications in the L&SCM sector?\n\nInvestigating the ramifications of incorporating AI technologies in enhancing due diligence within the L&SCM sector offers a novel frontier that warrants a detailed exploration of how AI can facilitate risk mitigation, compliance, and transparency. Potential research avenues and critical questions that might shape future scholarly efforts in this area are outlined below.\n\n# How can AI aid in identifying and mitigating risks at various stages of the supply chain?\n\n# To what extent can AI technologies provide predictive insights into potential disruptions and vulnerabilities in the supply chain?\n\n# How can AI streamline and enhance the supplier evaluation process?\n\n# Can AI applications provide more comprehensive insights into supplier performance and reliability?\n\n# How can AI facilitate compliance with ever-evolving regulatory requirements within the supply chain sector?\n\n# Can AI tools assist organizations in maintaining adherence to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards?\n\n# In what ways can AI technologies enhance financial due diligence processes in the L&SCM sector?\n\n# Can AI provide more sophisticated tools for financial analysis and forecasting?\n\n# To what extent can AI technologies provide real-time insights into product journeys and supply chain operations?\n\n# Can AI foster ethical procurement and sourcing practices?\n\nIntegrating AI technologies in the L&SCM sector promises a transformation with several implications. As we forge ahead into this new frontier, the necessity for robust research into the legal, policy, and regulatory landscapes governing this adoption becomes paramount. In an inherently complex and globally interconnected sector, jurisdiction, compliance, and enforcement questions arise as critical areas of study.\n\n# LEVEL 5: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL FRAMEWORKS\n\nAt its core, AI stands apart from previous technological advancements owing to its inherent ability to recommend decisions, adapt based on learning experiences, and progressively enhance interactions based on acquired knowledge (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). This evolutionary process is markedly distinct from earlier technological transitions, primarily focused on altering or replacing manual tasks with automated processes. Moreover, current AI applications like ChatGPT and Bard excel at understanding the nuances of natural language through patterns and sequences and possess a remarkable ability to comprehend and contextually generate text, offering more sophisticated and coherent responses over extended interactions.\n\nTherefore, AI possesses an array of complex layers that redefine its integration into various sectors (Makarius et al., 2020). These complexities can be categorized into various dimensions, including cognitive aspects that relate to the capabilities and limitations of AI systems and relational facets, which encompass the several factors that come into play during the AI adoption process. Furthermore, the structural dimension encapsulates AI's extensive impact on work patterns, organizational structures, the interaction between AI and employees, and regulatory complexity, underscoring the imperative need for ethical considerations and fostering sustainable AI utilization. This transition has precipitated blurred boundaries between human roles and machine functionalities, fostering a paradigm where automated decision-making processes are increasingly intertwined with contextual complexities. Given this backdrop, it becomes apparent that the existing theoretical frameworks may fall short of capturing the depth and breadth of transformations resulting from AI in the L&SCM sector. The disruptions and evolutions caused by AI are profound and unprecedented, often bypassing the boundaries established by traditional theories.\n\nThus, navigating the nuanced landscape created by AI requires the development of a more sophisticated theoretical lens. This lens should be capable of comprehending the multifaceted complexities introduced by AI, offering a dynamic and adaptive blueprint to study and understand the radical shifts occurring in the L&SCM sector. As we stand on the cusp of this transformation, it is incumbent upon us to foster a theoretical approach that resonates with the dynamism and innovation due to AI, thereby facilitating a seamless integration and application of AI into the L&SCM landscape, which will lead to productivity, sustainability, and resilience.\n\n# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L\n\nsynergizing with human expertise. The key research questions that might help with these dimensions are outlined below.\n\n- To what extent can existing theories in the L&SCM sector comprehensively address the implications and integration of AI?\n- What notable gaps and limitations are present in current theories when examining the phenomena of AI integration in the L&SCM sector, and how might these be addressed to foster a deeper understanding?\n- How might synthesizing existing theories and insights from interdisciplinary studies enhance the comprehension and explanation of AI's potential impact on the L&SCM sector?\n- What novel theories can or should be formulated to holistically understand the AI phenomena within the L&SCM sector, and what rationale underpins the necessity for such theoretical development?\n\n# Methodological approaches\n\nThe research issues and agenda presented in the section above clearly suggest that the domain is complex, necessitating the use of several established and emerging methods
