We propose that these four mechanisms are conceptually and empirically distinct and identify four different causally relevant general attributes of Strategic CSR. Because our survey suggests that these four mechanisms are the main mechanisms through which CSR has been documented to affect CFP, we also conjecture that they jointly identify the causally relevant general attributes of the Strategic CSR concept exhaustively. We test this conjecture by introducing a fifth hypothesis predicting that the CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by these four mechanisms.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n# HYPOTHESES/DEVELOPMENT\n\n# The enhanced firm reputation mechanism\n\nOne well-researched empirical mechanism through which CSR has been found to affect CFP involves reputation enhancement. This mechanism captures the strategic benefits of CSR that result from stakeholders perceiving the firm as a more attractive partner to do business with (Boyd, Bergh, & Ketchen, 2010; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Turban and Greening (1997) were among the first to demonstrate this effect empirically, showing that a strong CSR rating increases firm attractiveness to prospective employees. Subsequent research corroborated this finding by uncovering that a firm’s involvement in CSR activities signals organizational norms and values, which influences prospective employees’ perceptions of the working conditions at the firm (Backhaus, Stone, & Heiner, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000), and increases their willingness to be associated with the firm (Jones, Willness, & Madey, 2014).\n\nFirms signal their CSR activities to stakeholders through their advertising or via external “infomediaries” (Carter, 2006; Deephouse & Heugens, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Schuler & Cording, 2006). A CSR activity for which the effect on reputation is particularly well established, for example, is philanthropic donations (Brammer & Millington, 2005; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Lev et al., 2010; Williams & Barrett, 2000). Such CSR activities are strategically useful because they attract attention and evoke positive attributions by stakeholders (Godfrey, 2005; Groza, Pronschinske, & Walker, 2011). Firms are sometimes criticized for using CSR to convey a positive image without making material changes within the firm (Haack, Schoeneborn, & Wickert, 2012; Marquis & Qian, 2014; Wickert, Scherer, & Spence, 2016). For example, firms may use corporate philanthropy symbolically, to divert attention away from potential misconduct or to buy goodwill after being accused of misconduct (Du, 2015; Koehn & Ueng, 2010).\n\nFor the reputation\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Research has also shown that CSR reputations may enhance CFP. Because many customers, for example, are more attracted to and derive more satisfaction from purchasing products or services from CSR firms (Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006; Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001), which increases their purchasing intention (Sen, Bhattacharya, & Korschun, 2006), as well as their willingness to pay premium prices (Homburg, Koschate, & Hoyer, 2005; Marín, Rubio, & Ruiz De Maya, 2012). Investors have also been shown to be more attracted to CSR firms. While investment analysts used to give negative investment recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings in the early nineties, they often perceive CSR as a legitimate and even positive signal of a firm’s future profitability today (Ioannou & Serafeim, 2015). Indeed, share prices often increase after the public announcement of CSR initiatives (Arya & Zhang, 2009; Ramchander, Schwebach, & Staking, 2012). We therefore hypothesize:\n\n# Hypothesis 1:\n\nThe CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by firm reputation: CSR is positively related to firm reputation, and firm reputation is positively related to CFP.\n\n# The stakeholder reciprocation mechanism\n\nA second mechanism involves stakeholder reciprocation. When firms engage in CSR, they take actions that benefit at least certain stakeholder groups (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Stakeholders reciprocate by endorsing the firm, resulting in more cooperative, productive, and enduring relationships (Bosse, Phillips, & Harrison, 2009; Bosse & Coughlan, 2016; Jones, 1995). In contrast to the reputation enhancement mechanism, for this path to operate.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Employees of CSR firms benefit from practices such as fair pay, a safer work environment, and professional development opportunities (El Research has documented various ways in which CSR activities create value for Akremi\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
