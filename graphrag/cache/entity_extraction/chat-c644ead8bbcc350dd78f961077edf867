This is so because person-to-person interactions and brainstorming sessions to generate truly innovative ideas cannot be replicated by AI as its capability is confined primarily to summarizing/analysing massive amounts of data and repackaging them in a generally intelligible format for consumption. As such, considering its potential benefits, instead of blanket rejection of ChatGPT we should embrace it for use in tasks that are repetitive and hence can be automated. In this way, organizations can channel employees' creativity to more challenging and complex activities that cannot be undertaken by sheer manipulation of large data bases. This redirection of focus will result in significant changes to HRM policies and practices. Companies that can successfully redesign, restructure, retool and reskill their workers to relieve employees from more mundane tasks to focus on creative and innovative endeavours will reap the benefits, thereby highlighting the significant role that such changes can play in a firm's competitiveness and a nation's global competitiveness.\n\nIn a report entitled, The Main Resource is the Human, Musser et al. (2023, p. 1), acknowledged that AI “is increasingly understood as a strategic technology that governments seek to promote domestically and constrain for adversaries”. Furthermore, the report went on to conclude that based on a survey of over 410 authors of papers in 20 top AI journals, the consensus is that “talent” is the most important contributor to the “success of their most significant\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\nprojects”, thus highlighting the pivotal role that the attraction, motivation and retention of talent can play in a nation's international competitiveness. Since talent is mobile, this contributes to the global war for talent, a stable subject of research in IHRM.\n\n# 4.1.2 Diversity of perspectives\n\nResearch has shown that while diversity may lead to conflicts and disagreements in the shorter-term, it can contribute to increased creativity as different perspectives (stemming from a member's gender, race/ethnicity, background and so on) can be incorporated in deliberations to arrive at a final decision.\n\nWhile ChatGPT has been trained on massive databases, the reality is the output reflects largely the algorithms that were written predominantly by white males. For one, AI can be racists and sexists as captured in the title of Noble's book, Algorithms of oppression: How search engines reinforce racism, Noble (2018). For example, in early 2018, Google's facial recognition function was found to be more accurate for identifying white men but less so for women, and even less so for African Americans. A report published by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology, prepared by Schwartz et al. (2022), highlights the disturbing incidence of biases against women, people with dark skin tones, older people, the disabled, and people wearing glasses. Algorithms with such built-in biases can result in discriminatory decisions pertaining to hiring/selection, promotion, firing, evaluation of performance, and compensation. In short, under the guise of science, the perpetrators of such biased decisions may defend the so-called objectivity of their actions.\n\nAside from possible biased decisions, it is important to recognize ChatGPT is trained on large datasets. Since most datasets are in English, they can disenfranchise people whose languages are very different from English. This includes East Asian languages, such as Chinese and Japanese as well as the variety of languages used on the African continent. The Chinese are, of course, working on their own ChatGPT-tools. Concerns have been raised that ChatGPT and its equivalents can “bring about a mass extinction of languages. And … more worryingly, would expunge a diversity of ways of thinking and creativity” since language is contextualized in a culture where it is used (Marian, 2023). In short, AI has the possibility of achieving what centuries of colonization have failed to accomplish, namely wiping out cultures and countries that are under-represented in the AI technological race. The impact of cultural diversity on theories, practices and policies of IHRM has been well documented and continues to receive research attention.\n\nA research agenda under this theme includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Identification of biases inherent in algorithms that can discriminate based on select demographic variables and how to reduce/eliminate these biases in all aspects of HRM functions, policies and practices. Studies of this nature have practical and theoretical implications as they can contribute to our understanding of human-technology interactions.\n- A more nuanced understanding of how AI can inhibit diversity, equity and inclusion in the functioning of multi-cultural teams (MCTs). Such findings can contribute to the theoretical literature on MCTs, a staple research topic in IHRM.\n\nIn summary, while I have identified only two broad themes that merit attention from the IHRM perspective, in reality, there are many, many more. As IHRM researchers devoted to the advancement of the field considering current events and most recent developments, we have an obligation to identify and better understand all the factors and aspects of our discipline that are impacted by ChatGPT to minimize the perilous consequences and harness the promises associated with this new technology.\n\n# 4.2 | ChatGPT, EDI and implications for HRM\n\nFang Lee Cooke12 and Charmi Patel20\n\n# 4.2.1 | Introduction\n\nThe growing use of ChatGPT by organisations in an expanding range of functions and activities, including HRM functions and activities (Howlett, 2023), has implications for equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI), especially in employment security, recruitment and selection, performance appraisal and pay.
