Regardless of the applied indicator, signiﬁcantly positive relationships were found for donation dummy (r m = 0.234, k = 3, n = 373, p = 0.078), donation amount (r m = 0.073, k = 17, n = 10,570, p = 0.040), and relative donations (r m = 0.070, k = 14, n = 22,357, p = 0.085). When concurrent relationships are included, the result remains the same. There is no signiﬁcant difference (Q B = 2.93, p = 0.233) and all indicators show signiﬁcantly positive relationships between CP and CFP (r m = 0.095, k = 8, n = 5,095, p = 0.001; r m = 0.152, k = 37, n = 18,537, p < 0.001; and r m = 0.090, k = 36, n = 63,217, p < 0.001, respectively).\n\nRegarding the donation medium included in the donation measure, there was a limitation of the conducted analysis regarding the assessment of corporate volunteering. Unfortunately, there were not enough effect sizes which included volunteering time into their CP measure to calculate a separate effect, maybe because organized volunteering is a rather new trend. Nevertheless, the relationship was found to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the inclusion of in-kind donations in the measurement (Q B = 6.94, p = 0.031). The effect on the relationship, however, was the reverse of our expectations. Donating only cash led to a signiﬁcantly positive relationship (r m = 0.152, k = 7, n = 492, p = 0.001), while including in-kind donations did not yield a positive effect (r m = 0.027, k = 11, n = 9,032, p = 0.176). Adding concurrent relationships to the results supports these findings in showing a significant difference (Q B = 7.84., p = 0.02) and a stronger relationship for only cash.\n\n# 4.3 Methodological moderators\n\nThe results in Table 4 show that the average relationship between CP and subsequent CFP continues to be signiﬁcantly positive if the effect of other variables is partialed.\n\n|r m|k|n|p|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|0.196|23|5,365|< 0.001|\n|0.060|23|19,054|0.001|\n|0.082|26|32,202|0.005|\n|0.083|8|1,098|0.148|\n|0.122|68|82,401|< 0.001|\n|0.066|13|4,448|0.006|\n|0.077|21|9,399|< 0.001|\n|0.055|13|23,901\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CP-CFP<|>EVENT<|>CP-CFP refers to the relationship between Corporate Philanthropy (CP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), indicating a study of their interactions and effects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Philanthropy involves the efforts of companies to contribute to societal goals, often through donations and community engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance measures a company's financial health and profitability, often evaluated through various metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONATION DUMMY<|>EVENT<|>Donation Dummy is a variable used in studies to assess the impact of whether a company engages in charitable donations or not.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONATION AMOUNT<|>EVENT<|>Donation Amount refers to the total monetary contributions made by a corporation to charitable causes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RELATIVE DONATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Relative Donations measure the contributions of a corporation in relation to its size or revenue, providing context to its philanthropic efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IN-KIND DONATIONS<|>EVENT<|>In-Kind Donations are non-monetary contributions made by corporations, such as goods or services, rather than cash.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASH DONATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Cash Donations refer specifically to monetary contributions made by corporations to charitable organizations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Corporate Philanthropy has a significantly positive relationship with Corporate Financial Performance, indicating that philanthropic efforts can enhance financial outcomes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONATION DUMMY<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>The presence of a donation dummy indicates whether a corporation engages in philanthropy, which is directly related to its corporate philanthropy efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONATION AMOUNT<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>The amount of donations made by a corporation is a key aspect of its corporate philanthropy strategy<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RELATIVE DONATIONS<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>Relative donations provide context to corporate philanthropy by comparing contributions to the corporation's overall size<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IN-KIND DONATIONS<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>In-kind donations are a form of corporate philanthropy that involves non-monetary contributions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CASH DONATIONS<|>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY<|>Cash donations are a primary method of corporate philanthropy, directly impacting financial performance<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
