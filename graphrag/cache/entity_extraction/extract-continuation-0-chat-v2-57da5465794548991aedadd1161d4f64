Conclusion\n\nThis study provides some evidence of the Chinese report users’ perceptions on the importance of GRI indicators of sustainability disclosure. Because of the unique cultural and political background that influence companies in China, our results offer significant\n\nrelevance to existing research into China’s corporate sustainability or social responsibility practices and reporting mechanisms. We found that the Chinese concerns on corporate sustainability are partially different from the Western context-based literature, as well as that from the GRI. The national pursuit of sustainability development engaged by the government has an inevitable influence to change and lead corporate stakeholders’ perception of corporate sustainability. The government as a dominance among social actors has a substantial impact on societal acceptance towards corporates, which has gradually embedded in the Chinese culture. We urge future research to consider the political, cultural and policy impact on society’s expectation when analysing the scope and the extent of corporate sustainability reporting in the Chinese context, especially when comparing results again the Western-based studies.\n\nOur study is subjected to the following limitations. Firstly, this study has limited the collection of its data from financial analysts in China who are considered as prime CSD users. It is suggested that future research may include other relevant report users to further enhance the findings. Secondly, respondents’ perceptions may change over time, and hence a follow-up survey may be necessary to measure the response in a long-run. Thirdly, the differences in the perceived importance of CSD in different countries is possible to be linked with the levels of their development. Because of the political system in China, corporate stakeholders’ perceptions may be considerably influenced by state government. Hence, it could be important for future research to address this concern by including multi-national perceptions for comparisons.\n\n# References\n\nAdams, C. and McNicholas, P.
