It would be legally incumbent upon HT organizations to ensure that the stakeholder data that serves as an additional input into the GAI models produces output that creates and does not destroy value. For example, if creating personalized marketing communications at scale, firms will need to ensure that the GAI model is sensitive to customers of various racial and gender backgrounds.\n\nIn addition, given the fact that GAI moves beyond predictive qualities and can act autonomously, it raises many interesting legal questions that may bring into consideration other non-GAI specific laws. One such question pertains to how we assign fault when a product that causes injury incorporates GAI. For example, who can a customer sue if they are “injured” by the hotel’s chatbot or GAI-based recommendation system? Or, if a customer is left stranded at the airport after a GAI tool handling a booking request makes a mistake and the reservation is not correctly completed? As such, injured individuals have begun to test the use of traditional legal theories, such as products liability. One can imagine a hypothetical case whereby a chatbot used by a restaurant to handle customer inquiries about ingredients, and, more specifically, about allergens, provides incorrect allergen information about a particular dish. A customer with a severe allergy to nuts relies on this information and eats the dish, resulting in an allergic reaction with significant damage. The customer files a lawsuit against the restaurant, alleging misrepresentation, negligence, and possibly products liability.\n\nWhile many of these questions have yet to be determined by the courts, they are important to consider for HT operators when deciding on whether to use GAI and what preventive measures should be in place to protect guests and other stakeholders and prevent or minimize value co-destruction (Glaser & Niebla, 2023). Moreover, as far as the customer is concerned, whether the issue has been caused by a GAI system or not, the buck stops with the operator. Thus, companies using GAI need policies to handle these issues and to be ready to take responsibility for any problems caused by their AI systems, whether these systems were developed in-house or leased from a third party. Failure to do so may result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer/stakeholder trust. A case involving Delta Airlines provides evidence of these issues. In 2019, the airline sued a vendor of GAI-based customer service technology, [24]7.ai, for a breach of passenger data. Allegedly, the vendor had a weak password for its systems, which allowed a hacker to access its code and subsequently scrape the names, addresses, and full credit card details of up to 825,000 Delta customers. Delta took all the necessary steps to take care of its customers, including notifying them promptly and paying for free credit monitoring products for affected passengers (O’Neill, 2019). However, the reputational damage caused to the airline, as reflected in negative PR and consumer class action lawsuits, goes beyond the legal issues pertaining to the use of the GAI technology itself and raises larger questions of accountability and legal liability. In this regard, as J. P. I. van der Rest and colleagues (2020) determined, in the context of personalized pricing practices, “we argue that not much is to be expected from the legal system, at least not in the short run” (p. 113), regarding GAI applications by HT firms and implementing minimum standards of behavior. HT firms can mitigate legal challenges by adopting a holistic value creation perspective—such as that offered by the REFLECT model—accounting for the needs and experiences of various stakeholders.\n\n# Ethical Considerations\n\nBeyond the legal aspects of the collection and use of customer (or stakeholder) data, there are important ethical considerations for HT firms that use GAI-based technology. The first issue pertains to privacy, which relates to the question “Who owns and controls the data, and how can it be used?” GAI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, such as browsing history, location data, and social media activity, to generate personalized recommendations or content. For example, AI-powered systems that collect and analyze customer data for creating personalized menus need to ensure that data are collected and used in a transparent, secure, and ethical manner, with clear consent and privacy measures in place. Are customers given the option to opt-out of their data being collected? Can they choose which components of their data they would like to share or how the data will be shared with third-party systems outside of the company collecting the data?\n\nAnother ethical consideration is the potential for GAI systems to perpetuate biases and stereotypes (N. T. Lee et al., 2019). The current GAI systems mostly rely on Western sources with less input from other parts of the world, and hence may lack the necessary diversity of race, gender, ethnicity, age, education, beliefs, and so on. If these systems are trained on biased data, or if their algorithms incorporate biased assumptions, they can produce content that reinforces existing stereotypes or discriminates against certain groups of people, particularly around race, gender, and ethnicity (Pazzanese, 2020). This can be particularly problematic in the HT industry, where such biases can lead to discriminatory practices in hiring, marketing, and customer service. For example, if a hotel’s AI system recommends spa treatments to female customers or golf courses primarily to male customers, or suggests types of cuisine only to customers from specific racial or ethnic backgrounds, it would reinforce harmful stereotypes and exclusionary practices or even perpetuate unhealthy eating practices. This would not only be unethical, but it would also damage the hotel’s reputation and lead to a loss of customers.\n\n# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research\n\nanalyzes\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HT ORGANIZATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HT organizations are businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector that utilize GAI technology to enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GAI refers to Generative Artificial Intelligence, a technology that can create content and make decisions based on data inputs, increasingly used in various industries including hospitality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELTA AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Delta Airlines is a major American airline that faced legal issues related to a data breach involving GAI-based customer service technology.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>24/7.AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>24/7.ai is a vendor of GAI-based customer service technology that was sued by Delta Airlines for a breach of passenger data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMERS<|>PERSON<|>Customers are individuals who interact with HT organizations and are affected by the use of GAI technology in services and products.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDERS<|>PERSON<|>Stakeholders include all parties interested in the operations of HT organizations, including customers, employees, and investors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>O'NEILL, 2019<|>PERSON<|>O'Neill is a reference to a source discussing the data breach incident involving Delta Airlines and its vendor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOMAS, 2023<|>PERSON<|>Lomas is a reference to a source discussing the legal implications of GAI technology in HT organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N.
