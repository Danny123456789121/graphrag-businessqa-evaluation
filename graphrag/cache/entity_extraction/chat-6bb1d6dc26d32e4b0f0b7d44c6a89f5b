(2023) move up to the industry level by “Empowering supply chains with Industry 4.0 technologies to face megatrends.” They leverage focus group interviews to investigate how megatrends impact the supply chain landscape and the role of technology in supporting supply chain alignment. Five supply chain capabilities are identified as prevalent and fitting external contingencies. The study also highlights and compares the potential of I4.0 technologies and their applications in supporting specific supply chain capabilities. This is a paper that should open minds to future research ideas.\n\nFollowing the first three technology-oriented articles in this issue, we continue to work to push more papers into every annual volume of JBL. There is no cap on the number of papers we will publish. If we can get 100 quality papers, we will publish 100 quality papers. The remaining five papers in this final issue are top quality and cover diverse topics, bringing us to 32 citable papers for the year.\n\nFrom the world of transportation, Balthrop et al. (2023) bring us “How do trucking companies respond to announced versus unannounced safety crackdowns? The case of government inspection blitzes.” This paper embraces our ongoing call for policy research (see: Richey & Davis-Sramek, 2022a, 2022b). The authors investigate how motor carriers respond to changes in the likelihood of regulation via inspections. Using a longitudinal dataset, they find that firms with lower compliance costs and higher costs of avoiding inspections improve compliance before and during announced “blitzes.” Small firms with lower avoidance costs tend to avoid announced blitzes, whereas unannounced blitzes result in no changes in compliance or avoidance.\n\nWe also continue to call for work on last-mile delivery. The last mile is where research and reviewers are in short supply. In “You're Driving Me Crazy! How Emotions Elicited by Negative Driver Behaviors Impact Customer Outcomes in Last Mile Delivery,” Masorgo et al. (2023) run a scenario-based experiment examining—who is at the door with a package? As delivery drivers increasingly act as e-tailers' frontline employees via home deliveries, negative driver behaviors increasingly impact customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Driver affiliation is altering the magnitude of customer responses. Results show that the adverse effects of driver-inappropriate behavior on customer outcomes are mediated by anger and that the effects of driver inflexibility are mediated by sadness. Additionally, the negative effect of driver inflexibility on customer outcomes is weaker for outsourced logistics than for private fleet drivers. Driver-inappropriate behavior exhibits similar adverse effects on customer outcomes for both driver affiliations.\n\nThe final three papers examine classic strategic issues of postponement, relationship-based sourcing, and inventory substitution. These issues deserve additional attention as we move through a post-pandemic paradigm shift. In a much-needed study titled “Revisiting postponement: Boundary-crossing problems and tax implications for global supply chains of integrated solutions,” Norrman and Prataviera (2023) examine postponement decision making for global supply chains. This one-to-four case study approach explores decisions, related fiscal and legal implications, and cross-functional integration at a global high-tech enterprise. The authors detail the contextual drivers of increased postponement boundary complexity to illustrate changes in its decision making.\n\nIn “Competitive actions and supply chain relationships: How suppliers' value-diminishing actions affect buyers' procurement decisions,” Hofer et al. (2023) use econometric and panel data-based analysis to span the...\n\n# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L\n\neffects of competitive actions in the context of vertical buyer–supplier relationships, explicitly examining how a supplier firm's value-diminishing competitive actions lead to subsequent reductions in the buyer's procurement allocations and how contextual factors moderate such effects. Findings show that a supplier's value-diminishing actions are associated with decreases in buyer purchases from the supplier, as well as the supplier's downstream vertical relatedness and the degree to which rival suppliers pursue value-diminishing actions moderate this effect.\n\nFinally, Pritchard et al. (2023) examine a classic logistics problem related to fill rates and stockouts. This study is an excellent example of how even our neo-classical expectations from Deming and other JIT and lean experts are no longer generally accepted, nor should they be if we indeed are focused on the customer. In “The impact of stockout-based switching on fill rates,” the authors examine how customer substitution behavior can influence customer service measures. The authors find that item fill rate is primarily a function of the target service level of the focal item and the willingness to switch from an alternate item to the focal item. Category fill rate is influenced by the target service level of both items, with a willingness to switch amplifying their effect. However, the decision tree approach can overestimate the item fill rate when the willingness to substitute from the alternate item increases and accurately predicts category fill rates outside of scenarios with asymmetric substitutability.\n\nWe hope volume 44 of JBL has been informative and impactful. We also hope this perspective editorial helps guide future research and encourages the field to send important work to the journal.
