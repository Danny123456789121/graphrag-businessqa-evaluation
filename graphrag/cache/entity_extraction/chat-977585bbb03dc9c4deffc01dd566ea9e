The aim of the review is to provide a basis for developing new theoretical models to study GAI in different sectors [18]. Understanding the diverse needs of customers is essential for creating value that resonates with them. This is because their subjective evaluation of wants and needs can significantly influence the design and implementation of strategies to meet those needs. In addition to identifying customers’ requirements, research emphasizes the importance of customer involvement in co-creating value [19]. Value co-creation refers to the process of involving various stakeholder groups in the creation of a product or service [20]. To enable this process, organizations must leverage appropriate technologies. This can lead to a better customer experience. Information and communications technology (ICT) has become integral to all aspects of life, allowing businesses to enhance their customer experience. By using GAI, companies can further improve their customer experience and provide personalized services [21]. Due to the increasing number of people using social media platforms, the demand for interactive technology has become more prevalent in every industry. It has led to the emergence of GAI as a leading technology flag bearer.\n\nThis paper takes a multi-disciplinary approach to explore the potential impact of GAI on customers’ experience across various sectors. It reviews the volume and trends of operative outputs related to GAI applications and identifies factors that influence the adoption of GAI by firms. The paper also proposes a conceptual business model for implementing GAI to achieve goals. However, the study is limited by a lack of comprehensiveness and a narrow scope, making it challenging for scholars to identify relevant gaps in understanding the topic.\n\nTo broaden the field’s scope, the research agenda aims to develop new research tools and methods that can enhance the understanding of the various factors influencing the decision-making process and the adoption of GAI. The paper’s main findings suggest that the framework for GAI applications should be interpretive, interactive, and immersive (3I), providing a deeper understanding of the technology’s drivers and outcomes. As GAI applications continue to impact our daily lives, developing a particular framework for sustainable behavior in the future is feasible.\n\nThe paper is organized into several sections. It begins with an exploration of GAI, followed by a discussion of its impact on consumers and content creation, as well as the advantages it offers manufacturers. Best Practices for using GAI in the Customer Experience Journey are presented. The paper also includes a discussion of GAI’s potential for businesses, and its future applications. Next, the practical and industrial implications\n\nTechnologies 2023, 11, 44\n\nof GAI are examined, as well as a policy framework to address its limitations. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the findings.\n\n# 2. Exploration of GAI\n\nGAI is used to create new content such as videos, audio, and text. Recent breakthroughs in this field have the potential to significantly change how we create content. One example of a chatbot that uses GAI is ChatGPT, which can answer questions on the spot. The OpenAI chatbot (ChatGPT), released to the public in November 2022, is regarded as the best. It already had over a million users in just five days [22]. Its creators also posted impressive examples of its output, such as poems and computer code. While the impact of GAI on content creation is still uncertain, some experts in fields such as advertising and education are keeping a close eye on developments in this area.\n\nWhile there are concerns about the impact of GAI and machine learning on various industries, there is also significant potential for these technologies to have a positive impact. In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated potential in a variety of fields, including medical imaging. Aside from the technology, multiple questions must be answered to develop GAI models [23]. For instance, how does it fit into the broader machine learning framework?\n\nAlthough ChatGPT has received a lot of attention recently, it is not the first text-based AI model to generate interest. Google’s BERT and OpenAI’s GPT-3 have been released to some fanfare in the past couple of years. Despite their impressive capabilities, AI chatbots were not always well reviewed [24]. Google’s chatbots have been criticized in some cases for their limited abilities and inability to provide satisfactory responses to user queries. However, recent advancements in GAI have shown promise, and chatbots such as ChatGPT demonstrate the potential for these technologies to continue to evolve and improve. It will be important to continue to explore new ways to apply AI chatbots in a way that maximizes their benefits and minimizes their limitations.\n\nIn the past, human-trained models could classify text according to labels suggested by researchers. This type of training is referred to as supervised learning and involves a human overseeing and instructing the model. Text-based models, on the other hand, are currently being trained using a self-supervised learning approach. This method feeds a model a large amount of text, which helps it generate predictions. For instance, models can predict how a sentence will conclude. These models can become very accurate with the correct sample text, such as a broad swath of online text.\n\nIn 2023, GAI was showcased in an epochal manner. AI disrupted the world in 2022 as multiple startups such as DALL-E, MidJourney, and StableDiffusion appeared. Then, in just five days, ChatGPT became one of the most used platforms on the internet, with over a million users. In response to ChatGPT, Google on 7 February 2023 introduced Bard [25]. Google’s newly launched web app, Bard, is expected to be integrated with the company’s other products, including Google Maps and Gmail. The emergence of large language models such as Bard and ChatGPT highlights the evolution of AI from being innocuous to invasive. However, they also pave the way for more productive and creative applications\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
