Software engineers can use generative AI in pair programming and to do augmented coding and train LLMs to develop applications that generate code when given a natural-language prompt describing what that code should do.\n\nSoftware engineering is a significant function in most companies, and it continues to grow as all large companies, not just tech titans, embed software in a wide array of products and services. For example, much of the value of new vehicles comes from digital features such as adaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and IoT connectivity.\n\nAccording to our analysis, the direct impact of AI on the productivity of software engineering could range from 20 to 45 percent of current annual spending on the function. This value would arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system designs. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and capabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study found that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent faster than those not using the tool. An internal McKinsey empirical study of software engineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced the time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work experience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment.\n\nOur analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in productivity that generative AI could bring by improving code or enhancing IT architecture—which can improve productivity across the IT value chain. However, the quality of IT architecture still largely depends on software architects, rather than on initial drafts that generative AI’s current capabilities allow it to produce.\n\nLarge technology companies are already selling generative AI for software engineering, including GitHub Copilot, which is now integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and Replit, used by more than 20 million coders.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# How product R&D could be transformed\n\n# Early research analysis\n\nResearchers use generative AI to enhance market reporting, ideation, and product or solution drafting.\n\n# Virtual design\n\nResearchers use generative AI to generate prompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them to iterate quickly with more design options.\n\n# Virtual simulations\n\nResearchers accelerate and optimize the virtual simulation phase if combined with new deep learning generative design techniques.\n\n# Physical test planning\n\nResearchers optimize test cases for more efficient testing, reducing the time required for physical build and testing.\n\n# Product R&D\n\nGenerative AI’s potential in R&D is perhaps less well recognized than its potential in other business functions. Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with a value ranging from 10 to 15 percent of overall R&D costs.\n\nFor example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others.\n\n22  The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nWhile other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply AI in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, can limit their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models that have been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models optimized for a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types of products to which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models lack the capabilities to help design products across all industries.\n\nIn addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate designs, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the following examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring:\n\n- Enhanced design. Generative AI can help product designers reduce costs by selecting and using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can lead to cost reductions in logistics and production.\n- Improved product testing and quality. Using generative AI in generative design can produce a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. Generative AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial phases involving customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing candidates.\n\nWe also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use of which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even greater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI.\n\nWhile we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, we did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AI TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI tools assist engineers in coding, reducing development time by providing drafts and serving as a knowledge base.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGINEERS<|>PERSON<|>Engineers utilize AI tools for coding, testing, and maintenance in software engineering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT GITHUB COPILOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub Copilot is a generative AI tool integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4 that helps software developers complete tasks faster.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPLIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Replit is a platform used by over 20 million coders that incorporates generative AI for coding assistance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entos is a biotech pharmaceutical company that uses generative AI for designing small-molecule therapeutics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R&D<|>EVENT<|>Research and Development (R&D) processes are enhanced by generative AI to improve productivity and design efficiency.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENGINEERS<|>AI TOOLS<|>Engineers use AI tools to assist in coding and software development tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT GITHUB COPILOT<|>ENGINEERS<|>Engineers utilize Microsoft GitHub Copilot to complete coding tasks more efficiently<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPLIT<|>ENGINEERS<|>Engineers use Replit as a platform for coding assistance and collaboration<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENTOS<|>R&D<|>Entos applies generative AI in its R&D processes to design new therapeutics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI TOOLS<|>R&D<|>AI tools enhance the R&D process by providing insights and improving design efficiency<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
