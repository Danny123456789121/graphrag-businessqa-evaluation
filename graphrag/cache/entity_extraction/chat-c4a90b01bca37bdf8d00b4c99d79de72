However, this promising innovation is met with a scholarly discourse grappling with an interplay between the promising capabilities and potential drawbacks. This conversation frequently includes dystopian forecasts of mass unemployment and detrimental repercussions concerning academic research integrity. Despite the current hype, existing research exploring the intersection between AI and the logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM) sector remains limited. Therefore, this editorial seeks to fill this void, synthesizing the potential applications of AI within the L&SCM domain alongside an analysis of the implementation challenges. In doing so, we propose a robust research framework as a primer and roadmap for future research. This will give researchers and organizations comprehensive insights and strategies to navigate the complex yet promising landscape of AI integration within the L&SCM domain.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (hereafter referred to as AI) is high on the Gartner hype cycle concerning logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM)-related technologies. Various AI manifestations, including robotic process automation (e.g., collaborative robots or “cobots”), techniques in computer vision, speech recognition, machine and deep learning, and natural language processing, have opened new pathways to efficiently and effectively manage complex decision making and operations (Pessot et al., 2023). Figure 1 illustrates the capabilities of existing AI applications in the business ecosystem. These cutting-edge resources can potentially develop dynamic capabilities, enabling organizations to reinvent structures, flex policies, innovate processes, and offer novel improvisations toward value creation (Richey et al., 2022). L&SCM managers now hope for exceptionally rapid data- and objective decision making (Brau et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, we have all experienced this hype before, haven't we? Only a few years ago, stock prices were exploding at (soon to be) overvalued corporations claiming significant investments in blockchain technology (Gligor et al., 2022; Treiblmaier & Garaus, 2023; Treiblmaier & Rejeb, 2023). Hype-laden speculation is common in L&SCM practice and research because technology is vital to moving goods, information, finances, and people. Nevertheless, AI feels different from previous technological advancements. AI has already demonstrated varying degrees of success. Individuals—like editors—are taking immediate notice of AI's ability to accumulate “plausible” written text (Boston Consulting Group, 2023). Robots show remarkable dexterity, causing the uninitiated to reflect on some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies. All humor aside, our research question at the Journal of Business Logistics (JBL) should center on what, when, how, and why AI truly adds value. Still, AI presents a paradox as it reduces human involvement in simplifying tasks while simultaneously burdening humans with new decision-making responsibilities arising from the information it generates. Generative AI refers to integrating machine learning models to fabricate novel content. This encompasses text, audio, video, imagery, software code, and simulations based on large datasets that train the generative model (Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). This subset of AI technologies includes algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) techniques (Budhwar et al., 2023; Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). The output quality hinges on the quality of its input, considering both the training data and the prompts provided by users to define the desired task. The authenticity of responses from generative AI models such as GPT4 is constrained, given that these algorithms are “opaque” in their methodology, not illuminating how the responses were generated. There is concern about these algorithms generating spurious information, euphemistically termed “hallucinations,” and stoking considerable concerns regarding trustworthiness. This carries significant ethical and reputational risks for supply chain planning.\n\n# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L\n\n# Insufficient data\n\n# Simulating scenarios to evaluate potential maximum solution.\n\nE.g., cyber security assessment\n\n# Supervised\n\nUsing AI generated machine learning insights for innovation\n\nE.g., service innovation\n\n# Supervised and Rule-based system\n\nE.g., online chatbots for answering customer queries.\n\n# Natural language processing and Speech recognition\n\nE.g., predictive maintenance of machines\n\n# Automated decision-making.\n\nE.g., cobots.\n\n# Deep learning\n\nVision Processing and Deep learning\n\n# Context-known.\n\n# Context-unknown.\n\n# F I G U R E ¡ 1 ¡  AI capabilities in existing business applications.\n\nlost $100 billion in shares due to an inaccurate response from its AI chatbot on Twitter during a demonstration in February 2023 (Thorbecke, 2023).\n\nThe emergence of ChatGPT in the public sphere has ignited a surge of interest within the AI chatbot market (Davenport, 2023). Microsoft's announcement of a $10 billion investment in OpenAI has galvanized this trend, impelling other technology providers to join the race. Google recently unveiled an experimental service named “Bard” and “Project Magi,” aimed at revolutionizing web search experiences (Data Scientist, 2023), while Meta introduced LLaMA, a language model comprising 65 billion parameters (Meta, 2023). Similarly, Baidu launched a ChatGPT-style service named “Wenxin Yiyan” in Chinese or “Ernie Bot” in English. Additional entrants include Character.ai, an AI chatbot capable of impersonating famous individuals or fictional characters.
