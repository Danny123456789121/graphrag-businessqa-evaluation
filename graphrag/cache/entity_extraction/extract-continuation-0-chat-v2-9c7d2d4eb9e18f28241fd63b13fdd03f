Just as a single OCS can be tied to different benefits, such as OCS related to collaborative relationships for sustainability can bring companies nine of the ten sustainability benefits identified in the survey. This represents how important OCSs development is for companies to achieve a number of sustainability benefits.\n\nBy converging content analysis results from the seven OCS categories and the ten associated expected corporate sustainability benefits, an integrative conceptual framework emerged (Fig. 9). The framework summarizes the main findings of this research. The OCSs categories are presented along with the code of the articles that addressed them. CSBs categories are also presented along with OCS categories to which they are related, and along with the code of the article that addressed such relationships (codes are detailed in Appendix 1).\n\n# Fig. 9. Conceptual integrative framework relating OCS and expected corporate sustainability benefits.\n\n|Expected corporate sustainability benefits|OCS1|OCS2|OCS3|OCS4|OCS5|OCS6|OCS7|QCS2|QCS3| | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Support for environmental management systems| | | | | |1|14| | | | | | | | |\n|Improves environmental collaboration| | |38|85|87|30| | | | | | | | | |\n|Support sustainable innovation| |22|1+| |11|28| | | | | | | | | |\n|Capabilities linked to collaborative relationships for sustainability| | | |44|14|36|32|40| | | | | | | |\n|Support for environmental strategy / strategic proactivity| |60|37| |244| | | | | | | | | | |\n|Improves firm performance|41|OCS6|OCS7|337|244|42|28| | | | | | | | |\n|Improves environmental adaptability|OCS1|OCS2|OCS3|OCS4|OCS5|OCS6|OCS7| | | | | | | | |\n|Green supply chain support| |OCS2|OCS3|OCS6|OCS4|OCSS| | | | | | | | | |\n|Improves the absorption of knowledge about sustainable issues| |OCS2|OCS3|OCS6|OCS4|OCSS| | | | | | | | | |\n\nThe colors demonstrate the presence of these categories in the analyzed papers. For example, the OCS categories and the CSB categories in green are the most studied by the sample's paper; the yellow has a moderate number of studies, while the red ones were categories with a greater scarcity of researches. Thus, based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature, as well as those that still need further investigation. Through the framework, it is also possible to identify articles referring to each category (OCSs and CSBs), and the relations between these categories as addressed in each of the articles, thus helping to disseminate knowledge about these topics and further the development of new research associated to these constructs.\n\n# 5. Literature gaps and opportunities for future research\n\nFrom the quantitative and qualitative analyses, it was possible to analyze the characteristics and tendencies of the articles that addressed OCSs. Thus, we identified the main gaps in the literature and, from them, we proposed opportunities for future researches in relation to method used, sustainability pillars, business arrangements, countries and relationships between OCS and CSB categories.\n\n# Methods\n\nRegarding the methods used (Fig. 4), qualitative approaches require more research, such as single and multiple case studies, longitudinal case studies (which appear in a small number in the sample). Salim et al. (2019) corroborate with our findings, although the authors suggested focusing on internal eco-innovation capabilities by developing action research. Longitudinal case studies are relevant since sustainable actions and results from the development of OCS can, in most cases, be better visualized and measured over time. Qualitative approaches, in spite of limitations in relation to the generalization of results, are able to make in-depth and detailed analyses of the phenomenon under study. Surveys are not able to accomplish this because they are descriptive. New research can also use mixed approaches, as also recommended by Amui et al. (2017).\n\nThe survey method was predominant (Fig. 4). Thus, future studies can use mathematical modeling, such as multicriteria tools to evaluate the maturity degree of\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\ncompanies in relation to OCSs and prioritize factors and sub-factors relevant to the development of OCSs, for example.\n\n# Sustainability pillars\n\nUpon analyzing the studies, there are opportunities for new studies relating OC to social issues, since this pillar has been studied separately from the environmental pillar only by Ramachandran (2011) (see Fig. 5). Further studies should deal with more than one pillar (environmental, social and economic), since most papers dealing with the environmental pillar along with other pillars, nevertheless, have a main focus on the environmental pillar.\n\n# Business arrangement\n\nConsidering that OCSs were studied to a large extent in the context of individual firms (Fig. 6), the importance of developing researches in different productive arrangements is stressed, such as industrial clusters, since only Hilliard and Jacobson (2011) studied OCS using this focus.
