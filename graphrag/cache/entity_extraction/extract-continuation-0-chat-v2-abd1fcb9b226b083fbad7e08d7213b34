We measure the exposures using our three measures of firm-level emissions. Our treatment sample is the subset of firms in the largest quartile of the distribution of firms sorted by the size of their carbon emission as of the end of 2014. We match these firms with a control group of firms with similar characteristics identified by two different techniques: the nearest neighbor and the Mahalanobis distance. The matching characteristics we use are the same as those we include in our return regressions. We report the results based on the nearest neighbor matching in Table 15. The results based on Mahalanobis matching are qualitatively similar.\n\nTo validate the quality of our matching, in Table A.7, we show, as an example, the balance test for the matched samples of treatment and control firms based on the scope 1 emission levels. We find that the two samples are not very different from each other along many firm-level dimensions. Notable exceptions are market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, return on equity, and property plant and equipment for which the differences are statistically significant, though not economically large. Importantly, the differences in market capitalization and PPE are expected given that the treatment sample is based on the size of firm emissions, which are strongly correlated with both characteristics. Next, we compare the returns of firms in the treatment and control groups in the one-year period around the Paris Agreement of December 2015. Formally, we estimate the following difference-in-differences regression model:\n\nwhere TREAT is a generic indicator variable taking the value one for firms in the treatment sample and zero for firms in the control sample, and AFTER is an indicator variable equal to zero for the period 2015/05-2015/11 and equal to one for the period 2015/12-2016/05. We also include firm and year-month fixed effects in the regression. We estimate this model separately for each scope and emission measure. In the regressions, the sorts correspond to each scope measure, which then separately identify each individual treatment variable. Our coefficient of interest is e1, which measures the differential effect of the change on firms with high emissions and firms with low emissions.\n\nIn Panel A of Table A.7, we present the results for the level of total emissions. We find a strong and positive effect on returns based on scope 1 emissions, but no significant effects for the other two scopes of emissions. The effect is economically large, implying that the Paris Agreement resulted in an average increase in returns of more than 10.6% over the six-month period. In Panel B, we show the results based on changes in emissions. While the magnitudes of the results for scope 1 and scope 3 based on the model with industry fixed effects are fairly large (between 3.7% and 4.5%), they are statistically insignificant. In Panel C, we present the results based on carbon intensity. Surprisingly, we find a strong negative coefficient for scope 3 emissions. The effects for the other two scopes are small and insignificant. Overall, these results on the differential cross-sectional effects of the Paris Agreement are broadly consistent with our other results but their statistical significance is relatively small. Again, one of the reasons could be the relatively small statistical power of the tests, as returns are generally quite noisy. Another reason could be that the salient effects, such as Paris Agreement, take a longer time to materialize in investors’ beliefs.\n\nTo offer a longer-term perspective on the changing investors’ beliefs, we exploit the fact that climate change and carbon emissions were not yet salient issues in the 1990s. It is only in the last two decades, with the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and the repeated record-breaking temperatures, that climate change has turned into a widespread concern. This naturally raises the question of whether stock returns were already affected by corporate carbon emissions in the 1990s. If information about firm-level emissions was scarce and/or investors did not pay attention to carbon risk, one would expect that the pricing effects we identify between 2005 and 2017 would be much smaller back then. Given that our carbon emissions data begins in 2005, we cannot evaluate this hypothesis directly. However, we can impute back the unobserved emissions data for each firm in the 1990s from the values we observe later on. In other words, since emission levels are highly autocorrelated and the cross-sectional variation in emissions is stable over time (see Fig. 3), it seems reasonable, as a first pass, to assume that the cross-sectional variation of emissions in the 1990s tracks closely that observed in our data.\n\nSpecifically, we make the assumption that each firm with stocks trading during the 1990s has an emission intensity equal to the first officially reported value in the 2005-2017 period. We then collect the time-series information on each company’s revenues for the 1990-1999 period and impute the total value of emissions for each firm by taking the product of the emission intensity coefficient and the firm’s time-varying sales. We thus obtain a panel of imputed total corporate emissions for 1990-1999. We do exactly the same for emissions over our sample period. That is, we take the emission intensity coefficient for 2017 and impute back total emissions over the 2017-2005 sample period by multiplying this coefficient with the firm’s sales year by year. This latter imputation has the additional benefit of adding imputed emissions to our sample for all the new firms added to our sample in 2016 and provides another robustness check of our findings.\n\nNext, we estimate the regression model in (1) using the imputed emission values for both time periods and report the results in Table\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aimed at combating climate change and its impacts, adopted in December 2015.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Firms are business entities that may have varying exposures to carbon policy risk and are analyzed for their emissions and returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON EMISSIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carbon emissions refer to the release of carbon into the atmosphere, which is a significant factor in climate change and is measured for firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREATMENT SAMPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The treatment sample consists of firms in the largest quartile of carbon emissions as of the end of 2014, used for analysis in the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTROL GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The control group is a set of firms matched with the treatment sample based on similar characteristics for comparative analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>FIRMS<|>The Paris Agreement influences the returns of firms based on their exposure to carbon policy risk<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREATMENT SAMPLE<|>FIRMS<|>The treatment sample is a subset of firms analyzed for their emissions and returns in relation to the Paris Agreement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTROL GROUP<|>FIRMS<|>The control group is used to compare against the treatment sample to assess the impact of the Paris Agreement on firm returns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON EMISSIONS<|>FIRMS<|>Firms are evaluated based on their carbon emissions, which are critical for understanding their financial performance post-Paris Agreement<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
