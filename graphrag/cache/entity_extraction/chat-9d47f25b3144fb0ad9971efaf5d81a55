Studies that use accounting-based measures (for example, accounting ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, or return on sales) to proxy for financial performance find a stronger positive impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than studies that use market-based measures (for example, stock price or market return). Results in Table 4 indicate that sustainability performance effects are stronger in studies where accounting-based measures (r = 0.1929, p < 0.01) are used as compared to those where the market-based measures are used (r = 0.1520).\n\nResults in Table 3 also suggest a significant difference between long-term and short-term effects of sustainability performance on financial performance (b = 13.9943, p < 0.01). Further analysis in Table 4 suggests that sustainability performance effects are stronger in the studies where the impact is examined in the long run (r = 0.2143, p < 0.01), as compared to those where the impact is examined in the short run (r = 0.1576). Sustainability performance has a stronger impact on financial performance when the examined relationship is long-term compared to short-term.\n\n# Sample-Related Moderators of Corporate Sustainability Performance Effects on Financial Performance\n\nThe mixed results observed in previous studies in our dataset can also be explained by differences in the sample firms used in the studies. The effects of sustainability performance are significantly different for studies whose samples are composed of multiple industries versus a single industry (b = 9.7899, p < 0.01). Multi-industry samples present a stronger impact on the financial-sustainability performance (r = 0.1837, p < 0.01) than a single industry (r = 0.1339).\n\nThe effects of sustainability performance are also significantly different for studies that examine U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms (b = 2.8029, p < 0.01). Non-U.S. sample firms (r = 0.1862, p < 0.15) show a stronger impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than the U.S. sample firms (r = 0.1662).\n\nThe time when the sustainability performance is examined is also a significant moderator. There is a significant variation of sustainability performance effects according to whether or not the study was pre- or post-2000 (b = 19.0246, p < 0.01).\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?\n\n# 11\n\n# TABLE 4\n\n# Univariate Results for Corporate Sustainability Performance Moderators\n\n|Sample Size|Number of Observations|Mean Effect Size|Mean Variance| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Environmental*|166|24,574|0.2035|0.0346|\n|Social|32|6,940|0.0689|0.0146|\n|Accounting-based*|163|16,901|0.1929|0.0352|\n|Market-based|35|14,613|0.1520|0.0133|\n|Short term|129|22,530|0.1576|0.0242|\n|Long term*|69|8,984|0.2143|0.0446|\n|Post-2000|42|8,855|0.1009|0.0115|\n|Pre-2000*|156|22,659|0.2023|0.0367|\n|Multi-industry*|126|25,079|0.1837|0.0114|\n|Single industry|72|6,435|0.1339|0.0662|\n|U.S. firms|118|19,676|0.1662|0.0438|\n|Non-U.S. firms**|80|11,838|0.1862|0.1436|\n|Complex|21|10,229|0.1480|0.0069|\n|Simple*|177|21,285|0.1863|0.0342|\n\n*, ** p < 0.01 and p < 0.15, respectively.

Results in Table 3 indicate that studies where complex methods (for example, two-stage least squares, or three-stage least squares regression method) are employed are significantly different from other simple methods (studies using regression, correlation coefficient, survey) (b = 16.5990, p < 0.01). Post hoc analyses in Table 4 reveal that the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance is significantly weaker when complex methods are used (r = 0.1480, p < 0.01), as compared to those using simple methods (r = 0.1863).\n\n# Moderator Results (Subsample)\n\nThe previous subsection “Moderator Results (Full Sample)” reports the main moderator effect for the full sample consisting of 198 effect sizes.
