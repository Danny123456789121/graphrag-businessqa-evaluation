While, this model will be made open source by Meta, there is also lack of consensus among the technology developers on open sourcing. On the one hand, advocates of open sourcing believe that it allows experts to scrutinize models that may help mitigate reli-\n\nability issues and evolve them for societal good, creators of GPT4 (Open AI) are wary of models being copied by rival competitors which will reduce competitive advantage, and being misused by bad actors.\n\nAlthough we understand the risks and issues associated with generative AI models, HRM scholars can contrib-\n\nute to ‘interpretability research and open sourcing’ by understanding the role of different stakeholders within and between organisations in the business ecosystem that will help promote ethical use of such applications. In this vein, HRM research should develop actionable insights drawn from empirical evidence and case-studies on the best prac-\n\ntices to train generative AI models, explain how decisions are made by humans when automated opaque algorithms are used to analyse data, embed robust mechanisms to increase safety and security of such systems, assess and mitigate the risks, and help the organisations achieve and maintain a desired level of quality.\n\n# 6.5\n\n# Theme 5: Research methods\n\nThe impact of generative AI tools on the way we develop, and conduct research has emerged as one of the most popular themes in the literature across disciplines. The ability of tools such as elicit to process, analyse and summarise research articles has fuelled heated debates about the future of academic research, especially future of review articles (AI Research Assistant, 2023). Moreover, acknowledging AI bots has authors in research articles (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2022) has put complex unanswered questions about research ethics and integrity (Dasborough, 2023). Generative AI tools can inte-\n\ngrate different literature to generate a very descriptive review based on the research papers uploaded by a researcher. However, we are yet to come across a unique contribution critically analysing strengths and weaknesses of multiple viewpoints, describing inherent meaning behind the viewpoints, and finally leading to novel theoretical developments done by generative AI. For instance, bibliometrics analysis has become a popular method to understand research trends by analysing bibliographic data obtained from research databases using software tools (Mukerjee etal., 2022). However, the analysis does not automatically and without expertise and knowledge of human researchers, lead to critical insights,\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 45\n\nunearthing reason behind interesting phenomena and evolution of theoretical contributions and such is the case with generative AI. Irrespective of the preliminary guidelines and policies provided by the publishers on the use of AI tools in research (for e.g., Elsevier, 2023), the proliferation of such tools will increase and ought to become more sophisticated. Therefore, future studies should identify the advantage and limitations of such tools, and how they can be used responsibly in academic research upholding the quality, contributions, impact and integrity of the work we publish.\n\nAlthough AI systems are improving, a clear feature of present AI generated text is a certain blandness. It has few grammatical imperfections (although ChatGPT has clearly not read Fowler's Modern English Usage), but at the same time, it does not carry that whiff of life experience that infuses human writing styles. It certainly may be capable of summarizing a debate but does not yet seem capable of generating novel or counter-intuitive insights, or indeed of exercising moral judgements. In this vein, the meaning of ‘responsible HRM research’ should be debated and defined to evolve and adapt research methods and philosophies, in the age of machines becoming ghost writers.\n\nA serious concern is AI's potential to generate fake quantitative or qualitative research results; understandably, there are likely to be much higher expectations for data transparency in the future, and indeed, greater documentation of the research process. AI detection software is rapidly advancing. This raises the question as to how journals might deploy this software in the future. In other words, what might be acceptable in helping automate the more mechanistic aspects of the research process, and when does falsification and crookery start? Again, this does hold a potentially career threatening risk for early academic adopters of AI. Any sharp practices that escape detection and enable publication now are likely to be exposed by more sophisticated AI detection software in the future; as with plagiarists, such individuals will be stalked by the risk of lustration for the remainder of their academic careers. Moreover, scholarly associations are currently devising guidelines around the usage of AI; such rules will inevitably lead to more restrictions than the present Wild West. Potential authors need to be very aware of this in the same manner as inhabitants of nineteenth century Tombstone, Arizona, might, with the wisdom of retrospect, have been well advised to take note of the prospective arrival in town of a group of lawmen (and, indeed, a certain dentist) more seriously.\n\nIt also does raise issues around academic careers; ambitious scholars typically advance their careers by constantly honing their critical thinking, analytical and writing skills. It could well be argued that such academic skills may become devalued. However, this does not take account of the worth of novel ideas that are founded in the human world, and indeed, the value of scholarly conversation. HRM is about people, and for all humanity's flaws, it is a general principle that members of a group have a better idea of their interests than outsiders, be the latter human or mechanical. There is also the Hawking principle to consider: ‘when more advanced life forms meet more primitive ones, it never ends well for the latter’.\n\n# 7. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nAs with any new technology, AI may have open ended effects on HRM, the study of the same, and indeed, economy and society at large.
