Several reasons may explain why empirical studies on CSP mutual funds exhibit a relatively weak CSP-CFP relation. Realized performance in mutual funds depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, & Xu, 2001; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009), construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, & Thorley, 2002), and costs for portfolio implementation which can be as high as 2.5% per annum in various fees that are carried by the average mutual fund (Barber, Odean, & Zheng, 2005; Carhart, 1997; Khorana, Servaes, & Tufano, 2009). The ‘drowned out by other noise’ argument (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527) thus seems to be even more valid for mutual funds, which are the ultimate amalgam of market-based measures. Nevertheless, in the worst case, mutual funds investors could expect to lose nothing compared to conventional mutual fund investments.\n\nSixth, we expected that early published analyses would show greater effect sizes compared with subsequently published meta-analyses. This potential diminishing effect over time as data accumulate is well documented (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Indeed, we find significantly lower correlations for more recent meta-studies compared to older studies. However, the additional analysis at primary study level (n = 551) revealed that the shrinkage in correlations in the meta-analyses most likely does not indicate a shrinkage of the actual CSP-CFP relation. Correlations at primary study level, in contrast to our findings at the meta-study level, do not shrink. One explanation for this finding is that more recent meta-analytical research methods have become more sophisticated though using higher attenuation factors.\n\nFinally, there was the suspicion raised that evidence of the CSP-CFP relation depends on the kind of publishing journal. The speculation was that SIM journals tend to publish ‘better results’. Interestingly, we find the opposite result: ‘truth is not made’ in special SIM journals and low-impact factor journals, but rather, in particular, in high-impact factor and general management journals, at least at a meta-analysis level. We did not discover any publication bias analyzed by Fail Safe, funnel plot, or with regards to the publishing status of a paper. In line with previous findings (Aguinis et al., 2011; Lipsey & Wilson, 1993), we also reveal that the methodological quality of meta-analyses has no influence on the reported effect sizes.\n\nConcluding, this study takes an instrumental point of view: we ask whether it pays to be good and find that in fact it does. In light of the urgent global challenges that society faces, it appears essential that firms and investors consider any action possible to safeguard the living conditions for future generations. They can be encouraged that on first glance competing instrumental and moral motivations can supplement each other.\n\n# References\n\nAguinis H, Glavas A. 2012.
