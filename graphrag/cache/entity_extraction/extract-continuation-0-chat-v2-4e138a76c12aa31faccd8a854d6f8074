We classify organizations as either private or public.\n\nUnder the supervision of the public, public companies always disclose large amounts of information with respect to environmental and social issues in order to justify their existence, document their performance, and satisfy shareholders (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006). For instance, public firms that receive greater media coverage are used to disclose more CSR information (Frost, 2000). Information asymmetry is relatively mild between stakeholders and public firms because relevant stakeholders can access information to evaluate firms through public disclose report and other non-CSR information. Therefore, the signaling role of CSR practices becomes diluted for public firms. Besides, public firms that offer securities to the general public through a\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nStock exchange are under stakeholder scrutiny (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), so that they must undertake CSR to compete in the current competitive environment. However, “if an entire sector is collaborating on CSR, the reward of competitive advantage for each company involved is diluted” (Draper, 2006: 410). Therefore, public firms may find it difficult to differentiate themselves from their competitors through normal CSR practices.\n\nIn contrast, the phenomenon of information asymmetry is more serious to privates. Although more private companies began to realize the value of CSR practices in East Asia, only a few private companies provide relatively little detailed CSR information in the annual reports, and it is often qualitative and not quantitative (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006). Frost’s (2000) study found several private firms even are not disclosing any information on their CSR impacts. In this case, stakeholders hardly evaluate private firm’s CSR attitude because of lacking adequate information. The signaling role of CSR practices is more valuable for private firms than public firms. In addition, private firms, run by private individuals or groups, receive less press and public attention, so they are more likely to have relatively flexible CSR practices. If outside stakeholders are aware that private firms actively participate in CSR, their activities can be good differentiators for leveraging and acquiring more intangible resources, including organizational reputation and highly skilled human resources. Hence, we propose:\n\n# Hypothesis 7\n\nIn East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in private firms than in public firms.\n\n# Exploratory methodological moderators and CSR’s evolution\n\n# Measurement issue\n\nMeta-analytic reviews have the advantage of dealing with measures, methods, and moderators from prior research (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Previous studies on the CSR–performance relationship have confounded CSR measurement through a variety of data sources and measures (Allouche & Laroche, 2005; Griffin & Mahon, 1997). We devote extra attention to investigating CSR measurement as a potential cause of mixed findings regarding the CSR–business performance link.\n\nConsistent with Dixon-Fowler et al. (2012), we consider two CSR measures: archival (indirect) and self-report (direct) data. Archival data come from third parties such as Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (Cheung et al., 2010), Asian Sustainability Rating (Scholtens & Kang, 2012), Shanghai National Accounting Institute (Li, & Zhang, 2010), and Korea Economic Justice Institute (Choi et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2011). Self-report data come from surveys of managers through questionnaires. The different CSR measures are controversial: self-report data have potential inherent bias because they cannot measure CSR objectively (Schwarz, 1999), while archival data fail to depict the versatility of CSR activities. Therefore, we review the Asian CSR literature methodically to examine whether using archival data generates distinctive outcomes compared with self-report measures. Addressing this methodological moderator with the help of meta-analysis will reveal whether different types of measures cause the business performance variances previously reported.\n\n# CSR evolution\n\nIn addition, meta-analytic technology will help solve the debate surrounding whether CSR may decrease, stabilize, or increase in East Asian contexts. In recent years, CEOs have been attracted to CSR rationalizations and the possible positive links between CSR and business performance (Vogel, 2005). Two decades ago, most managers perceived CSR practice as irrelevant for performance improvement (Klepper & Mackler, 1986), but the US Chamber of Commerce and Corporate Citizenship Center reported that 82 % of firms now believe that CSR adds value to practice (Lee, 2008), indicating that perceptions about CSR have changed considerably in the United States. Due to the difficulty of collecting longitudinal data, current literature scarcely explore the evolution of CSR. From the perspective of institutional theory, East Asian transition economy, such as China, has the characteristics of weak institutional framework, underdeveloped legal system, and incomplete market information (Luo, 2003). At the initial stage of transitional development, CSR practices can play an important role in sending green and good signals to stakeholders and cover the shortage of information asymmetry. However, as the acceleration of institutional transition increases, an increasing number of organizations realize the importance of CSR information disclosure. The phenomenon of information asymmetry will be alleviated and the value of CSR signals will be decreased. To determine whether East Asian businesses similarly value CSR all the time, we used our meta-analytical tools to explore CSR’s evolutionary path in the East Asian context. Figure 1 summarizes the overall conceptual model of our meta-analysis.\n\n# Methods\n\n# Sample and coding\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we performed a meta-analysis of extant studies concerning the relationship between CSR and business performance in East Asia.
