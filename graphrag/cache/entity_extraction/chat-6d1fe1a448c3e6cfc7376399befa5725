These practices were called sharing, geosocial development, perseverance, resilience and moderation, later informing the development of a theory of corporate sustainability [12]. The findings of the previous studies [5, 27] also endorse the prior findings by Kantabutra et al. [26]. In conclusion, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is empirically endorsed as an approach to corporate sustainability.\n\nIn 2016, there was a significant development in moving the Sufficiency Economy philosophy forward in the scholarly community. A group of scholars who worked in the SEP areas came together and inductively developed a model called “Sufficiency Thinking” shown in Figure 1 [28] (p. 52) the research framework for the present exploration. The Sufficiency Thinking model describes the theoretical process from virtues to well-being sustainability.\n\n|PERSONAL|WISDOM|MIDDLE|PATH|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Enduring Attributes (virtues)|Personal knowledge|Sufficiency mindset|principles 'SEPork3|\n|Shared virtues|Shared knowledge|moderation|reasonable - prudence|\n|Group attributes| |Self-reliance| |\n|GENERAL|WISDOM|MIDDLE|PATH|\n|Inputs|Outputs/outcomes|Influences| |\n\nLEGEND: Process direction, Influence direction, Feedback loop\n\nFigure 1. The Sufficiency Thinking model [28] (p. 52).\n\nThe Sufficiency Thinking model [28] begins with virtuous individuals which together develop shared virtues in an organization over time. The next model element is the knowledge that individuals bring into the organization, which over time becomes shared knowledge. Virtuous and knowledgeable individuals are not sufficient to sustain an organization. They are required to have a certain mindset to guide their decision-making process in order to respond effectively to the internal and external environments. This mindset is called “Sufficiency Mindset”. Such a mindset is informed by the moderation, reasonableness and prudence principles. Before deciding, one must acquire the necessary knowledge while taking into consideration its consequences on all possible stakeholders. In other words, one must adhere to the ethical and virtuous principles in making such a decision. Next, the behavioral consequence of such the decision-making process is called 23 sustainable leadership practices or 23 work principles. The 23 sustainable leadership practices [29] (pp. 27–36) are adopted in the present study as demonstrated in Table 2 below. More explanations about each of the practices can be found in Avery and Bergsteiner [2].\n\n|Leadership Elements|Sustainable Leadership Philosophy|Shareholder-First Philosophy|\n|---|---|---|\n|Foundation practices|Sophisticated, stakeholder, social, sharing|Tough, ruthless, asocial, profit-at-any-cost|\n|1.

Methodology\n\nTo gain a deep understanding of how a business adopts a Thai Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve its sustainability performance, a qualitative approach is used to explore how corporate leaders ensure organizational sustainability. Figure 2 presents the research methodology process. We start with a literature review relevant to the Sufficiency Economy philosophy and corporate sustainability.
