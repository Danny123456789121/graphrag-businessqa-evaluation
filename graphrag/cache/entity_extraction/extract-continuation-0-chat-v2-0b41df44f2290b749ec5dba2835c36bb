Note that when conditioning on downside beta and upside beta, we remove the full sample beta (denoted by MKT in the table) to avoid multicollinearity.\n\n# 4 Findings\n\nTable 4 presents the results, which can be summarized in the following four findings: (i) for the shorter sample of November 2003 to March 2009, the DMC factor has a positive price of risk, which is highly significant in all cases. This implies that the higher a firm’s exposure to carbon risk, the higher the expected return, even when conditioning on a large number of control variables; (ii) for this sample, the DMC factor alone accounts for one-third of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns; (iii) however, when using the longer sample of November 2003 to December 2012, the explanatory power of the carbon risk factor diminishes and becomes insignificant; and (iv) overall the model specification that conditions on all control variables accounts for more than 90% of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns in either sample.\n\nThese results indicate that carbon risk can explain a large part of the variation of stock returns for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. For this sample, therefore, firms that have a high exposure to carbon risk (i.e., dirty firms) require higher expected returns. This provides direct empirical support for the second testing hypothesis (H2) for\n\n16\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 8 Robustness and Further Analysis\n\nThis section extends the empirical analysis in several directions in order to assess the robustness of our main finding on the carbon premium.\n\n# 8.1 The Carbon Premium, the EUA Price and Energy Factors\n\nFirst, we provide an empirical examination of whether the carbon premium can be explained by conditioning on the price for carbon allowances and the price of energy indexes such as electricity, oil, natural gas and coal.\n\nIn line with Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009) and Koch and Bassen (2013), for the price of carbon allowances we consider monthly settlement prices of EUA futures contracts traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the European Climate Exchange (ECX). We construct a continuous price series that combines a series of contracts as follows. In Phase I, the EUA price series is equal to the price of the December 2008 contract. In Phase II, the EUA price series uses the December 2009 contract until its last trading day, then switches to the December 2010 contract until its last trading day, and so on until December 2012. Figure 4 plots the EUA futures price in euros.\n\nFollowing prior literature (e.g., Oberndorfer, 2009, and Koch and Bassen, 2013), for oil, gas and coal prices we use the following one-month futures contracts: the Brent crude oil front-month forward from Independent Commodity Information Services (ICIS); the front-month natural gas forward from the ICE; and the one-month ahead New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures contract for coal converted to euros. Note that the European counterpart to this contract (i.e., the one-month ahead API 2 coal futures contract delivered to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp) is not available for the full sample but the correlation in the two series is about 90%. Finally, for electricity prices, we use the Phelix Month Base from the EEX in Leipzig as in Oberndorfer (2009).\n\nAll these data are taken from various sources. The sharp decline in the EUA price around the end of April 2006 is the focus of Hintermann (2010), Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) and Jong, Couwenberg and Woerdman (2014). These papers argue that the decline was primarily due to the release of information about aggregate EU emissions indicating an unanticipated surplus in available EUAs. For studies on the time-series behavior of EUA prices, see also Paolella and Taschini (2008), Benz and Truck (2009), and Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009).\n\nfrom Datastream. In all cases, we use the price data to generate a time series for the return to each variable. For example, we compute the return to the EUA as: rEUA;t = ln(PEU A;t) - ln(PEU A;t - 1), where PEU A;t is\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DMC FACTOR<|>EVENT<|>The DMC factor is a financial metric that measures the price of risk associated with carbon exposure in firms, indicating that higher carbon risk leads to higher expected returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUA FUTURES CONTRACTS<|>EVENT<|>EUA futures contracts are financial instruments traded on the Intercontinental Exchange that represent the price of carbon allowances in the European market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is a global marketplace for trading various financial instruments, including EUA futures contracts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN CLIMATE EXCHANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Climate Exchange (ECX) is a platform for trading carbon emissions allowances and is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRENT CRUDE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Brent crude oil is a major trading classification of crude oil originating from the North Sea, used as a benchmark for oil prices globally.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL GAS<|>EVENT<|>Natural gas is a fossil fuel used for energy production and heating, traded in futures contracts on various exchanges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COAL<|>EVENT<|>Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock used as a fuel source, traded in futures contracts on exchanges like NYMEX.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHELIX MONTH BASE<|>EVENT<|>The Phelix Month Base is a price index for electricity traded in the European market, specifically on the EEX in Leipzig.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVEMBER 2003 TO MARCH 2009<|>EVENT<|>This time period is significant for the analysis of the DMC factor's impact on stock returns related to carbon risk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVEMBER 2003 TO DECEMBER 2012<|>EVENT<|>This time period is used to assess the explanatory power of the carbon risk factor over a longer sample.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DMC FACTOR<|>EUA FUTURES CONTRACTS<|>The DMC factor is influenced by the prices of EUA futures contracts, which represent carbon risk in the market.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE<|>EUROPEAN CLIMATE EXCHANGE<|>The European Climate Exchange is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange, which facilitates trading of carbon allowances.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRENT CRUDE OIL<|>NATURAL GAS<|>Both Brent crude oil and natural gas are energy commodities traded on futures markets, influencing energy prices.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURAL GAS<|>COAL<|>Natural gas and coal are both fossil fuels traded in futures contracts, impacting energy markets and prices.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHELIX MONTH BASE<|>NATURAL GAS<|>The Phelix Month Base index for electricity prices is related to natural gas prices as they are both components of energy pricing in Europe.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DMC FACTOR<|>NOVEMBER 2003 TO MARCH 2009<|>The DMC factor's significance is highlighted during this specific time period for stock returns related to carbon risk.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DMC FACTOR<|>NOVEMBER 2003 TO DECEMBER 2012<|>The DMC factor's explanatory power is analyzed over this longer time period to assess its impact on stock returns.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
