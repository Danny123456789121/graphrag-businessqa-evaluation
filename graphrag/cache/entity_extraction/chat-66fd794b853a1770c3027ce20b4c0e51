While it is true that algorithms and data centre hardware are increasingly energy-efficient and more datacentres operate on renewable energy it needs to be stressed that the process of training a model is an expensive, data and processing hungry undertaking that requires massive amounts of energy to complete. For instance, the GPT-4 model by OpenAI, was trained on 45TB of data and over 170 trillion of parameters. It is estimated that the training process of the GPT-4 model consumed 7.5 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy. It is also estimated that another 8 MWh of energy annually will be used in the deployment of the model (the actual applications) (TS2, 2023).\n\nAdditional research effort is required to limit the amount of energy that is required for the model re-training. There are techniques being developed such as “transfer learning” that allow relevant parts of the previous model to be transferred to the new one, eliminating the need of the whole new model to be trained from scratch and therefore restricting the use of energy. Partial re-training of a model is an approach known and already used in neural networks and this approach may soon be feasible also in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nMore energy use apart from the possible environmental impact means cost. Sam Altman the CEO of OpenAI said that the cost of training GPT-4 was over $100 million (Wired, 2023). Given that the demand for better models with more up to date data is very likely to rise meaning more frequent model updates. The current approach does not seem viable even for the biggest tech companies and a new approach is needed. Some experts are of the opinion that a hybrid approach is likely to address the limitations of the current models. In such an approach as mentioned in the earlier section of this article the core LLM model would not be retrained as often but it would be capable of reaching out to on-line information available on the Internet to provide the most up to date content in its output. Such an approach is believed to be attempted by Google now with its Bard engine and by Microsoft in its GPT-powered Bing application.\n\n# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023\n\n# 2. Generative AI as a force changing the job market\n\n# 2.1. New professions\n\nNew skills and eventually new professions will be needed to embrace the benefits from the GAI family of technologies. Already now the specific skill of interaction with Large Language Models (LLM) called prompt engineering is in growing demand. Prompt engineers understand the proper flow of the interaction with GAI models to get the best possible quality outcome from them.\n\nApart from prompt-engineering and other specialized data science and development jobs such as DataOps, MLOps that will be needed to create, tune, deploy, operate and supervise machine learning models in their massive deployment potentially many more new jobs and professions will be created by the adoption of GAI technology.\n\nCurrently GAI models and especially those which are language based (LLM) rely on the semi-supervised learning method for training and tuning the algorithm. In simple terms supervised models use a form of reward and punishment to help the algorithm properly adjust internal features (weights) to produce the best quality outcome. The reinforcement (positive and negative) come either from users, from another AI model or from a specific group of employees whose job is to interact with the model and “reward” good answers and “punish” incorrect ones in a digital way. Based on this the model can tweak itself and improve the quality. This process is not only about the correctness of the generated output. It is also—and perhaps more importantly—about making sure the model does not produce harmful outcomes. Examples of harmful outcomes would include hate speech, racial, gender and minority biases or these which instruct users on how to construct explosives, cause self-harm, violence, etc. Some readers may find it surprising or even shocking that an AI model produced by a trustworthy organization (OpenAI, e.g.) can so do but it should be remembered that these models are trained entirely on the content available on the Internet which has been created by humans. In 2016 Microsoft experimented with Tay and an AI chatbot for Twitter. Because in the foreseeable future humans will still contribute to the content of the Internet models will be influenced by this content and model supervision will be needed to make sure the LLMs do not amplify hate speech or similar undesirable features.\n\n# 2.2. Professions possibly affected or replaced entirely by GAI\n\nThere are existing, traditional professions that are likely to be replaced entirely or to some extent by GAI technology. Media content creation seems to\n\n# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy\n\nbe one of the industries where the human workforce seems to be already replaced by GAI. In December 2022 the BuzzFeed company cut 12% of its staff (180 people) and subsequently in January 2023 the company stated that it will extensively use AI technologies. One published memo says: “The creative process will increasingly become AI-assisted and technology-enabled” (Vincent, 2023). The company indicates that it will use tooling provided by OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT. In November 2022 Meta made a similar move removing the fifteen United Kingdom Facebook News curators and replacing them with an AI algorithm (Metaverse Post, 2022).\n\nA report released in April 2023 by Goldman Sachs (Goldman Sachs, 2023) indicates that as many as 300 million full-time jobs will be subject to automation by Generative AI. The company analysed a set of over 900 occupations and concluded that roughly two thirds of occupations existing in the U.S. are to some degree exposed to automation as an effect of the implementation of AI technologies. In the same report the company estimates that only natural\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
