Possible negative impacts and consequences will be reduced if organizations adequately and timely identify the need to implement changes.\n\nKlarner, Probst, and Soparnot (2008) define organizational change capacity as “an organization's ability to develop and implement appropriate organizational changes to constantly adapt to its environment” (Klarner et al., 2008; p. 58). According to these authors, change is not an isolated event because multiple changes occur over time. Therefore, change capacity is a “dynamic capability” that comprises not only the organizational process of continuous learning and adjustment but also the organizational capacity to implement the necessary changes (Klarner et al., 2008).\n\nIn this step of the ISI framework, the knowledge obtained through data collection and analysis is expected to enhance the generation of ideas and proposals regarding the recognition of problems to be solved, calling upon internal and external stakeholders. The generation of ideas is developed through design and dynamic thinking processes and solution proposals should flow naturally without categorization. The scope of the problem will enhance the survival of the proposals with the highest degrees of consistency and potential, which will be naturally encouraged. The solidity of the selected proposals will depend on the predefined criteria of acceptance and of the incremental dynamics created for the required change. This dynamics will depend on stakeholders behaviours and also on organizational leadership, governance and culture (Judge, Naoumova, & Douglas, 2009). At the end of this phase, several solutions should be under consideration for the next steps.\n\n# 4.2.2 | Create and add value\n\nIt is consensual that organizations have the core purpose of creating value. As referred by the International Integrated Reporting Council, “value created by an organization over time manifests itself in increases, decreases or transformations of the capitals caused by the organization's business activities and outputs” (International Integrated Reporting Council, 2013; p. 10). A central issue in discussions regarding value creation is the context in which value is created: time, place and stakeholders involved will be determinant for the effective understanding of value creation (Vargo, Maglio, & Akaka, 2008). There are many possible definitions of value, including value-in-use and value-in-exchange (Vargo, Maglio et al. 2008), and no consensus exists regarding the effective contribution of the different value-creation components.\n\nIn this phase of ISI model, organizations are expected to understand their responsibility regarding the need to create value in different contexts of social and environmental capitals, without questioning the dynamics of the economic value. The organization's understanding regarding these issues will result either in the expansion or in the reduction of efforts and investments in the different dimensions of organizational value. Adequate organizational capacity to create materially responsible value in these dimensions is of major importance because it will impact all stakeholders.\n\n# Develop\n\nThe proposals and new ideas identified in the previous stages must be analysed, and decisions must be taken regarding the viability of their implementation. The purpose is to draw and develop a model allowing the materialization of the proposals under analysis, including the definition of priorities, the identification of necessary and available resources and the understanding of all implications associated with the proposal's implementation. The need for modification in case of new insights (e.g., new information or new technological options) should also be considered.\n\nThis process is expected to enhance the development of a possible solution for the problem under analysis, through a functional and iterative process that should be adequately planned, assessed and whenever necessary, readjusted, in order to broaden value creation opportunities.\n\nA critical factor in this “develop” stage is the adequate promotion of interactions that will foster the transformation of intangible experiences into tangible ones. This can affect channel selection processes, with potential market implications, enhancing innovation procedures and improvements in organizational efficacy and resulting in organizational differentiation and improved competitiveness.\n\n# Transform\n\nThis stage is expected to promote change through the synergistic effects of the adaptability and learning capacities enhanced in the previous stages. These new organizational skills will stimulate new behaviours. It is expected that the development of new solutions, materialized in innovative behaviours, products, and services, will provide answers to specific problems and market needs.\n\nThose who are responsible for organizational strategy should be able to recognize their limitations regarding the knowledge of all the answers to the different problems. Two approaches can be used to overcome this limitation: one directly connected with organizational operations, considering employee motivation, participation and recognition — social capital — specially focusing those who are in the middle or bottom of the organizational pyramid (sustainability operatives); another approach is to foster the participation of a broad scope of stakeholders in the search for answers, enabling the continuous collection of ideas, opinions and suggestions, which will enhance alternative solutions to both specific and more generalized problems. This plural approach should be seen as an intangible asset in the search for solutions (Freeman, Harrison, Wicks, Parmar, & Colle, 2010).\n\nThe transformation process should be structuralist, multi-dimensional and multidirectional and should promote organizational transformations at different levels — including systems, procedures and behaviours — transferring its actions to different contexts and stakeholders. This process must consider historical and contextual considerations that underlie transformations, such as technological changes in products and services that have shaped social, economic and environmental habits and contexts over time.\n\nThis organizational transformative vision is expected to create the basis for new scenarios and forecasts. This will enable the development and implementation of visionary strategies to change future habits and practices.\n\n# 4.2.3 | Value co-creation\n\nThe “value co-creation” stage aims the management of the planned change through a participative process, in which the organization and its stakeholders are included and through which knowledge is generated and transferred. Because the value incorporated in a product or service is defined by its use (value-in-use) and not by its cost (value-in-exchange), the determination of the incorporated value is up to the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
