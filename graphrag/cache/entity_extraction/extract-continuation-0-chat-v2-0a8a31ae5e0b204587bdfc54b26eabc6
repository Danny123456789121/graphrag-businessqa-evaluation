This can be offset to some extent by clarifying the respective opportunities, benefits, risks and trade-offs associated with the implementation of corporate sustainability.\n\nThree dimensions of strategic management – strategy content, context and process – have been introduced in order to clarify how corporate sustainability management can help create economic, environmental and social value. The various propositions presented highlight the relationships among the three strategic dimensions and the various elements of corporate sustainability management.\n\nPropositions 1a-d show how (first- and second-order) sustainability performance may be linked to the generation of added value for society. Propositions 2a-f describe the benefits that may be derived from corporate sustainability management for a company. Finally, propositions 3a-f describe how the various aspects of sustainability may be integrated into organizational structures at the normative, strategic and operational management levels.\n\nFigure 3 provides an overview of the relationships among the three strategy dimensions and societal and business values by making use of a sustainability impact chain.\n\nACCEPTED\n\n23\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# External stakeholders\n\n# Company\n\n# (internal stakeholder)\n\n# Sustainability\n\n# Culture\n\n# Strategy\n\n# sustainability\n\n# impact on\n\n# society and\n\n# nature\n\n# Actions\n\n# Sociocultural\n\n# and economic\n\n# conamions\n\n# Integrating strategy context into business value\n\n# Fit between strategy content and societal needs to deliver societal value\n\n# Society\n\n# Nature\n\nFigure 3: Strategic perspectives integrated into a corporate sustainability impact chain\n\nThe answers to the research questions (see section 1) are discussed below.\n\nThe first research question (“How can a strategic perspective of corporate sustainability management be conceptualized?”) was addressed by introducing three dimensions of strategic management: strategy process, content and context.\n\nThe second research question (“How can strategic success of corporate sustainability management be defined?”) was addressed by distinguishing between the societal value and business value of corporate sustainability management. By making use of first- and second-order sustainability performance levels, the various elements relevant to the assessment of the success of corporate sustainability management were clarified. First-order sustainability performance focuses on the maximization of economic, social and environmental efficiency, whereas second-order sustainability performance is characterized by its focus on systemic effectiveness.\n\nThe third research question (“How can corporations act more sustainably from a strategic point of view?”) was addressed in section 4 through a description of the process dimension and related propositions. Figure 3 shows how the strategic perspectives are integrated in the sustainability impact chain (as described in section 3.1). Integrating sustainability considerations into the strategy context is necessary to create business value. In the absence of the latter, companies\n\n24\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nwould ignore the relevant sustainability issues. Matching strategy content to societal needs allows a company to create societal value.\n\nThe paper offers both scientific and practical contributions. By combining the currently somewhat distant fields of classical management and sustainability, the paper makes a scientific contribution in that it provides, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first holistic perspective on corporate sustainability management. This helps fill gaps in the ongoing discussion about connections between issues of (strategic) management and sustainability. The practical contribution consists of specific examples, which were given to support the theoretical propositions made. This provides managers with a comprehensive overview of topics that are relevant to the integration of sustainability into daily business activities. Scholars and practitioners are invited to improve, test and amend these propositions as part of further research.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and Dr. Sara Crockett for the proof reading of the paper.\n\n# MANUS CRIP T\n\n# ACCEP TED\n\n25\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# References\n\nAburdene, P.
