The RBV focuses on resources and capabilities to explain the superior performance of some companies to reach a competitive advantage. A relevant contribution of this field is related to the dynamic capabilities approach (DC), presented by Teece et al. (1997) to explain competitive advantage in dynamic markets.\n\nHowever, the RBV was considered limited since it does not incorporate the external environment. The incorporation of environmental issues into this body of knowledge was pioneered by Hart (1995), who proposed the Natural Resource-Based View of the Firm (NRBV) as a more complete framework when considering the natural resources and environmental problems into RBV. According to Hart (1995), the challenges posed by the natural environment are among the most important factors in the new pattern of resource development and OCs. Hart and Dowell (2011) analyzed that the economic and social environmental challenges raised in the NRBV have multiplied over the years.\n\nIn this sense, Annunziata et al. (2017) argue that sustainability-oriented companies should identify and develop specific capabilities rooted in the organization to implement practices that are a source of competitiveness in an increasingly aware and attentive market for sustainability issues. The literature presents several studies that address the OCs related to obtaining strategic benefits for corporate sustainability. For instance, it mentions the use of proactive environmental strategies (Delmas et al., 2011; Fraj Andrés et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2007; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998), successful implementation of environmental management practices and systems (Charan and Murty, 2018; Yu and Ramanathan, 2016; Johnson, 2017), support of corporate social responsibility (Choi et al., 2019; Ramachandran, 2011; Renouard, 2011; Torugsa et al., 2012), and support to the management of the green supply chain (Bowen et al., 2001; Choi and Hwang, 2015; Paulraj, 2011; Peters et al., 2011). In this context, attention to organizational capabilities related to sustainability is essential.\n\nHowever, although there is a body of knowledge on OCS, there is a recent need for more research in this area. According to Gelhard and Delft (2016), the literature has\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\nbeen debating about performance in facing economic, social and environmental issues. Nevertheless, the relationship between OC and sustainability benefits remains little explored. For example, Gabler, Richey and Rapp (2015) argue that little is known about how firms determine and use the appropriate resources to maximize the performance of environmental initiatives. Yu and Ramanathan (2016) comment on the need to empirically explore the development of an environmental management capability. Hofmann et al. (2012) also stated that little is known about how strategic firm-specific capabilities may facilitate the adoption of sustainability initiatives. In particular, the present research addresses Amui et al. (2017) indication towards the opportunity for studies seeking to identify the types of dynamic capabilities that can be developed in order to more effectively overcome the emerging challenges of sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also recommended how important is further research to expand organization capabilities, especially those responsible for environmental issues.\n\nThus, since OCS can bring strategic sustainability benefits for companies, and focusing on addressing these research gaps, this study seeks to answer the following research questions: (i) What are the main types of strategic OCS addressed in the literature? (ii) May the OCSs lead to the development of corporate sustainability benefits (CSB), and what would these benefits be? (iii) How strategic OCS and CSB can be linked together to provide an integrative framework? Therefore, this paper performs a systematic literature review (SLR) by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, we proposed an integrative framework linking strategic OCS and CSB.\n\nThis paper contributes to the academic literature in some ways. First, it advances the knowledge of OCS, since it identifies and maps several strategic sustainability benefits that can be achieved by organizations through the development of OCs. Second, although recently Amui et al. (2017) have conducted a SLR on capabilities for sustainability in order to systematize the available knowledge, identifying the current lack of research on the integration of these themes, the authors did not focus on types of OCSs, nor the relation of OCs with the benefits of corporate sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also conducted an SLR on organizational capabilities and sustainability, but their focus was on eco-innovation. Thus, this evidence demonstrates the advancement and contribution of this paper concerning the previous literature. Third, the findings may assist firms in improving their strategic OC, especially those responsible for CSB, enhancing sustainability performance consistent with the environmental and social.\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\nchanges. Finally, the paper allows a better understanding of obtaining different benefits of corporate sustainability through specific capabilities of the company, regarding the business strategy point of view.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, section 2 presents the research methodology. Section 3 presents a general overview on OCS literature. Section 4 presents the integrative framework that relates to OCS with CSB.
