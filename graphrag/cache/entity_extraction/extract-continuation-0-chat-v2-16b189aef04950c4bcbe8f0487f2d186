Hence, this study further uses average heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) to calculate the correlation ratio between the four facets of EEP, EGC, GSV, and GPPO. The overall result shows that it meets the standard value (all less than 0.85), so this study has good discriminative validity (see Table 4). A constructâ€™s convergent validity is acceptable if its AVE is greater than 0.5. The AVEs of GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP were 0.688, 0.726, 0.736, and 0.628, respectively, which are greater than 0.5. Thus, the constructs considered in this study had suitable convergent validity. Besides, Bagozzi and Yi [90] pointed out that the R-square of the observation variable is >0.5, which means that each observation variable is suitable for measuring each potential variable (Table 3). The aforementioned results indicated that the measurements in this study had acceptable validity and reliability.\n\n# 4.2. Structural Model Results\n\nThe analysis of moment structure and structural equation modeling were performed to test the research hypotheses. The structural modeling results are presented in Figure 3. According to the results, the full model had an acceptable fit (NFI = 0.951, CFI = 0.968, GFI = 0.928, and RMSEA = 0.061). GSV exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = âˆ’0.504), EEP (p &lt; 0.01, standardized direct effect = 0.148; Figure 3), and GPPO (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.426). GPPO exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = âˆ’0.37) and EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.452). Moreover, EGC exhibited a direct effect on EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = âˆ’0.307). The study results indicated that H1, H3, H4, H5, and H7 were supported. Thus, GSV has a direct and positive effect on GPPO, EGC, and EEP. GPPO has a direct and significant relationship with EGC and EEP, and EGC has a direct effect on EEP. According to Baron and Kenny [91], who verified the mediating effects, GPPO partially mediates the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP.\n\n|EGCO2|EGCO}|EGC04| | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |EGCOI|0.875|0.881\"|0.837\"|EGCOS|\n| | |0.8397|EGCO6|0.856| |\n| | |0.859\"\"| |Employee green confusion (EGC)| |\n|GSTO1|GSVO2|0.504-|HI|GPPOO2| |\n|6|-0.370|0.7480/765\"|0.882\"|H4| |\n|GPPOO1|H30.426\"|0.86|Green Product|Psychological Ownership| |\n|(GSI)|0.895|0.8137|F6|H5| |\n|0.898'|H2|0.148|GPPOO}|0.4527| |\n|GST03|GSI0+| |Employee environmental|performance (EEP)| |\n|EEPO1| |0.811|0.818|0.753\"| |\n|EEPO2| |EEPO3|EEPO4| | |\n\nChi-square/df = 2.764, GFI 0.928, RMSEA 0.061, NFI 0.951, and CFI 0.968.

Full model results.\n\nTo ensure preciseness, we performed a percentile bootstrap procedure and a deviation correction percentile bootstrap procedure 5000 times with a 95% confidence interval to examine two mediating models [92]. According to the advice of Preacher and Hayes [93], we calculated the confidence interval of the upper and lower bounds to verify whether the indirect effects were significant. The bootstrap test results presented in Table 5 indicated that GPPO partially mediated the relationship between GSV and EGC (standard indirect effect = âˆ’0.145, Z = 4.394, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval) and between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.141, Z = 4.7, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval). Thus, hypotheses 6a and 6b were confirmed. After exploring the indirect effects of the variables of the structural model, we further examined the obtained data and found two unexpected intermediary relationships: (1) the mediation effect of EGC on the relationship between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.113, Z = 2.216, Z &gt; 1.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EGC is a construct used in the study to measure employee green confusion, which relates to how employees perceive environmental initiatives within organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GSV is a construct in the study that represents green supply chain visibility, indicating how well organizations can track and manage their environmental impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPPO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPPO stands for Green Product Psychological Ownership, a construct that measures how ownership perceptions of green products affect consumer behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EEP refers to Employee Environmental Performance, which assesses how well employees perform in relation to environmental initiatives and practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>EGC<|>GSV has a direct effect on EGC, indicating that higher visibility in green supply chains influences employee perceptions of environmental initiatives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>GPPO<|>GSV has a direct and positive effect on GPPO, suggesting that better supply chain visibility enhances psychological ownership of green products<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>EEP<|>GSV has a direct effect on EEP, showing that improved visibility in green supply chains positively impacts employee environmental performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPPO<|>EGC<|>GPPO partially mediates the relationship between GSV and EGC, indicating that psychological ownership influences how employees perceive green initiatives<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPPO<|>EEP<|>GPPO has a direct effect on EEP, suggesting that psychological ownership of green products enhances employee environmental performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGC<|>EEP<|>EGC has a direct effect on EEP, indicating that employee perceptions of green initiatives influence their environmental performance<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
