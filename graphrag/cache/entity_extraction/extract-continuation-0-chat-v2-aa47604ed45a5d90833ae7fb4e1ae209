In contrast, a heterogeneous identity (Gioia, Schultz, & Corley, 2000; Pratt & Foreman, 2000) admits more diverse aspects and, thus, makes ambivalent evaluations more likely (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Organizations with heterogeneous conceptualizations of their central, distinctive, and enduring features accommodate multiple interpretations (Gioia et al., 2000) and tend to have more complex relationships with a wide spectrum of external stakeholders (Brickson, 2005). In such organizations decision makers are more likely to integrate conflicting sustainability aspects in their issue evaluations, because their organization’s identity allows for attending to a wide variety of competing stakeholder demands (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009).\n\n# Proposition 5a:\n\nDecision makers in organizations with a homogeneous business identity are less likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on interpretation.\n\n# Proposition 5b:\n\nDecision makers in organizations with a heterogeneous identity are more likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on interpretation.\n\nGiven the role of resource availability as an important contextual factor in strategic issue diagnosis (Dutton & Duncan, 1987), we expect resource constraints to also moderate the influence of cognitive frames on the interpretation of sustainability issues. Resource constraints influence both managerial sense of control and issue valence. In cases where “resources are abundant, decision makers are more likely to feel a sense of control . . . with respect to an issue, than when organizational resources are limited” (Denison, Dutton, Kahn, & Hart, 1996: 459), because they have the means available to deal with the issue adequately (Jackson & Dutton, 1988). In contrast, with limited resources, decision makers feel constrained by their context in the choices they can make and, thus, experience a loss of control (George et al., 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988). A lack of resources also makes ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues less likely, since managers tend to lack the time and resources to investi-\n\n476 Academy of Management Review October\n\ngate a greater diversity of aspects of the issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2010).\n\nWe expect that resource constraints will particularly influence the interpretation of sustainability issues under a paradoxical frame. Having only a moderate sense of control to start with, decision makers’ sense of control will be further reduced by resource constraints, since these individuals lack time and resources to process the broad range of aspects they perceive. In addition, in times of economic distress, financial aspects are more likely to come to the fore owing to increased shareholder pressure. This will reduce managers’ leeway to consider a wider range of environmental and social aspects that potentially conflict with financial performance. Managers will therefore be forced to take sides and interpret sustainability issues less ambivalently. However, they will feel that this more univalent interpretation is imposed on them rather than being the result of their own reasoning, which will further reduce their sense of control. In contrast, when managers with a business case frame operate under resource constraints, they will still seek univalent interpretations. Resource constraints tend to reinforce their reliance on routine procedures to ascertain the business relevance of sustainability issues in order to maintain control (George et al., 2006). Hence, resource constraints will affect such managers to a lesser degree. They will continue to settle univalently for either positive or negative evaluations, even with a low sense of control (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). We therefore suggest the following relationship between resource availability and managerial interpretation of sustainability issues (see the dotted curve in Figure 3).\n\n# Proposition 6:\n\nA lack of time and resources will induce decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a lower sense of control over sustainability issues and to interpret sustainability issues more univalently but will not affect the interpretation of decision makers with a business case frame.\n\n# Responding\n\nOnce managers have interpreted ambiguous sustainability issues based on their cognitive frame, they will act on that basis. While the cognition of an individual decision maker alone will not determine organizational responses to sustainability issues, we expect that different cognitive frames will lead managers to adopt different decision-making stances. We define stance as a decision maker’s rationalized mental attitude toward an issue, which predisposes the individual to act in certain ways. We argue that the different effects we expect for the two frames with regard to depth and breadth of scanning (Mazutis, 2013) and issue interpretation in terms of sense of control and issue valence (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; Plambeck & Weber, 2009) will result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues—that is, either a pragmatic stance or prudent stance. We further characterize these two stances by discussing the scope, novelty, swiftness, and riskiness (Plambeck & Weber, 2009) these different types of responses entail.\n\nAs developed above, managers with a business case frame focus in detail on selected aspects of sustainability issues to understand their relevance for economic objectives. Based on focused search routines, they develop a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they perceive and tend to evaluate these issues univalently as either clearly positive or negative for their business. Consequently, we expect these managers to consider responses that either actively approach an issue—in the case of a positive evaluation—or actively avoid it—in the case of a negative evaluation (Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). To develop these responses, they refer to existing solutions that have been successfully applied to similarly interpreted issues (Ocasio, 1997): they “access common solutions when faced with common situations that are clearly positive or negative” (Plambeck & Weber,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GIOIA<|>PERSON<|>Gioia is a researcher who has contributed to the understanding of organizational identity and stakeholder relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHULTZ<|>PERSON<|>Schultz is a researcher known for work on organizational identity and its implications for stakeholder engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORLEY<|>PERSON<|>Corley is a researcher who has studied the complexities of organizational identity and stakeholder relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLAMBECK<|>PERSON<|>Plambeck is a researcher focused on sustainability issues and their interpretation within organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBER<|>PERSON<|>Weber is a researcher who has explored the relationship between organizational identity and sustainability interpretations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAMILTON<|>PERSON<|>Hamilton is a researcher who has examined the role of organizational identity in stakeholder management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTTON<|>PERSON<|>Dutton is a researcher known for contributions to strategic issue diagnosis and organizational behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENISON<|>PERSON<|>Denison is a researcher who has studied the impact of resource availability on organizational decision-making.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAHN<|>PERSON<|>Kahn is a researcher who has contributed to understanding the dynamics of organizational control and resource management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE<|>PERSON<|>George is a researcher who has explored the effects of resource constraints on managerial decision-making.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Academy of Management Review is a scholarly journal that publishes research on management and organizational studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability issues refer to challenges and considerations organizations face regarding environmental and social impacts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIOIA<|>SCHULTZ<|>Gioia and Schultz have collaborated on research related to organizational identity and stakeholder relationships<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIOIA<|>CORLEY<|>Gioia and Corley have worked together on studies concerning organizational identity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHULTZ<|>CORLEY<|>Schultz and Corley have contributed to the field of organizational identity research<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLAMBECK<|>WEBER<|>Plambeck and Weber have researched the interpretation of sustainability issues within organizations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAMILTON<|>GIOIA<|>Hamilton has built upon Gioia's work regarding organizational identity and stakeholder management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUTTON<|>DENISON<|>Dutton and Denison have both studied the influence of resource availability on organizational decision-making<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENISON<|>KAHN<|>Denison and Kahn have collaborated on research regarding organizational control and resource management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE<|>DUTTON<|>George and Dutton have both explored the effects of resource constraints on managerial decision-making<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES<|>The Academy of Management Review publishes research articles that often address sustainability issues in organizations<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
