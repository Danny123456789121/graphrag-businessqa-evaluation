Note: Table 2 outlines the first-order meta-analytical results based on extracted statistics for primary studies from m = 25 meta-studies (second-order omnibus meta-analysis). The additional index (1) is introduced to differentiate these first-order meta-analytical results from second-order results. The significance values are: *p < 0.10; **p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.01.\n\n© 2018 The Authors. Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nCorp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 2018\n\nDOI: 10.1002/csr\n\nT. Busch and G. Friede disattenuated correlations in the meta-analyses in our sample of 0.042 (Table 1). The effects are very heterogeneous [Q(1) = 4733 to 9288 and I2 = 0.88 to 0.94].\n\nSecond, the aggregation of all summary effects of the meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25) uncovers effect sizes that are very similar to those in the sample of primary studies. We determine an attenuated correlation of r̿ = 0.108 and a disattenuated correlation of pb̿ = 0.150 (Table 3).\n\nThird, the correlations change marginally when the sample of 129 sub-effects from the meta-analyses is aggregated (r̿ = 0.110, pb̿ = 0.157). But unlike effect sizes, (true) variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those in the omnibus analysis of primary studies. Second-level variances are only in the range of σb²r̿ = 0.001 to b2b̿ = 0.007 (Table 3). The 95% credibility interval for disattenuated sub-effects ranges from -0.001σp to 0.316. Moreover, in our second-order results, we cannot detect the large heterogeneity of effects anymore that was present in the primary studies. Q and I2 indicate homogeneous relations (Q = 11.4 to 75.5; I2 = 0.00; Table 3).\n\nThe third and preferred measure of heterogeneity for psychometric meta-analysis (1-ProVar) still indicates heterogeneity (0.96 to 0.97) – albeit in very small variances, which have low statistical power.\n\nWe conclude that all CSP-CFP summary effects, be it first or second order, are highly significant positive. Second-order level variances are furthermore very small with credibility intervals that only by a very thin margin include zero and with effect sizes that are relatively homogeneous.\n\nWith respect to Hypothesis 1b, the difference between prior CSP to subsequent CFP (ri = 0.090) vs prior CFP to subsequent CSP (r = 0.098) is small and non-significant (Table 4). We apply two layers of corrections to account for other artifacts besides first-order sampling error. Based on the first-order correction for other artifacts, the relation changes slightly (pbi = 0.128 vs pbi = 0.141). The additional correction for second-order sampling error reveals that the real grand mean correlation is marginally different (pbir = 0.130 vs pbir = 0.143). The difference between both groups fails, with a wide margin, any significance level. We, thus, can rule out that the slack resources hypothesis or the good management hypothesis yields significantly higher results. However, we find the strongest correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, which supports Hypothesis 1b that there is a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP. The mean correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, corrected for second-order sampling error, is pbir = 0.159, the highest of the group with the lowest variance.\n\n|m|km|Nm|r|S2r|b2r|σ|StdE|CI95% L|CI95% U|CrI95% L|CrI95\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. focusing on corporate social responsibility and environmental management issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T.
