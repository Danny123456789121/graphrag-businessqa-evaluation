Summary statistics of time-series and cross-sectional regressions for 55 size-value and industry portfolios under the primary specification\n\nPanel A summarizes time-series regressions to explain monthly excess returns on 55 size-value and industry portfolios. Panel A provides the average absolute value of the intercepts (|Alpha|), the average adjusted R² (AVG R²), and the GRS F-test statistic (GRS). Panel B reports the Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass OLS regressions with 55 size-value and industry portfolios as the test assets. γ is the estimated risk premium associated with each factor. tEIV and tMIS are the Shanken (1992) errors-in-variables robust t-ratio and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) misspecification robust t-ratio, respectively. We also report the OLS cross-sectional adjusted R². The models are:\n\n- CAPM: \\( r_{it} = \\alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + \\epsilon_{it} \\)\n- FF: \\( r_{it} = \\alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + sSMB_{ti} + hHML_{ti} + \\epsilon_{it} \\)\n- CAPM+TSF: \\( r_{it} = \\alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + fTSF_{ti} + \\epsilon_{it} \\)\n- FF+TSF: \\( r_{it} = \\alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + sSMB_{ti} + hHML_{ti} + fTSF_{ti} + \\epsilon_{it} \\)\n\nwhere \\( r_{it} \\) is the excess return on asset i in period t, and MKT is the excess market return, SMB is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of small stocks and big stocks, HML is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of high book-to-market (value) stocks and low book-to-market (growth) stocks, and TSF is the tracking portfolio returns of changes in expectations about temperature changes from equation (4).\n\n# Panel A: Time-series regression summary statistics\n\n| ||Alpha||AVG R²|GRS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|CAPM|0.19|0.66|3.58*|\n|FF|0.15|0.75|3.13*|\n|CAPM+TSF|0.17|0.70|2.81*|\n|FF+TSF|0.14|0.76|2.72*|\n\n# Panel B: Cross-sectional regression summary statistics\n\n| |γ|tEIV|tMIS|p bootstrap|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|CAPM Constant|0.85|3.92|3.88| |\n|MKT|-0.12|-0.42|-0.42|[0.48]|\n|R²|-0.01| | | |\n|FF Constant|0.96|4.45|4.37| |\n|MKT|-0.30|-\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
