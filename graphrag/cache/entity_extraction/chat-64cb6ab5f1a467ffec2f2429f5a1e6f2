Finally, as illustrated by the Danone example, CSR initiatives may lead to new business models and offer completely new sources of value creation (Hart & Christensen, 2002; Hart & Sharma, 2004). Therefore:\n\n# Hypothesis 4:\n\nThe CSRâ€“CFP relationship is mediated by innovation capacity: CSR is positively related to innovation capacity, and innovation capacity is positively related to CFP.\n\nDoes our current knowledge allow an exhaustive conceptualization of Strategic CSR? Thus far, we have theoretically unveiled and articulated four broad empirical mechanisms through which prior empirical research has suggested CSR to improve CFP. We propose that\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nthese four mechanisms identify the four causally relevant properties of Strategic CSR. In developing explanatory concepts in social science, it is not only important to incorporate the available knowledge about a phenomenon into its conceptual understanding, but also to establish whether this understanding is more or less complete in terms of accounting for the available empirical evidence. Methodologically, this implies assessing whether the four empirical mechanisms identified thus far fully mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP. If not, the implication is that there is at least one alternative causal path connecting CSR and CFP, which is currently absent from our theorizing. To determine whether the current conceptualization of Strategic CSR is indeed exhaustive, we therefore tentatively hypothesize that the CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by the four empirical mechanisms identified above:\n\n# Hypothesis 5:\n\nThe CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity.\n\n# METHODS\n\n# Sample and coding\n\nWe used five search strategies to identify CSR-CFP studies. First, we read review articles (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams et al., 2006) and prior meta-analyses (Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2007; Orlitzky, 2015). Second, we examined six electronic databases: (1) ABI/INFORM Global, (2) Business Source Premier, (3) JSTOR, (4) Google Scholar, (5) ECONLIT, and (6) SSRN, using search terms such as: â€˜corporate social responsibilityâ€™, â€˜corporate social performanceâ€™, â€˜ethical investmentâ€™, and â€˜green investment fund.â€™ Third, we manually searched 15 leading journals in management and finance, including: Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Corporate Finance, Journal of Management Studies, and Strategic Management Journal. Fourth, we emailed all researchers who had written empirical studies.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\npapers on CSR and CFP with missing effect-size information, asking them for a correlation table and any studies we could not retrieve by other means. Finally, using a two-way â€˜snowballingâ€™ technique, we backward-traced all references reported in the identified articles and forward-traced all articles that cited the original articles via Google Scholar. These five search strategies yielded a final sample of 344 primary studies. Of these, 296 were published journal articles and 48 were working papers at the time of our analysis. The publication window ranged from 1978 to 2016.\n\nWe then developed a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) for extracting effect size and sample size information for all the variables in our study, including dependent, independent, mediator, and control variables. One author coded all effect sizes. To assess inter-rater agreement, a second rater coded a subsample of 200 randomly selected effect sizes, after which we computed a chance agreement-corrected measure of inter-rater reliability (Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient; Cohen, 1960). With a value of 0.90, kappa signified high inter-rater agreement (cf. Van Essen, Otten, & Carberry, 2015; Klier, Schwens, Zapkau, & Dikova, 2017).\n\n# Measurement\n\nTable 1 provides a description of all our variables. Existing studies have used many different measures for CSR, including both composite indices and single-item measures such as emission reductions (e.g. King & Lenox, 2002) or philanthropic donations (e.g. Zhang, Rezaee, & Zhu, 2010). We included all CSR measures in our study. CFP is operationalized using accounting-based measures such as Return on Equity (ROE) or Return on Assets (ROA), or market-based measures such as Tobinâ€™s Q or market-to-book ratio. To measure firm reputation we included both third-party assessments such as expert ratings and firm expenditures on reputation building (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Stakeholder reciprocation has not been measured before.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nIn primary studies, so we constructed this measure by capturing any manifestation of positive reciprocal behavior by stakeholders (Bosse & Phillips, 2016), such as employee commitment, customer satisfaction, and the involvement of government, institutional, or inside investors in the firmâ€™s ownership structure. Firm risk was typically measured as variability in financial performance (e.g. Jensenâ€™s beta or the standard deviation of stock returns). To capture innovation capacity we used both generic measures, such as the fraction of R&D expenses over sales, as well as more CSR-specific ones, such as the degree of environmental innovativeness.\n\nWe include several control variables in our analysis. We include prior CFP, since research has shown that this variable affects CSR through the mechanism of organizational slack, as well as current CFP through momentum effects (Waddock & Graves, 1997). We control for firm size, as\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
