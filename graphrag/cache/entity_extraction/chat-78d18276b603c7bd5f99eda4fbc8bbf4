Therefore, the standardisation and the regulations of corporate sustainability in China are in a great need of development (Bai et al., 2015).\n\n# 2.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines in China\n\nIn China, the GRI (2013) guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reportings. In recent decades, GRI has attempted to provide comprehensive guidelines for CSD by setting indicators in corporate economic, environmental and social sustainability (Chauvey et al., 2015). Firms that adopt GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines need to report their strategy in the company profiles, explain their management approach as to how they address corporate sustainability practices and disclose their company sustainability (economic, environmental and social) performance (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). GRI, overall, provides companies with information on how and what to report in CSD.\n\nWhile GRI provides such comprehensive sets of guidelines on CSR, it ultimately aims to enhance companies’ information transparency and overall accountability. This has elevated the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to become the most commonly used framework internationally (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). The KPMG Questionnaire into CSR (KPMG, 2008) examined the top 250 companies listed on the Fortune Global 500 and the 100 largest firms by revenue in 22 countries. The results showed that more than 75 per cent of companies from the Fortune Global 500 and 70 per cent of the 100 largest revenue firms applied the GRI. GRI is also considered practical for firms to use as report preparers are able to self-examine their own level of corporate sustainability performance.\n\nAs suggested by Brown et al. (2009), GRI is significant in terms of its “broad range of stakeholders” approach, as well as institutionalising multi-stakeholders on reporting and accountability. However, Drori et al. (2006) indicated that GRI is mostly presented by multinational companies on a global basis and international accounting firms have large influence on standardising the guidelines. Western multinational firms, therefore, help to set the agenda on corporate sustainability reporting based on their own interests (Vigneau et al., 2015). It is suggested that “the guidelines’ lack of universal applicability creates a perceived unfairness inherent in imposing Western standards of social behaviour and associated reporting practices” (Adams and McNicholas, 2007, p. 484).\n\nNevertheless, GRI remains highly authoritative globally because of its context, language, concepts and assumptions (Brown et al., 2009). It has a significant role to highlight the importance of corporate sustainability reporting and has led to new practices of corporate sustainability and responsibility (Vigneau et al., 2015). Hopkins (2004) also contends that the GRI guidelines include some aspects of the other popular environmental and social guidelines, such as the ISO 14000 and the global Sullivan principles.\n\n# 2.3 Perceptions and motivations of sustainability in China\n\nEarly studies on the topic of perception of CSR in the Chinese context have broadly discussed the differential impact to measure CSR based on the Western and the Chinese definitions. Both Western and Chinese literature indicates that corporate sustainability is, to some degree, directly related to shareholders and companies values, as well as the need for the companies to be legitimate and ethical. Cultural differences have also created some different perceptions about corporate sustainability in the West and the East. Many studies, which were conducted in China, into Chinese culture and corporate sustainability, have explored the idea of profits from righteousness (Yi) principle, derived from Confucius.\n\nAnother stream of studies on CSR perception in China is generally focused on the potential of political interference and government intervention, and it examines the disclosure content to reveal the propensity for firms to report on government policies (Gao, 2011; Kuo et al., 2012; Li and Zhang, 2010; Marquis and Qian, 2014). Kuo et al. (2012), based on a content analysis of Chinese data obtained from CSR reports, found that environmental sensitivity and ownership structures distinguish corporate environmental disclosures. Sensitive industries and government-owned firms are found to be more committed to providing environmental disclosures than less-sensitive industries and non-government-owned firms. They were also highly engaged in energy saving, carbon reduction, research and application of new techniques – beneficial activities that assist China in dealing with the global warming issue. Kuo et al.’s (2012) study also suggested that the Chinese government has an important role in promoting corporate CSR engagement.\n\nMarquis and Qian (2014) examined corporate strategic response to government signals through CSR disclosure. They examined 1,600 listed firms between 2006 and 2009, and their results supported the findings of Kuo et al. (2012) that the Chinese government’s signalling is a critical driver for corporate reporting, particularly for the SOEs that exert substantial political influence. Further, they found that the reporting companies are highly subjective to decoupling risk under specific monitoring mechanism. The expectation of policymakers drove the reported CSR practices.\n\nGao (2011) found that the listed companies in the Chinese financial market had, overall, a positive attitude to engage in CSR. Specifically, they found that SOEs have a higher tendency to engage in social issues through CSR than the non-SOEs. Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.\n\nThrough a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”.
