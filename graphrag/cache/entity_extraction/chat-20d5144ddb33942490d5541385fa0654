The proportion of these working papers within the total results was notably high. They contributed 28 of the 129 sub-effects. All checks revealed that the results are very likely not be affected by publication bias (Figure 1; Table 5).\n\n# Robustness Checks\n\nThe empirical outcomes of this analysis can be considered as fairly robust for a number of reasons. First, we analyzed the impact of switching from our best-effort variances to simple variance estimates (calculation according to Equation 6 in Online Supplement). The results in Table 6 show that our best-effort variances are conservative estimates, which produce lower effect sizes and variances, in particular for disattenuated results. Second, we performed a sensitivity analysis (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Joo, 2013; Greenhouse & Iyengar, 2009) and recalculated all effects when leaving out the top 5% and bottom 5%, each for effect size and effect size variances. Third, to control for a potential bias through perceptual measures of CFP and CSP, the effects were recalculated by leaving out the complete sample of perceptual CFP and reputational CSP. The results of all three robustness checks indicate that the findings are not distorted by outliers (Table 6).\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

Funnel plot of meta-analyses’ sub-effects (m = 129) against disattenuated effect size.\nNote: Figure 1 scatters the study size of the 129 meta-analysis sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p. Effects of published and unpublished studies are displayed separately. The intersection of the axes was moved to the simple average of disattenuated effect sizes (0.179). The effects are relatively symmetrically distributed around the average effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). The larger the number of effects k, the closer the effect sizes are expected to be around the population mean. Effect sizes of unpublished research do not indicate any suppression of unfavourable studies. Apart from a very few outliers, which are additionally accounted for in the Robustness Checks section, the sample is not distorted by publication bias. This visually derived conclusion is supported by the Egger test (Egger et al., 1997) with a calculated p-value for bias of 0.489.

First, the second-order omnibus meta-analysis, which is technically a first-order meta-analysis with n (1) = 551 primary studies, reveals a highly significant (first-order) effect size of ð = 0.119 (Table 2). This number presents the weighted average correlation across all primary studies adjusted for sampling error. When we additionally adjust for meta-analytic artifacts (measurement error for the CSP and CFP figures), we find a disattenuated correlation of p = 0.169. The average effect is highly significant and different from zero. The 95% confidence intervals for this weighted average attenuated correlation range from 0.105 to 0.134 (0.150 to 0.189 for the disattenuated). The 95% credibility interval ranges from -0.206 to 0.444 (-0.284 to 0.624 for the disattenuated). The corresponding variance σ²p of 0.054 (Table 2) is fairly comparable to the simple average of\n\n|n(1)|N(1)|r₁(1)|S²r₁(1)|σ²r₁(1)|StdE(1)|CI95% L₁|CI95% U₁|CrI95% L₁|CrI95% U₁|1-ProVar(1)|I²(1)|Q(1)|Fail-Safe N(1)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|551|152,437|0.119***|0.032|0.027|0.008|0.105|0.134|-0.206|0.444|0.89|0.88|4,733***|164,294|\n\n|n(1)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |N(1)|b₁|p(1)|S²b(1)|p₁|bp₁|σ²b(1)|StdE(1)|CI95% L₁|CI95% U₁|CrI95% L₁|CrI95% U₁|1-ProVar(1)|I²(1)|Q(1)|Fail-Safe N(1)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|551|152,437| |0.169***| |0.060| |0.054|0.010|0.150| |0.189| |-0.284| |0\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
