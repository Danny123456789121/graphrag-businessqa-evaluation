Further, it was observed that the delivery time of goods supplies has been drastically disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, organizations need to develop a sustainable delivery system like just-in-time (JIT), which provides a more resilient solution during any emergency faced by the organization. Economic sustainability, governance, and natural environment and climate took their position after the pandemic attribute. Whereas product responsibility came last and observed the least essential attributes by obtaining the lowest weight (0.0492). The 45 sub-attributes of the study were evaluated through with the help of expert’s opinion, according to the pairwise comparisons matrix.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Corporate governance report\n\n# Corporate Governance\n\n- Structure and dynamics of corporate governance\n- Corporate award and recognition\n- Management and audit of corporate governance\n- Corporate governance accountability\n- Conflict of interest in corporate governance\n- Public Private Partnership on sustainability\n\n# Product Responsibility\n\n# Transparency and Communication\n\n# Ranking/Evaluation of Economics Sustainable Corporate Sustainability\n\n# Environmental\n\n# Social\n\n# Natural Environment & Climate\n\n# Energy consumption and saving\n\n# Pandemic\n\n- Personal impacts of product use\n- Indirect impacts of product\n- Compliance with products and policies\n- Product research and development\n- Product complaint mechanism\n- Diversity of constituent MSS\n- Different structure of individual MSS\n- Misunderstanding of integration concepts\n- Reduced flexibility after integration\n- Increase in bureaucracy due to intertwining\n- Development and impact of infrastructure investments\n- CSR and sustainability activities expenditure\n- Economic and financial policy and strategy\n- Risks and management of economic performance\n- Economic and financial statements\n- Legal compliance with economic and financial aspects\n- Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n- Scope, and dissemination of environmental policy\n- Environmental management and responsibility\n- Compliance with environmental regulations\n- Environmental cost saving operations\n- Commitment to societal development\n- Labor relations and with society\n- Supplier management and resolution of society's demands\n- Training employees through in-house programs\n- Commitment to HR development\n- Initiatives to reduce energy consumption\n- Investing in renewable energy\n- Energy saving policies\n- Energy use efficiency\n- Emergency response plan\n- Commitment to employee safety\n- Just-in-time (JIT) and lean delivery\n- Social distancing and modification in working hours\n\n# Figure 6. Hierarchal Structure of Corporate Sustainability\n\n# The Prioritizing of Sub-Attributes\n\nThe ranking of sub-attributes of corporate sustainability is presented in Figures 7–15.\n\n# Governance sub-attributes:\n\nWe identified the sub-attributes ranking (GOV) as following:\n\nGOV4 > GOV1 > GOV3 > GOV7 > GOV5 > GOV2 > GOV6.\n\nManagement and audit of corporate governance (GOV4) obtained the highest score (0.4132) and is considered the main influencing sub-attribute of its category. The outcome proved that face validity is an accurate justification as audit expertise, then skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions.\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nSkilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses must address governance and strengthening it since governance is responsible for guiding companies towards sustainability. Another high score observed with sub-criteria in this category is the corporate governance report (GOV1), with a weight of 0.3884. Corporate award and recognition (GOV3) showed a score of 0.3732, standing at the top-three most important sub-criteria of this category (as seen in Figure 7). Investors are evaluating both economic and financial returns on investments (ROI), but the valuation of investees' reputation is increasing. Then, reputation is positively influenced by corporate sustainability governance at high standards (Gottschalk, 2011). Public Private Partnership on sustainability (GOV7) received a score of 0.2351, putting this sub-attribute at the fourth position of most important sub-attributes. Moreover, corporate governance accountability (GOV5) showed a score of 0.1717, being the fifth most important sub-attribute in this category. The structure and dynamics of corporate governance (GOV2) and conduct and conflict of interest in corporate governance (GOV6) are the least influencing sub-criteria, obtaining the weights of 0.1653 and 0.1089, respectively. The decision for a given company for engaging corporate sustainability governance depends on the achievements of the corporate goals. In this way, [97] underlined that a company’s sustainability is influenced by the stakeholder’s sustainability. Additionally, relations with stakeholders must be considered key for decision-making processes which, in turn, support the establishment of corporate strategies.\n\n|Conflict of interest in corporate governance-GOV6|0.1089|\n|---|---|\n|Structure and dynamics of corporate governance-GOV2|0.1653|\n|Corporate governance accountability-GOV5|0.1717|\n|Public Private Partnership on sustainability-GOV7|0.2351|\n|Corporate award and recognition-GOV3|0.3732|\n|Corporate governance report-GOV1|0.3884|\n|Management and audit of corporate governance-GOV4|0.4132|\n\nFigure 7.
