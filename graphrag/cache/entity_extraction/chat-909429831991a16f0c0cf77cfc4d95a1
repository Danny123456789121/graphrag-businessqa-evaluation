Uniqueness lies in the fact that HRM professionals can focus on the things that really matter but are also difficult to dehumanize through ChatGPT. The very fact that HR professionals know both the internal and external context of their organization will enable them to adapt and customize the Chat GPT generated insights and policy texts in line with the unique context of their own organization. This implies that for HR professionals - despite openly available (re) sources - are still able to provide the organization with unique and thus organization-specific knowledge.\n\n# 2.2.4 Research agenda\n\nWe suggest a further exploration of the open resource-based view of the firm using the threefold long-term consequences – organizational effectiveness, employee well-being and societal well-being – proposed by the Harvard model to study the impact of ChatGPT on SHRM. In doing so we must first clarify the theoretical foundations, assumptions, and critical conditions of this alternative theoretical framework. Building on the threefold long-term consequences we are thinking about the following research agenda:\n\n- Collaborative innovation through ChatGPT and the impact on organizational performance in a sector or population using multiple case-study research design.\n- HRM function transformations through the application of ChatGPT in terms of both HRM practices and the HR roles and the remaining leeway for uniqueness and thus contributing to a sustained competitive advantage through SHRM.\n\n# 2.3 The Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence for HRM-Related outcomes: Analysis and Research Implications\n\nDavid Guest 16 and Vijay Pereira 21\n\nGenerative AI is the latest in a stream of developments in AI that have been characterised as reflecting a paradigm change and a distinctive stage of industrial development sometimes known as Industry 4.0. It is distinctive because it shifts the source and potentially the control of knowledge from people to machines. This has implications for management, workers and society at large to the extent that there have been calls to pause development while these implications are more fully considered (Shet & Pereira, 2021). This suggests the likely impact and outcomes of generative AI in the workplace and beyond are uncertain. It therefore offers a rich new research agenda for HRM scholars since it has the potential to affect many features of the content, processes and outcomes of HRM activity (see Pereira et al., 2023). While these elements of HRM are interrelated, in this discussion, we will focus on consideration of potential outcomes.\n\nThe central feature of generative AI, reflected for example, in ChatGPT and Bard, is the capacity to store limitless amounts of knowledge and to present it in a coherent, useable form. It can undertake a range of activities that previously required human input. It therefore offers an attractive proposition to industry by promising availability of analysed information of quality in great quantity and at much greater speed than humans can achieve.\n\nFor HRM researchers exploring outcomes of generative AI, we suggest two analytic frameworks. The first is the stakeholder approach of Beer et al., 1984 who propose that HRM should pursue the core goals of organizational effectiveness, employee well-being and societal well-being while taking into consideration a range of stakeholders such as management, shareholders, employees, government, the community and unions. One reason for this is a view that to date AI has been mainly used to promote efficiency and flexibility in the interests of shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders. Generative AI has the potential to have an impact well beyond the workplace.\n\nThe second and complementary analytic framework is found in the advocacy of Industry 5.0. Among academics, among governments such as in Japan as well as in the European Commission (Breque et al., 2021) there is a recognition that the potentially dramatic impact of Industry 4.0, including generative AI, requires a rebalancing to ensure that AI works in the interests of all at work and in society reflected in outcomes consonant with improving the quality of working life and the quality of life for citizens as a whole (Guest et al., 2022). This has led to calls for a revitalisation of a socio-technical systems perspective to ensure that developments are sufficiently human-centric (Bednar & Welch, 2020). A feature of the socio-technical approach is the recognition of organizational choice in the design of work and through this the potential to address the important outcomes of the various stakeholders (Trist et al., 1963).\n\nWith these analytic considerations in mind, we can identify some outcomes that can provide a focus for research on generative AI as it affects the core outcomes identified by Beer et al., 1984 namely organizational effectiveness, employee well-being and societal well-being. In doing so, we will consider both positive and negative potential outcomes and, mindful of the specific HR function responsibility for oversight of people management, address the features associated with Industry 5.0.\n\nIn the past, organizations have sought to gain competitive advantage by embracing new technology. There is no reason to believe that it will be any different with AI and specifically with generative AI. Seen through\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\nthe theoretical lens of the Knowledge Based View (KBV), a specific feature of the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991), we primarily perceive that organizations possess unique bundles of idiosyncratic knowledge capabilities and resources (knowledge pertaining to generative AI), that need to be managed to maximize value through its optimal deployment, whilst identifying and developing its knowledge capability and resource base for the future (Grant, 1996). Thus, the HR function can use generative AI to improve its own processes and outcomes and contribute to organizational effectiveness through more efficient processing and decision-making in a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
