On the other hand, it is certain that some of that impact will be compensated for by the demand for new professions, ranging from the extremely specialized to entry level. It is interesting to note that the jobs such as prompt engineer did not exist before the mass adoption of AI technologies.\n\n# 3. Generative AI as a disruptive technology\n\nThere are multiple business models and approaches that allow emerging technologies such as GAI, to disrupt the market. One of the strategies to disrupt the market is to identify a segment occupied by companies that overserve customers and deliver a more basic—but still relevant—product or service at a lower price point (Christensen, 2016; Christensen & Raynor, 2013). In such a model technology and automation are the factors that make such a strategy still lucrative because of cost efficiency and rapid scalability. Cost efficiency and scalability usually result from minimizing the human work required in the value chain. Various tiers of a product or service is a typical mechanism used by companies to maximize the addressable market and increase efficiency of assets. Typically the highest tier on offer would be both resource and features-intensive and include most of the human-intensive service element for a premium price. This is typical of higher margin and lower volume products. On the other hand there would also be a lower tier of the offering. The lower tier is usually highly automated (or self-service) and offering only essential value and features. Efficiency and low cost are key here. The business model has lower margins but large scale. Usually companies use the lower tiers to expand the market and then upsell to more premium tiers. Typically there would be also some intermediate service tiers.\n\nIn many industries it is feasible to imagine the introduction of a lower tier of service that could be based mainly or entirely on GAI technology providing the core value at a lower price. Such examples may include legal, financial or medical advisory, media content creation, graphics design, copywriting, interior design, customer support, etc. Such services could use humans to operate and supervise the generated content. It is quite likely that the freemium business model can be utilized here, as the basic service can be offered free of charge (or generating revenue by featuring advertisements) while the elevation to a human service would trigger a payment. This way companies\n\n# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023\n\ncould gain market share to then allow them to upsell from the GAI basic service to the premium that would be operated by humans. It is also possible to imagine specialized GAI models which are trained on specific domain knowledge data and which would specialize in some specific domain such as personal finance. In the disruptive technology model the company that currently serves its customers by offering personal finance advice at an enhanced price could now expand and offer a lower tier of such services at much lower prices and carrying a much lower cost and being able to scale better. The lower tier would be powered by a GAI engine. As The Economist (2023) also suggests GAI technology can be an efficiency booster by augmenting the human workforce. Harreis et al. (2023) in their article show how GAI technologies can be adapted in various aspects across the fashion industry value chain. In some cases GAI technology can be also used to accelerate the development of more junior staff and ensure the quality of their outcomes despite lacking experience and expert knowledge.\n\nThe above business model would only make sense under the assumption that human advisors would consistently provide better value with their service compared to the AI model. This assumption is currently valid. It should be remembered that even the best GAI models used today have a tendency to hallucinate and very confidently fabricate information when data is lacking in the model. However, when considering the pace of improvements in GAI technology and algorithms it can be assumed that in the near term the next generations of GAI models will consistently outperform humans. With that in mind it can be surmised that the GAI based service could be offered not only as a basic service but as a premium over what humans can provide. It is likely and technically feasible that knowledge operating companies such as business consultancy firms will invest in training their private, highly specialized GAI models. Such models would be trained on proprietary and confidential data. It is easy to imagine that such a model could become the most valuable asset of such a company. Taking forward the business consultancy firm example GAI technology could either support the consultants to produce the highest quality content in a reduced time (AI-assisted human consultancy or human-assisted AI consultancy). Consequently the service provided solely or augmented by such a specialized, proprietary GAI model would be a premium offering compared to a human-only consultancy.\n\nWhile it is easy and comforting from the human perspective to imagine a GAI based service offered as a lower tier it can be a matter for concern when envisioning a human-based service as more basic and inferior compared to the GAI. Just as with all other technological revolutions a mental shift is needed in traditionally human operated businesses to embrace the technology and work with and not against it. The same is true for emerging AI technologies. Also as in previous technological revolutions it will take time until the initial wave of early adoption is conquered and a broader impact on the economy.\n\n# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy\n\nis seen as Krugman (2023) suggests. Kurzweil (2005) makes a point that the S-shaped paradigm lifecycle accelerates with each technological breakthrough thus shortening its adoption time.\n\n# 4. The risks and misuses of Generative AI and influence on the economy\n\nGenerative AI technology can produce powerful tools with significant potential to assist in harmful activity if misused. So far all the known mainstream models are backed by organizations that are putting their reputation at stake in making sure their creations are not easily used to commit crimes or acts of terror.
