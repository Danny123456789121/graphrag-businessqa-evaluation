Wang et al., 2008), it is surprising that the extant meta-analyses on CSR have not examined the moderating effects of the contextual contingency on the relationship between CSR and CFP. The present study seeks to fill this void in the CSR literature.\n\nMoreover, dramatic changes have occurred in the global economy over the past several decades. Emerging economies, such as China and India, have realized a fast integration into the global economic system. But there is still a significant gap in the market development and institutional environment between developing and developed economies. Such market and institutional variations in the cross-national context may moderate the degree to which CSR can contribute to the bottom line. The authors argue here that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The authors would, therefore, expect more financial performance to be gained in developed countries than in developing countries. In recent studies, some scholars have appealed for more attention to the cross-national comparison (Campbell, 2007). But due to the shortage of multinational data, the comparative research based on different backgrounds is still rare. This article intends to fill the essential research gap that exists among CSR studies. The meta-analysis applied in this study can overcome these issues to a certain extent by integrating empirical results across diverse contexts.\n\nThe present study seeks to extend the CSR literature by addressing the moderating effect of contingency factors. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 42 studies published from 2003 to 2012 to get a statistically aggregated result of the CSR–CFP relationship. Orlitzky et al. (2003) tested the linkage of CSR and CFP through a meta-analysis of 52 studies from 1970 to\n\n# Business & Society\n\n2002, so the authors of this study searched for papers published during or after the year of 2003. In this study, the authors assume that the measurement strategy and environmental context may explain the heterogeneity of the CSR–CFP linkage. The intended objectives of this article are fourfold: (a) to provide a general relationship between CSR and CFP from accumulated research, (b) to investigate the direction of causality between CSR and CFP, (c) to examine the moderating effect of the operationalization of CSR and CFP on this linkage, and (d) to assess the moderating effect of contingency factors.\n\nThe reminder of the article comprises five additional sections. The “Theory and Hypotheses” section reviews the literature on the linkage between CSR and CFP. The role of measurement strategy and environmental context on this relationship are particularly highlighted, and with this review, the research hypotheses are proposed. The “Method” section describes the methodological approach and data for this study. The “Results” section presents the empirical results, whereas the “Discussion” section discusses and outlines the study’s contributions and implications, as well as some limitations, and suggests avenues for further research. The “Conclusion” section summarizes and concludes.\n\n# Theory and Hypotheses\n\n# The CSR–CFP Linkage\n\nCSR–CFP-negative-association. Those researchers arguing for a negative relationship between social and financial performance believe that firms that perform responsibly are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their unresponsive peers (Aupperle et al., 1985), because they impose a direct cost on the firm (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Ullmann, 1985). This point of view is mainly supported by neoclassical economic theory.\n\nAnother dominant critique of business social involvement originates from the principal–agent paradigm, which suggests that the purpose of the firm is primarily for the profit of the stockholders. Friedman (1970), the well-known critic of CSR, supposed that in responding to calls for socially responsible practices, executives take money and resources that otherwise go to stockholders and dedicate those resources to enhance their personal benefits. According to agency theory, the agents (the top management team) and the principals (the shareholders) always show a conflict of interests and objectives. Therefore, managers may act in their own best interests, but at the expense of the firm’s owners. As a result, the costs involved in agency relationships may be high and damage corporate value.\n\n# Wang et al.\n\nAlthough the enterprises may bear the direct cost and agency cost of social responsibility, they can also obtain benefits from CSR. In fact, both the academic and practical worlds have expressed more and more doubts about the point of maximization of shareholder wealth held by neoclassical economists. Recently, frequently exposed corporate scandals have gradually given rise to a wave of rethink and debate on the role of the firm to society. Especially following the global financial crisis, public concern, regulatory forces, media interest, reputation pursuit, consumer pressure, and intraindustry peer pressure have led to the prevalence of CSR on firms’ top management agendas. Actually, the value of a firm depends on the cost not only of explicit claims from shareholders but also of implicit claims from other stakeholders (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988). Besides stockholders and bondholders, other stakeholders also have implicit contracts. If corporate management fails to respond to these implicit claims, parties to implicit contracts may attempt to transform these implicit agreements into explicit agreements that will, as a result, be more costly.\n\n# CSR–CFP-positive-association\n\nInstrumental stakeholder theory, an important strand within stakeholder theory, supports the positive association between CSR and CFP. This theory suggests that firms view their stakeholders as part of an environment that must be managed to assure revenues, profits, and, ultimately, returns to shareholders (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999). Attention to stakeholder concerns may help\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
