Overall, the regression intercepts from the cross-sectional return regressions are both economically and statistically significant in the presence of various risk factors.\n\n# Panel B\n\nPanel B shows the results for the carbon premium related to the growth rate in total emissions. We find again that the set of standard risk factors cannot explain the average value of the carbon premium for any of the emissions categories. This time, however, the difference in magnitudes across specifications is much smaller.\n\n# Panel C\n\nPanel C gives the results for emission intensity. Whether unconditionally or conditionally on the risk factors, we find no significant carbon premium.\n\nOverall, our time-series regression results show that the carbon premium cannot be explained by known risk factors. This result reinforces the finding in Section 3.2 that the level of carbon emissions contains independent information about the cross-section of average returns.\n\n# 3.4. The divestment hypothesis\n\nAn important possible explanation for the observed carbon premium could be under-diversification resulting from divestment and exclusionary screening of stocks with high carbon emissions by institutional investors implementing a sustainable investment policy. To the extent that some investors may shun companies with high carbon emissions, risk sharing would be limited, and idiosyncratic risk could be priced (e.g., Merton, 1987; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). If the extent of such divestment is high, one would expect to see significant pricing effects.\n\nWe test this possibility by looking at the portfolio holdings of institutional investors. Formally, we estimate the following pooled regression model:\n\n. (3)\n\n13\n\nWe consider ownership effects based on carbon intensity, the measure that is most aligned with explicit mandates imposed by socially sensitive asset managers. In the Online Appendix, Table A.4, we also present the results for the less commonly used measures of total emissions and growth in emissions. As these results confirm, these variables have no significant impact on institutional investor portfolios. The vector of controls includes LOGSIZE, PRINV, B/M, MOM, BETA, VOLAT, VOLUME, NASDAQ, and SP500. All regressions include year/month fixed effects. Also, carbon emissions tend to vary geographically, due to resource-driven firm locations. It is thus possible that the geographic location may also interact with ownership incentives. We test this idea by including in the ownership regression state fixed effects determined by the firm headquarters’ locations (in even columns). Our coefficient of interest is [missing value], which measures the degree of avoidance of firms with greater carbon emissions. We cluster standard errors at the industry and year levels.\n\n# 3.5. Coarse Categorization\n\nIn Panel A of Table 11, we report the results for the aggregate institutional ownership measure. Columns 1 and 2 show the results for SCOPE 1 INT, respectively without and with state fixed effects. Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level. The economic effect of the divestment is relatively modest: a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 1 leads to approximately a 1.3-percentage-point decrease in aggregate institutional ownership, which is about 6.3% of the cross-sectional standard deviation in ownership. In contrast, the coefficients are statistically insignificant for SCOPE 2 INT and SCOPE 3 INT, indicating that the exclusionary screens institutional investors apply in constructing their portfolios are entirely based on SCOPE 1 INT.\n\nThe institutional investor world pools a number of different constituencies with possibly different investor pressures. We conjecture that certain institutions, such as insurance companies, investment advisers, or pension funds, are more likely to face investor pressure, and thus they avoid high-emission companies, as opposed to mutual funds and hedge funds who are natural arbitrageurs. We test this hypothesis formally by dividing the institutional investors’ universe into six categories: banks, insurance companies, investment companies, independent advisers, pension funds, and hedge funds. For each category, we obtain their stock-level institutional ownership and estimate the regression model in (3) for each of them separately. Panel B reports the results broken down by investor category. We observe a strong cross-sectional variation in the ownership patterns. Insurance companies, investment advisers, and pension funds tend to hold less of the high scope 1 emission companies. At the same time, we observe positive, though weaker, ownership effects for banks, investment companies, and hedge funds, consistent with these groups being natural arbitrageurs. The divestment effects are economically large. A movement in SCOPE 1 INT from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean, corresponding to a spread between low and high-emission firms leads to a reduction in ownership by 21%, 5%, and 4% of the cross-sectional standard deviation of ownership for investment advisers, insurance companies, and pension funds, respectively. In particular, given its large aggregate shares of stock holdings, the effect through investment advisers could lead to significant pricing effects. In sharp contrast to the results for SCOPE 1 INT, we observe that (with the exception of banks loading up positively on SCOPE 3 INT) all coefficients for the different investor types are small and statistically insignificant, which suggests that institutional investors do not seem to discriminate between stocks with regard to their scope 2 and scope 3 emission intensities.\n\nOverall, institutional investors do significantly divest from firms associated with high SCOPE 1 INT. They do not screen companies based on the level of their emissions (or growth in emissions), even though the carbon premium is associated with these variables. They prefer to screen firms based on how efficiently they use fossil fuel energy and do not seem to be concerned about reducing their exposure to the level of carbon emissions per se. We conclude from these findings that, unlike for “sin” stocks (as shown by Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009), limited risk sharing caused by divest\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CARBON PREMIUM<|>EVENT<|>The carbon premium refers to the additional return associated with investments in companies with lower carbon emissions, which is a significant topic in sustainable finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institutional investors are organizations that invest large sums of money in securities, real estate, and other investment assets, often influencing market trends and corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 1 INT<|>EVENT<|>SCOPE 1 INT refers to the direct greenhouse gas emissions from owned or controlled sources, which institutional investors consider when making investment decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 2 INT<|>EVENT<|>SCOPE 2 INT refers to indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 3 INT<|>EVENT<|>SCOPE 3 INT refers to all other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain, including both upstream and downstream emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANEL A<|>EVENT<|>Panel A presents the results for the aggregate institutional ownership measure related to carbon emissions and their impact on investment decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANEL B<|>EVENT<|>Panel B reports the results broken down by investor category, showing how different types of institutional investors respond to carbon emissions in their portfolios.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>CARBON PREMIUM<|>Institutional investors are significantly influenced by the carbon premium when making investment decisions, particularly regarding high-emission companies.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPE 1 INT<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Institutional investors tend to divest from firms associated with high SCOPE 1 INT emissions, indicating a strong relationship between emissions and investment choices.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPE 2 INT<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Institutional investors do not seem to discriminate based on SCOPE 2 INT emissions, suggesting a weaker relationship compared to SCOPE 1 INT.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPE 3 INT<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Institutional investors show little concern for SCOPE 3 INT emissions, indicating a minimal relationship in their investment strategies.<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANEL A<|>SCOPE 1 INT<|>Panel A shows the results for SCOPE 1 INT and its negative impact on aggregate institutional ownership, highlighting the relationship between emissions and ownership levels.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANEL B<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Panel B provides insights into how different categories of institutional investors respond to carbon emissions, illustrating their varied investment behaviors.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
