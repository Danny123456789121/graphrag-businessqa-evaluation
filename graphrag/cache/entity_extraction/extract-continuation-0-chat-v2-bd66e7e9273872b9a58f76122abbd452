However, it proposes a different temporal ordering — namely, that prior CFP is directly associated with subsequent CSP. Prior high levels of CFP may provide the slack resources necessary to engage in corporate social responsibility and responsiveness (Ullmann 1985; Waddock and Graves 1997). Because CSP often represents an area of relatively high managerial discretion, the initiation or cancellation of voluntary social and environmental policies may, to a large extent, depend on the availability of excess funds (McGuire et al. 1988).\n\nTo distinguish between slack resources theory and the good management theory, the meta-analytic data set will be examined for three sets of temporal associations: (a) prior CSP related to subsequent CFP; (b) prior CFP related to subsequent CSP; and (c) contemporaneous (cross-sectional) associations. If effect sizes are highly similar across all three meta-analytic subgroups, Waddock and Graves’s (1997) argument about a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP would be supported irrespective of study context, sampling error, and measurement error. Based on prior theory and empirical findings (McGuire et al. 1990; Waddock and Graves 1997), we believe that both instrumental stakeholder theory and slack resources descriptions are accurate, such that the two constructs are related to each other reciprocally.\n\n# H2:\n\nThere is bidirectional causality between corporate social performance and financial performance.\n\n# Mediating Effects\n\nCSP may be an organizational resource that provides internal or external benefits, or both. Internally, investments in CSP may help firms develop new competencies, resources, and capabilities which are manifested in a firm’s culture, technology, structure, and human resources (Barney 1991; Russo and Fouts 1997; Wernerfelt 1984). Especially when CSP is pre-emptive (Hart 1995) and a firm’s environment is dynamic or complex, CSP may help build managerial competencies because preventive efforts necessitate significant employee involvement, organization-wide coordination, and a forward-thinking managerial style (Shrivastava 1995). Thus, CSP can help management develop better scanning skills, processes, and information systems, which increase the organization’s preparedness for external changes, turbulence, and crises (for example, Russo and Fouts 1997).\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# 407\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nwhich are acquired internally through the CSP process, would then lead to more efficient utilization of resources (Majumdar and Marcus 2001). According to the ‘internal resources/learning’ perspective, whether CSP behaviours and outcomes are also disclosed to outside constituents is largely irrelevant to the development of internal capabilities and organizational efficiency.\n\nIn addition, however, CSP may have external effects on organizational reputation. According to the reputation perspective, an organization’s communication with external parties about its level of CSP may help build a positive image with customers, investors, bankers, and suppliers (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Firms high in CSP may use corporate social responsibility disclosures as one of the informational signals upon which stakeholders base their assessments of corporate reputation under conditions of incomplete information (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Furthermore, firms with high CSP reputation ratings may improve relations with bankers and investors and thus facilitate their access to capital (Spicer 1978). They may also attract better employees (Greening and Turban 2000; Turban and Greening 1997) or increase current employees’ goodwill, which in turn may improve financial outcomes (Davis 1973; McGuire et al. 1988; Waddock and Graves 1997). In sum, the reputation perspective postulates reputational effects as mediators of the CSP–CFP linkage, while the internal-resources perspective proposes managerial competencies and learning as the intervening generative mechanism between a positive CSP–CFP association. Therefore, we propose that:\n\n# H3: CSP is positively correlated with CFP because (a) CSP increases managerial competencies, contributes to organizational knowledge about the firm’s market, social, political, technological, and other environments, and thus enhances organizational efficiency, and (b) CSP helps the firm build a positive reputation and goodwill with its external stakeholders.\n\n# Measurement Strategy: An Important Moderator Variable\n\nBecause both CSP and CFP are such broad meta-constructs, a given study’s operationalization of each construct may act as an important moderator. To test this hypothesis, the entire meta-analytic set is broken down into different CFP and CSP subsets employing different measurement strategies. This breakdown can establish whether correlations between different CSP and CFP measures are similar across subgroups, or whether different operationalizations lead to systematically different effect sizes across studies. The following section gives an overview of how CFP and CSP have been measured in the past.\n\nThe three broad subdivisions of CFP consist of market-based (investor returns), accounting-based (accounting returns), and perceptual (survey) measures. First, market-based measures of CFP, such as price per share or share price appreciation, reflect the notion that shareholders are a primary stakeholder group whose satisfaction determines the company’s fate (Cochran).\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n# 24(3)\n\nThe bidding and asking processes of stock-market participants, who rely on their perceptions of past, current, and future stock returns and risk, determine a firm’s stock price and thus market value.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Performance (CSP) refers to a company's commitment to conducting business in an ethical way, considering its impact on society and the environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Financial Performance (CFP) measures a company's financial health and profitability, often assessed through metrics like revenue, profit margins, and return on investment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WADDOCK AND GRAVES<|>PERSON<|>Waddock and Graves are researchers who proposed a virtuous cycle between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ULLMANN<|>PERSON<|>Ullmann is a researcher who contributed to the understanding of the relationship between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCGUIRE<|>PERSON<|>McGuire is a researcher who has studied the connections between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARNEY<|>PERSON<|>Barney is a researcher known for his work on organizational resources and capabilities in relation to Corporate Social Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSO AND FOUTS<|>PERSON<|>Russo and Fouts are researchers who have explored the relationship between Corporate Social Performance and organizational efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHRIVASTAVA<|>PERSON<|>Shrivastava is a researcher who has discussed the importance of managerial competencies in relation to Corporate Social Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRENING AND TURBAN<|>PERSON<|>Greening and Turban are researchers who studied the impact of Corporate Social Performance on employee attraction and retention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICER<|>PERSON<|>Spicer is a researcher who has examined the relationship between Corporate Social Performance and access to capital.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Corporate Social Performance is believed to positively influence Financial Performance through various mechanisms such as reputation and managerial competencies.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WADDOCK AND GRAVES<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Waddock and Graves proposed a virtuous cycle where Corporate Social Performance enhances Financial Performance and vice versa.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ULLMANN<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Ullmann's research supports the idea that prior Financial Performance can lead to better Corporate Social Performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCGUIRE<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>McGuire's studies indicate that Corporate Social Performance can be influenced by prior Financial Performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARNEY<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Barney's work suggests that Corporate Social Performance can enhance organizational capabilities and efficiency.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSO AND FOUTS<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Russo and Fouts argue that Corporate Social Performance contributes to organizational efficiency and preparedness.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHRIVASTAVA<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Shrivastava highlights the role of Corporate Social Performance in developing managerial competencies.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRENING AND TURBAN<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Greening and Turban found that Corporate Social Performance positively affects employee attraction and retention.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICER<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Spicer's research indicates that Corporate Social Performance can improve access to capital for firms.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
