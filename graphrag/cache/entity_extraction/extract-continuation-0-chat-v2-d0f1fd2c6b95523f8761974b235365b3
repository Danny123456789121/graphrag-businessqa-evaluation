Accounting-based measures include financial ratios such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), or earnings per share (EPS). Market-based measures include market value, market return, and Tobin’s Q.\n\n# II. THEORY, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT\n\nThis section provides a literature review of studies and theories related to corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. This paper focuses on examining the relationship between performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). CSP and CFP are our two main constructs. Using the AICPA’s definition of “sustainability,” environmental performance and social performance were identified as two sub-constructs of CSP. Investors consider these two areas to be most important. For example, 83 percent of investors surveyed in 2010 by Institutional Shareholder Services said they believe environmental and social factors can have a significant impact on shareholder value over the long term (Ernst & Young [E&Y] 2011). About half of the 2011 shareholder proposals in proxy statements have centered on social and environmental issues (E&Y 2011). Figure 1 illustrates the constructs, sub-constructs, and the measurement of each sub-construct. The literature review on the relationship between sustainability performance and financial performance in the paper thus considers the link between environmental performance and financial performance and the link between social performance and financial performance.\n\nIn this meta-analysis study, the following common measures are found to be used to measure environmental performance areas, such as chemical emission reduction, waste recycling, the U.S. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) index, etc. This meta-analysis study also found the following social performance measures used in individual studies, such as social responsible ratings (i.e., KLD social ratings or Dow Jones sustainability index), concerns about issues on human rights, gender equality and product quality, accommodation for disabilities, development of heritage conservation, promotion of customer relations, corporate charity giving, and collaboration with social projects, etc. In the examined studies, financial performance uses either accounting-based or market-based measures. Accounting-based measures include financial ratios such as return on assets.\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Lu and Taylor\n\n(ROA), return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), or earnings per share (EPS). Market-based measures include market value, market return, and Tobin’s Q.\n\n# Theories\n\nUllman (1985) suggests the need for a theory of corporate social performance because of the inconsistent findings that have resulted from studies of the interrelationships among social disclosure, social performance, and economic performance of U.S. companies. Of the theories that have been employed in prior literature, there are two views and three theories that have received much attention from investors. The two views that are related to sustainability performance are the “traditionalist” view and the “revisionist” view. The three theories that are related to sustainability investment and reporting are agency theory, legitimacy theory, and stakeholder theory.\n\nThe “traditionalist” view is rooted in neo-classical theory, which posits that pollution abatement measures are predicted to increase production costs and are assumed to have increasing marginal costs (Patten 2002).\n\nThe “revisionist” view, also called the Porter hypothesis, was initiated and developed mainly by Porter (Porter and van der Linde 1995) who theorized that pollution reduction provides future cost savings by increasing efficiency, reducing compliance costs, and minimizing future liabilities (King and Lenox 2001), thus increasing firm value. For example, costs incurred to reduce pollution would send a signal to the public that the company cares about the protection of the environment and the quality of life of the community, and thus may increase the positive image of the company. In addition, investment in pollution reduction, whether voluntary or legally imposed, would make a company appear to be a socially responsible company and increase a company’s positive image. A better public image will bring a company positive benefits such as increased sales demands, less input waste in production, and less negative attention from regulators (Konar and Cohen 2001), and therefore increases the company’s financial performance.\n\nThe two views and three theories are illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nAgency theory provides a theoretical foundation for the “traditionalist” view. Agency theory as proposed by Jensen and Meckling (1976) states that one of the major functions of managers is to align companies’ interest with shareholders’ interest. Friedman (1970) used agency theory to examine companies’ activity in corporate social responsibility (CSR). Friedman (1970) asserts that engaging in CSR is symptomatic of an agency problem or a conflict between the interest of managers and shareholders. He argues that managers use CSR as a means to pursue their own social, economic, political, and career goals. According to this view, investment in CSR would be more wisely used, from a social perspective, on the improvement to a company’s efficiency. He further argues that every penny used in CSR activities is just spending somebody else’s money and does not do much good for the company as a whole. This theory represents the “traditionalist view.” Under this view, environmental costs used for environmental protection/improvement such as pollution abatement or air emission reduction are predicted to increase\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication that features research related to international accounting, including studies on corporate sustainability performance and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LU AND TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Authors of the paper discussing the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AICPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which provides a definition of sustainability used in the paper.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERST & YOUNG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A global leader in assurance, tax, transaction, and advisory services, which conducted a survey on investor beliefs regarding sustainability factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>The concept of sustainability as it relates to corporate practices and performance, including environmental and social factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>EVENT<|>A construct that encompasses environmental and social performance measures in corporate settings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>EVENT<|>A construct that measures the financial outcomes of corporate activities, often in relation to sustainability efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENCY THEORY<|>EVENT<|>A theory that explains the relationship between principals (shareholders) and agents (managers) in corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEGITIMACY THEORY<|>EVENT<|>A theory that suggests companies seek to ensure that they operate within the bounds and norms of their respective societies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDER THEORY<|>EVENT<|>A theory that posits that the interests of all stakeholders (not just shareholders) should be considered in corporate decision-making.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LU AND TAYLOR<|>JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING RESEARCH<|>Lu and Taylor authored a paper published in the Journal of International Accounting Research discussing corporate sustainability performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AICPA<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>The AICPA provides a definition of sustainability that is referenced in the context of corporate performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERST & YOUNG<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Ernst & Young conducted a survey that highlights the importance of sustainability factors to investors.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>CSP and CFP are constructs examined in the paper to understand their interrelationship.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGENCY THEORY<|>TRADITIONALIST VIEW<|>Agency theory supports the traditionalist view regarding corporate social responsibility and its impact on financial performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEGITIMACY THEORY<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Legitimacy theory is related to the concept of sustainability as companies seek to align with societal norms.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAKEHOLDER THEORY<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Stakeholder theory emphasizes the importance of considering all stakeholders in sustainability practices.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
