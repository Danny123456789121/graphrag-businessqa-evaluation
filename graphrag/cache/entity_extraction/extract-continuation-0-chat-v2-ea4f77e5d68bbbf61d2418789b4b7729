Rather, the coexistence and the interplay of different cognitive types, where some are aware of tensions but others are not, appear to play a critical role not only for the management of corporate sustainability in for-profit firms but also for the successful implementation of hybrid business models.\n\nFinally, we believe that addressing a greater cognitive diversity of managers promises considerable further insights into the nature and contingencies of managerial responses to issues other than sustainability that are also characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects and where the debate is also dominated by a business case perspective. For instance, diversity in organizations represents a complex issue that scholars and managers alike often frame as having business value (Herring, 2009; Robinson & Dechant, 1997). Here, too, business benefits are unclear (Cox & Blake, 1991), and critical voices call for approaches that go beyond business case thinking (O’Leary & Weathington, 2006). We expect that considering alternative frames on such an issue will shed new light on how and why decision makers approach diversity issues in different ways.\n\nWe propose two ideal-type cognitive frames through which individuals make sense of sustainability issues, based on different views on how economic, environmental, and social dimensions relate to each other, a key debate in corporate sustainability (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). However, we acknowledge that frames can be based on various rationales (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). Cognitive perspectives that correspond to other debates within the corporate sustainability literature will result in alternative ideal-type frames and promise further insights into the effects of frame content and structure on managerial responses to sustainability issues.\n\nWhile not being exhaustive, Table 2 offers a starting point for exploring such alternative frames. One set of frames may form around governance issues, exploring the question of who is responsible for taking action to address sustainability concerns—for example, private sector versus state (Matten & Crane, 2005; Reinhardt, Stavins, & Vietor, 2008). Other frame sets could relate to the discussion of different motivations to take action on sustainability—for example, altruism versus (enlightened) self-interest (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Jensen, 2001)—or could address the different time dimensions that are being discussed in the sustainability literature—for example, present generations versus future generations (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).\n\n# 2014\n\n# Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge\n\n# TABLE 2\n\n# Alternative Frames on Corporate Sustainability\n\n|Underlying Rationale|Potential Frames|Key References|\n|---|---|---|\n|Relationship between and among economic, environmental, and social sustainability concerns|Business case versus paradoxical|Carroll & Shabana (2010), Smith & Lewis (2011)|\n|Responsibility to act on sustainability concerns|Corporate citizenship versus state regulation|Matten & Crane (2005), Reinhardt, Stavins, & Vietor (2008)|\n|Motivation behind commitment to address sustainability concerns|Altruism versus (enlightened) self-interest|Bansal & Roth (2000), Jensen (2001)|\n|Time horizon on sustainability issues|Present generations versus future generations|Held (2001), Slawinski & Bansal (2012)|\n\nWe contribute to the discussion of alternative cognitive frames by going beyond a descriptive typology (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999) to address in detail the effects of differences in frame content and structure. However, we do not suggest that any particular frame automatically determines the sensemaking of decision makers. Rather, we expect that the effects of managers’ cognitive frames on their decision making will be moderated by a range of personal, situational, and contextual factors. We propose that the effects of the two frames on scanning and interpretation will be attenuated by the functional background of managers and by organizational identity, respectively. In addition, our argument on the availability of resources illustrates that not all frames are susceptible to contextual factors. Some cognitive constraints, as in the case of narrow scanning by business case–minded decision makers, cannot be simply overcome by providing abundant resources, whereas in other instances—for example, with the sense of control of paradoxically minded managers—resource constraints prevail over cognitive predispositions. The moderators we propose provide only an initial step toward understanding the various factors that influence the role of cognitive frames. We are aware that there are further relevant moderating factors, beyond the individual- and the organizational-level factors we address, providing ample opportunities for future research into a cognitive framing perspective on managerial sensemaking of ambiguous issues. It would be particularly fruitful to address the moderating role of institutional factors since these prime and trigger cognitive frames (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research could thus investigate how multiple, competing institutional logics (Besharov & Smith, 2014; Jay, 2013) moderate the effect of cognitive frames on sustainability decision making.\n\nAnother relevant question for future research refers to the origin of cognitive frames. Since managers’ frames “do not spring up randomly, but rather are the encoding of their prior history” (Kaplan & Tripsas, 2008: 791), we would expect that a range of factors at personal, organizational, and institutional levels will influence the formation of cognitive content and structure. With regard to personal background, researchers have argued that personality traits, such as need for closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) and tolerance for ambiguity (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), play an important role in sensemaking under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity (McKenzie,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
