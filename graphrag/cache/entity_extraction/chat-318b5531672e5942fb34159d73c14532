Instead, some possible impacts of urbanization on the environment are partially and separately discussed in three relevant theories: ecological modernization, urban environmental transition and compact city theories. The first theory focuses on impacts at the national level, while the others discuss impacts at the city level.\n\nEcological modernization theory emphasizes not only economic modernization but also social and institutional transformations in explaining the effects of modernization on the environment. In this theory, urbanization is the process of social transformation regarded as one important indicator of modernization. It is argued that environmental problems may increase from low to intermediate stages of development. However, further modernization can minimize such problems, as societies come to realize the importance of environmental sustainability, seeking to decouple environmental impact from economic growth through technological innovation, urban agglomeration, and the shift toward knowledge and service based industries (Crenshaw and Jenkins, 1996; Gouldson and Murphy, 1997; Mol and Spaargaren, 2000).\n\nThe urban environmental transition theory mainly discusses the types of urban environmental issues and their evolution. It suggests that urban environmental problems vary with respect to stages of economic development (McGranahan et al., 2001). Because of limited resources, low stages of development often face poverty-related environmental problems (lack of safe water supply and inadequate sanitation). However, as income levels rise, these problems gradually subside. The increasing wealth of cities is often accompanied by an increase in manufacturing activities, causing substantial industrial pollution-related issues (water and air pollution). Nonetheless, such problems decrease in wealthy cities as the result of improved environmental regulations, technological progress and structural change in the economy.\n\nHowever, wealthy cities are often associated with consumption-related environmental issues. Consumption patterns and lifestyles of the wealthy cities tend to be more resource intensive than those of lower-income cities. As cities become affluent, demands for urban infrastructure, transportation and individual resource consumption rise. Consequently, consumption-related issues such as energy consumption and CO2 emissions become more prominent. The three types of urban environmental issues could occur simultaneously at the same development stage (Bai and Imura, 2000; Marcotullio et al., 2003). However, the dominant issues of each stage described by this theory seem plausible.\n\nThe compact city theory mainly discusses the environmental benefits of urban compaction. The theory argues that high urban density allows cities to exploit economies of scale for urban public infrastructure (e.g., public transport, schools and water supply), and reduces car dependency, travel distance, the transmission and distribution losses of electricity supply, decreasing energy consumption and CO2 emissions (Burton, 2000; Capello and Camagni, 2000; Jenks et al., 1996; Newman and Kenworthy, 1989). However, some critics argue that increasing urban density is likely to cause traffic congestion, overcrowding and greater air pollution, which will outweigh the claimed benefits of compact cities (Breheny, 2001; Rudlin and Falk, 1999). In turn, this may increase energy use and emissions. Without adequate urban infrastructure support, greater urban density can cause substantial urban environmental issues (Burgess, 2000).\n\n# 2.2. Literature Review\n\nThe relationship between urbanization and various forms of environmental pressure, including energy consumption and CO2 emissions, has been extensively investigated in recent decades using various types of data and models at the national, city and household level. To start with, using a national level analysis with cross-sectional data, Jones (1991) derived a positive correlation between urbanization and energy use per capita, noting that while urbanization enabled cities to benefit from economies of scale in production, it increased transport energy use and energy use per unit of output. Using a STIRPAT model, York et al. (2003a,b) also found that urbanization positively affects national energy footprints and emissions. Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. (2002) examined the relationship between urbanization and deforestation rates in developing nations using the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model. The results suggested that deforestation rates increase at the early stage of urbanization, but decline as urbanization advances. This curvilinear relationship was attributed to the effects of urban agglomeration and growing service sector dominance in urban areas.\n\nIn a time-series data context, Alam et al. (2007) investigated the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in Pakistan with a model similar to the STIRPAT, and found a positive link between urbanization and emissions. Liu (2009) also found that urbanization positively influences energy use, but that the magnitude of the influence is declining. Liu (2009) attributed this decreasing influence to improvements in industrial and technological structure and more efficient utilization of resources. Similarly, Holtedahl and Joutz (2004) suggested that urbanization increases residential energy consumption for two reasons. First, moving to urban areas increases household accessibility to electricity. Second, households that had access to electricity in rural areas may increase their energy consumption after moving to urban areas by using existing electric appliances and after the purchase of new items.\n\nIn a panel data context, Parikh and Shukla (1995) showed that urbanization increases per capita energy consumption, noting that urbanization affects energy use in three ways: first, by shifting energy use from traditional fuels to modern fuels, second, by increasing embodied energy consumption through goods and service demands, and third, via direct household and transport consumption. Using the STIRPAT model, similar evidence was obtained by York (2007), who further argued that even in the most modernized nations, urbanization contributes to the growth of energy use. Following a similar model, Cole and Neumayer (2004) found that urbanization increases CO2 emissions. On the other hand, Mishra et al. (2009) reported that the relationship between urbanization and per capita energy was\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
