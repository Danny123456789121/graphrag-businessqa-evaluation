There can be differences between the two types of research since it is well known that managed funds rarely beat the market (Jensen, 1968; Ferson and Schadt, 1996; Ferson and Warther, 1996; Carhart, 1997). In addition, funds formed by researchers do not consider market frictions such as liquidity constraints and transaction costs explicitly, which is not the case in the analysis of mutual funds (Adamsson and Hoepner, 2015). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 8.\n\nESs from examining SRI mutual funds will be lower than ESs from examining portfolios formed by researchers.\n\n# 2.3. Methodological Issues\n\nEffect sizes can also vary with methodologies employed. In particular, under efficient capital markets, there should not be a performance difference between SRI and conventional portfolios if all relevant factors are considered. However, if some important determinants are omitted by methodological misspecification, it will.\n\nAlthough methodological issues exist for most asset pricing/capital market studies, they are particularly important in the meta-analysis of SRI. The result on SRI performance can be systematically different depending on the research methodologies used. Thus, investigating the impact of methodological difference on ESs from a variety of different angles can significantly enhance our understanding of SRI.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nproduce a spurious difference in portfolio performances. For instance, Gregory et al. (1997) reveal that the outperformance of UK SRI funds found in previous studies disappears when they improve methodology by using a two-factor benchmark to control size. In general, the more rigorous the methodologies, the smaller the possible confounding effects.\n\nExisting literature examines various methods of controlling for these problems, and this paper categorizes these into three groups, that is, variable adjustment (e.g. risk adjustment, value-weighting, splits and dividends adjustment), refining benchmark model (e.g. multi-factor model, conditional model), and matching.\n\n# 2.3.1. Variable adjustment.\n\nPerformance proxies in the existing literature can broadly be categorized as measures with and without risk adjustment. Raw returns are the performance measure without considering risk, while Jensen’s alpha, the Sharpe ratio, and the Treynor ratio are risk-adjusted measures. If raw returns are used even though the portfolios of SR and conventional firms have different risk profiles, there can be a spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional investment because they do not reflect proper risk factors (Becchetti and Ciciretti, 2009). Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 9-1.\n\nThe AESs will be smaller when risk-adjusted performance measures are used.\n\nWhen calculating portfolio returns, value-weighting is theoretically more appropriate than equal-weighting. Value-weighting schemes are also in accord with typical financial industry practice (Humphrey and Tan, 2014), and most feasible for institutional investors who constitute the largest proportion of the SRI market (Trinks and Scholtens, 2017). In some cases, results based on value-weighting are different from those based on equal-weighting. For example, Statman and Glushkov (2009) find that excess returns of value-weighted portfolios are lower than those of equally weighted portfolios. If SRI mutual funds have a higher exposure to small firms than conventional funds (Luther and Matatko, 1994; Schröder, 2003), equal-weighting schemes can generate undeserved performance differences between SRI and conventional portfolios. In order to examine this effect, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 9-2.\n\nThe AESs calculated using a value-weighting scheme will be smaller than those using an equal-weighting scheme.\n\nWhen calculating returns, some papers pay more attention to data accuracy by taking dividends and stock splits into account (Shank et al., 2005), whereas other papers ignore them. Inaccurate data can cause a spurious difference between SRI and conventional portfolios. For example, if SRI funds in general invest more in small firms than conventional funds (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994), ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in the performance.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\nC.-S. Kim\n\nof SRI and conventional portfolios. This is because, other things being equal, the SRI universe would have a lower dividend payout ratio than the conventional funds universe due to the higher investment opportunities of small firms over large firms. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 9-3.\n\nThe ESs will be smaller when returns are calculated reflecting stock splits and dividends.\n\n# 2.3.2. Refining benchmark model.\n\nSeveral authors examine the impact of SRI in the US market using a single-index framework (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005). However, the single-index model can produce distorted results by not controlling factors other than market portfolio. Prior literature indicates that SRI and conventional funds are different in their investment universe and portfolio strategies, having significantly different loadings on size, book-to-market, and momentum factors (Bauer et al., 2005; Renneboog et al., 2008b). In order to take into account the difference between the two types of funds, researchers use multi-factor models (Fama\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
