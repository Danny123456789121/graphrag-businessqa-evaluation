Limitless Future of GAI\n\nDespite the moral arguments about the potential of GAI, it has a bright future. The increasing number of reused IT infrastructure facilities is helping fuel the market’s growth. This will allow more developers to create exciting new platforms and programs and encourage faster technology adoption. The rapid emergence and evolution of machine learning has created a unique competitive advantage for many companies. This technology can help them improve customer support and workflows and develop new research materials. In the future, there will be a shift in how content is generated and presented, with AI-generated text, program code, and stock images becoming more prevalent. Although GAI is still in its infancy, its use is already creating various ethical problems. This will make it harder to distinguish between misleading and unethical content. This technology will eventually have to be appropriately managed to avoid affecting the public. Despite its challenges, it is still expected to continue developing and revolutionizing how people use the internet.\n\nAI developers commonly use GAI to create texts, images, and videos. However, it is also helpful in various practical applications. For instance, one of the most popular projects in this field is Grammarly, which helps people improve their English writing. Due to AI’s potential to improve people’s quality of life, investors are starting to support the development of GAI in the biotech industry. According to Gartner, by 2025, 50% of all drug discovery will be carried out using AI. The medical technology and pharmaceutical sectors are expected to benefit from this technology. According to experts, GAI could also revolutionize the marketing industry by 2025 [32, 39]. AI is expected to generate around 30% of all outbound marketing messages, benefiting the marketing industry. Beyond this, GAI plays a crucial role in advancing human communication by enabling computers to understand and converse in natural language instead of programming languages. This technology is helping to make our interactions with machines more natural. Models powered by GAI can simultaneously process various types of images and texts, making them more versatile [34, 37]. The generalization of the human–machine interaction process and the availability of experts to train models are two of the factors that contribute to the quality of generative models. This technology is expected to play a significant role in the evolution of AI, making generative models more complex and capable of performing various tasks instead of being fun.\n\nA study was conducted on 20 recently published technical blogs on Twitter from December 2022 to January 2023, along with a few related information science academic publications on these topics, to come up with a word cloud which provided a base for the study.

Practical Implications\n\nRobots will eventually devalue the administrative and clerical skills of people. They can perform tasks such as generating advertising copy and human resources letters.

Practical Implications\n\nRobots will eventually devalue the administrative and clerical skills of people. They can perform tasks such as generating advertising copy and human resources letters. Automobile experts have predicted that up to 70% of the work people do in front of a computer could be automated in the next few years. According to technical experts, many now trust chatbots as writing assistants. Although it is not a job killer, outsourcing this work could help motivate human employees to focus on more productive tasks [36,38]. The ChatGPT language model can process various types of natural language. It can potentially replace humans in specific tasks, such as those that are simple to complete. ChatGPT can help programmers identify common errors in their code. It can also be used to create an email to facilitate a meeting. ChatGPT could have “massive implications” for various tasks.\n\n# 9. Industrial Implications\n\nThe rise of ChatGPT is redefining what a machine can learn. The new models created and launched are designed to help organizations improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Many executives believe that the process is like that of the Industrial Revolution. Over the years, executives have warned that AI could replace people’s repetitive and mundane tasks [34, 38]. According to one executive, machines could replace manual tasks, such as performing maintenance on microscopes and images. However, another executive expressed skepticism about the vision of robots freeing people up to do more productive work, calling it too far-fetched.\n\nAccording to a retail expert, the rise of machine learning and robotic process automation is helping organizations improve their efficiency and effectiveness. He noted that GAI allows them to get the answers they need much faster. However, many AI skeptics are still concerned about the potential impact of technology on people. They noted that it could lead to the development of false information and the loss of jobs [12, 38]. Some of the issues they are worried about include the noise in the data, which could lead\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
