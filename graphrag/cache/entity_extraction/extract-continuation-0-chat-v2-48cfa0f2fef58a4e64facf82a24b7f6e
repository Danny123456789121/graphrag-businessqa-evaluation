For testing the potential moderation effects of methodological artifacts, we run partial HOMA. We divided the complete sample into subsets referring to methodological artifacts. Thus, we contrasted the effect sizes of studies that failed to control for certain determinants (i.e., firm size, type of industry, financial risk, R&D intensity, advertising intensity, and capital intensity) with studies that included pertinent control variables. Therefore, if we report a statistically significant QB (indicating significant between-group heterogeneity and thus the presence of a moderation effect), this suggests that studies that did not include this variable systematically reported stronger or weaker relationships than studies that did control for this variable. This procedure parallels the approach used by van Essen et al. (in press) and Allouche and Laroche (2005). We also distinguished between studies controlling for possible endogeneity and studies accounting for this issue. Furthermore, we contrasted studies drawing on cross-sectional samples with studies that focused on a single industry. Finally, we distinguished between studies published after the year 1997 and studies published earlier.\n\nFor robustness purposes, we also calculated the reliability-corrected correlations by using a 0.7 and 0.9 reliability estimate. We did not find changes in the main results of our analyses.\n\n# Coding of the studies\n\nTo gather the data needed for our analysis, we developed a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). In general, the unit of analysis in our meta-analyses was the individual study (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). However, as noted earlier, we used two different types of effect size statistics: product-moment correlations for the bivariate HOMA and partial correlations for the partial HOMA. From 117 out of 149 studies we were able to derive both types of effect size measures, from 32 studies only bivariate correlations were available. While the coding of product–moment correlations was relatively straightforward, the coding of the partial correlations merits some explanation. A substantial number of the studies reported the results of several regression models, due to different measures of the constructs or different model specifications. In cases in which studies reported multiple results due to different regression model specifications that did not imply different sub-dimensions of CEP (i.e., process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP) or CFP (i.e., accounting-based CFP and market-based CFP), different temporal sequences of measurement, or differences with regard to the methodological artifacts we sought to examine, we calculated the effect sizes from the model with the largest R2 (Aloe & Becker, 2009). In cases in which the studies reported multiple results referring to different sub-dimensions of CEP or CFP, in cases of different temporal sequences of measurement, and in cases in which multiple results involve the methodological artifacts of interest, we included several effect sizes from the same study in our analysis. This proceeding, to some extent, introduced the problem of non-independence of data (e.g., Gleser & Olkin, 1994). However, we argue that it was the best possible approach, given the purpose of examining potential moderation effects (Bausch & Pils, 2009). Moreover, as Dalton and Dalton (2005) noted, dependency does not appear to be a serious problem in the field of management research, when compared to other fields. For each model from which we derived a partial correlation, we coded categorical variables referring to the methodological artifacts we suggested for potential moderation effects. Table 1 provides a description of the coding of the variables.\n\nInitially a set of studies was coded collectively by the authors to establish and validate the coding rules and the decision heuristics (Sleesman, Conlon, McNamara, & Miles, 2012). Afterwards, one author coded all studies. In cases of ambiguity the authors met and resolved the issues through discussion before reaching consensus (Bausch & Pils, 2009; Kirca et al., 2012; Sleesman et al., 2012).\n\n# Results\n\n# Bivariate HOMA\n\nTable 2 summarizes the results of the bivariate HOMA. The summary effect of the overall relationship between CEP and CFP is .102 (k = 245, N = 201,511, p < .001). The 95% confidence interval, ranging from .085 to .119, does not include zero. To test for potential publication bias, we calculated the fail-safe k (p = .05), which indicated the absence of publication bias, as 10,959 null-effect studies would be necessary to make the summary effect insignificant. To examine the causal direction of the relationship, we divided the data set according to the temporal sequence of measurement. Hypothesis 1b was supported as we found a positive effect of process-based CEP on subsequent accounting-based CFP.\n\n1997 is the latest year covered by the meta-analysis of Orlitzky et al.
