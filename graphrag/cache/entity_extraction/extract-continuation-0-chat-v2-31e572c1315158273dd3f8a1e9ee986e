For example, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) find a significant positive association between auditor’s credibility and CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Lu and Abeysekera (2014) provide evidence of an insignificant positive relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. Furthermore, Ling and Sultana (2015), and Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) find insignificant negative impact of auditors’ credibility on CSD. Prior researchers measure this variable by considering a dummy variable equal to one if a company is audited by one of the Big-four audit firms and zero otherwise.\n\n# 2.8 Diversity of Ownership\n\n# 2.8.1 Government Ownership\n\nPrior literature measures government ownership in different ways. It means the percentage of shares owned by the government (Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Naser et al., 2006, Suwaidan et al., 2004, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010). Some of the researchers measure it by taking a dummy variable equal to one if the company is a government company and zero otherwise (Lim et al., 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014). As a government-owned company, it has to aware of the interests of the public and so should disclose more social related activities because government operations are always monitored by the public (Mohd Ghazali, 2007). As government body is politically sensitive and trusted by the people, it has to create more pressure on the companies for disclosing information related to stakeholders (Muttakin and Subramaniam, 2015). Hence, it is predicted that government ownership affects significantly and positively on CSD. But, the previous empirical literature provides mixed results. For example, Suwaidan et al. (2004), Mohd Ghazali (2007), and Lim et al. (2008), Mohd Ghazali (2007) find a significant positive association between government ownership and CSD. Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) find a significant negative relationship between government ownership and CSD. In contrast, some academicians find that there is a positive and insignificant relationship exists between government ownership and CSD (Ahmed Haji, 2013, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014, Naser et al., 2006, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010).\n\n# 2.8.2 Foreign Ownership\n\nThe greater percentage of foreign ownership of a company indicates more intention to practice foreign rules and regulations (Jeon et al., 2011). Bradbury (1991), and Haniffa and Cooke (2005) argue that stronger foreign ownership creates geographic distance among the owners and so higher level of disclosure expected from the shareholders of the foreign countries. Prior literature measures this variable in two different ways. Some researchers consider the percentage of shares owned by the foreign shareholders for measuring foreign\n\n# 2.8.3 Institutional Ownership\n\nIt indicates the percentage of shares owned by the institutional investors. Institutional owners play a fundamental role in changing corporate management behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Institutional investors treated as majority shareholders and they influence to the management for disclosing more information (Naser et al., 2006). Prior literature shows mixed results. For example, Majeed et al. (2015) find a significant positive relation between institutional ownership and CSD. On the other hand, Li and Zhang (2010) and Nurhayati et al. (2016) find an insignificant positive association between institutional owners and CSD. In addition, Naser et al. (2006), and Rashid and Lodh (2008) provide evidence of an insignificant negative relationship between institutional ownership and CSD.\n\n# 2.8.4 Managerial Ownership\n\nManagerial ownership indicates the percentage of shares owned by the directors. In an owner-managed company, the interests of the outsiders are relatively small, and the disclosures of CSR information may be less (Mohd Ghazali, 2007). Eng and Mak (2003) find that the lower percentage of managerial ownership increases disclosures information. Hence, it is expected that there is a negative relationship between managerial ownership and CSD. Prior literature supports the negative association between managerial ownership and CSD. But, some studies find a significant impact of managerial ownership on CSD (Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007), whereas Ahmed Haji (2013), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Supriyono et al. (2015) find an insignificant relationship between managerial ownership and CSD.\n\n# 2.8.5 Concentrated Ownership\n\nConcentrated ownership indicates the possession which occupied by few shareholders or family members (Mohd Ghazali and Weetman, 2006). It is a necessary component of effective corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). According to agency theory, the widely dispersed ownership company faces more agency-principal conflicts (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Accordingly, public accountability becomes vital for the widely held companies because these enterprises have a greater chance of being detained by the public as a whole (Mohd Ghazali, 2007) and such companies have to provide substantial social information (Ahmed Haji, 2013). Hence, it is our expectation that concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures (CSD) express the significant negative relationship.
