To our knowledge, our paper is the first that investigates the influence of moderators on both ESs and AESs.\n\nAnother reason for the lack of sound summary papers is the diversity and complexity of existing studies with regard to samples, methodologies, performance measures, investment universe, benchmarks, etc. A meta-analysis is a very useful scientific tool to synthesize a wide variety of heterogeneous papers. It calculates ES that can be interpreted as a standardized difference between performances of SRI and conventional portfolios. By standardizing performance differences, whatever the performance measures, a common measure of difference between the two types of portfolios is generated, making synthesis possible across very diverse papers.\n\nGiven the situation in SRI research, this article attempts to achieve the following goals. First, we provide a sound synthesis of existing literature which shows an overall influence of SRI on investment performance in terms of sign and magnitude through a meta-analysis. Then, we examine a variety of determinants of SRI influence, since it is conceivable that the magnitude and direction of SRI effects may have a systematic relationship with sample characteristics and research methodologies. The analyses on moderators will help us to produce interesting implications for future research and practice. When performing the analysis, we carefully explain our meta-analysis and data collection process to ensure replicability.\n\nThis study is organized as follows. In the next section, we develop hypotheses regarding the overall impact of SRI and moderators that can have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. In Section 3, we explain the meta-analysis and the concept of ES and show definitions of moderators used for hypothesis testing. In Section 4, we present our sampling process in detail, since sampling is crucial in performing and interpreting a meta-analysis. Section 5 reports the meta-analysis results, and Section 6 presents conclusions and discussions.\n\n# 2. Hypotheses\n\nOur initial research interest is on the average impact of SRI on investment performance. Thus, we first propose a hypothesis on the overall ES and then proceed to establish hypotheses for moderators that may have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. We attempt to employ moderators to reflect research characteristics as extensively as possible based on theory and practice. We split the moderators into two broad categories: sampling and methodology. Sampling relates to data collection, and methodology is about analysis tools.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# 2.1. Overall Effect Size\n\nThe CSR literature shows that CSR firms perform better than non-CSR firms (Wu, 2006; Margolis et al., 2009). Since SRI invests more in CSR firms, the performance of SRI will be higher than conventional investments. SRI performance can also be better since SRI fund managers may have a deeper knowledge of their investment pools (Girard et al., 2007; Gil-Bazo et al., 2010). SRI screening eliminates unethical firms from the investment universe, and fund managers can focus on a relatively small number of firms. In fact, Kacperczyk et al. (2005) show that more concentrated portfolios produce a higher return than broadly diversified portfolios. SRI fund turnover is lower since SRI investors are more loyal to social values than conventional investors, and the resulting lower transaction costs also predict a better performance.\n\nOn the other hand, portfolio theory predicts an inferior performance of SRI portfolios. Other things being equal, SRI constraints on the investment universe will lead to a less favorable efficient frontier, sacrificing diversification benefits (Girard et al., 2007; Renneboog et al., 2008a). For example, excluding sin stocks can cause investors to sacrifice returns, since they generate a higher risk-adjusted return than conventional stocks (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Durand et al., 2013; Borgers et al., 2015). The higher transaction costs and management fees of SRI funds also predict an inferior performance, since they are relatively small, losing economies of scale (Bauer et al., 2005; Barnett and Salomon, 2006). Ayadi et al. (2011) find that the average expense ratio of Canadian SRI fund is 1.97%, which is much larger than the 1.29% global benchmark for conventional funds.\n\nFinally, any impact of SRI cannot be justified theoretically. The efficient market hypothesis predicts that SRI portfolios and funds cannot produce abnormal returns, since investors and fund managers can easily replicate ethical screening procedures which are public information. Even though some SRI funds seem to outperform conventional funds, their performance superiority may vanish if transaction costs are subtracted.\n\nOn the empirical side, evidence is also mixed with positive (Hickman and Teets, 1999; Guenster et al., 2005; Brander, 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2007; Galema et al., 2008; Peiris and Evans, 2010) and negative (Mueller, 1991; Girard et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2013) impacts for SRI. In addition, there are many papers reporting no impact. For example, Kreander et al. (2005) uncover similar performances between SRI and conventional funds when they investigate the SRI funds of seven European countries. Bauer et al. (2007) examine a sample of Canadian ethical funds and again find no significant difference between SRI and conventional funds. In addition, there are still many papers that report no difference between SRI and conventional investments (Sauer, 1997; Hutton et al., 1998; Benson et al., 2006; Kempf and Osth\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
