To capture this, we created a dummy variable equal to one when the news is related to the ‘‘main concern’’ of the firm targeted. The main concern is defined at the industry level, based on the relative percentage of E, S and G news. Firms are classified into six industries: Banks, Basic Resources, Chemicals (including health care), Consumer goods and services, Industrial goods, and Technology. Unsurprisingly, environment is the main concern for ‘‘Basic Resources’’ and ‘‘Chemicals,’’ social issues are the most important for ‘‘Consumer goods and services’’ and ‘‘Industrial goods,’’ and corporate governance is the main stake for ‘‘Banks’’ and ‘‘Technology.’’\n\n# Trends\n\nOur regressions include a linear monthly trend from January 2002 to December 2010 (hypothesis #6).\n\nThese lists have been manually checked. The complete list (with more than 1000 sources) is available on request.\n\nFor example, the percentage of bad ESG news published by the media on environmental issues is equal to 7% for the banking industry and to 35% for the chemical industry. Conversely, the percentage of bad ESG news published by the media on corporate governance issues is equal to 24% for the banking industry and to 11% for the chemical industry (see Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017).\n\n# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\nuse Google Insights for Search between 2004 and 2010 to capture public attention (Da et al. 2011). Google Insights for Search provides insights into the search terms people have been entering into the Google search engine. In this study, we use the keyword ‘‘economic crisis’’ (hypothesis #7) and extract a weekly index. The value of the index is lower than 10 until September–October 2008, when it jumps to 100 in few weeks with the failure of Lehman Brothers. Since then, the index declines regularly toward 20 at the end of 2012.\n\n# Reputation\n\nWe proxy CSR reputation, for each firm or sector, by the number of positive ESG news over the total number of ESG news (positive and negative) published by the media (hypotheses #8a & #8b). We calculate this ratio on the year preceding each event to have a rolling measure compatible with companies’ fixed effects. As we want to test simultaneously sectoral and idiosyncratic reputation’s impact on abnormal returns, the firm reputation is defined in comparison to its peers. The latter is a measure of the relative good reputation of a firm compared to the average reputation of a sector. That is, sector reputation is defined between 0 and 1, while firm reputation is defined between -1 and 1.\n\n# Distance\n\nWe implement a first indicator of the distance between the country where the event takes place and the firm’s country of origin by considering the logarithm of the distance between the two countries. We implement also a dummy variable equal to 1 if the country where the event takes place and the firm’s country of origin have a common official language (hypothesis #11). Data on geographical and cultural distance are from the CEPII.\n\n# Size\n\nWe control for the size of the firms using total assets (in logarithm). A priori, two opposite effects could play a role concerning the influence of the size on the impact of ESG news. On the one hand, investors may be more sensitive to ESG news concerning large firms (Aouadi and Marsat 2016), but on the other hand, the shares of small firms are less liquid, and their reallocation possibilities are weaker. We use also the Price Earning Ratio as a control variable.\n\n# Greenwashing\n\nTo assess greenwashing (hypothesis #9), we compute the percentage of positive ESG news disclosed by a firm (or a sector) over the total number of positive ESG news related to this firm (or sector). As for the reputation, we designed a time frame of 1 year preceding each event to have a rolling measure. The greenwashing variable is between 0 and 1 at the sectoral level and between -1 and 1 at the firm level.\n\n# The Impact of ESG News on Stock Prices\n\n# Event Analysis of CAR\n\nWe investigate whether the tone of the articles matters (hypotheses #10a & #10b). To quantify this, we rely on four tag categories of the Inquirer dictionary (including the).\n\n12 An alternative would be to use the Volatility Index (VIX) computed by the CBOE and based on the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index options. Often referred to as the fear index, it shows a very similar pattern.\n\n13 We also used the Fortune Magazine’s annual ranking of the ‘‘world’s most admired companies.’’ A problem, however, is that it does not cover all the firms included in our sample. Moreover, according to McGuire et al. (1988), Fortune Magazine’s ranking is linked to prior financial performance.\n\n14 We also used a 6-month and a 2-year time frame for robustness tests, but it does not change the results.\n\nTo test the hypotheses #1 and #2, we assess the statistical significance of average abnormal returns by setting apart negative and positive ESG news. Then, to test hypothesis #3 we repeat the analysis separately for ESG news published by firms, media and NGOs.
