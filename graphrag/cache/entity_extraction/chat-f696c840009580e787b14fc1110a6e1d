Thus, meta-analyses on that topic are major complements to prior literature reviews. In contrast to other related meta-analyses, we focus on selected board composition variables on the one side and CSR reporting on the other side. As CSR reporting is one of the most common variables of analyzing CSR engagement, we decide to focus on this variable and not on other measures (e.g. donations, external CSR ratings without any link to CSR reporting). CSR reporting mainly relates to corporate governance aspects, e.g. the information on sustainable management compensation or (gender) diversity on the board of directors. As researchers, regulators and companies are more and more aware of possible relationships, there is little knowledge about the overall impact of those board composition variables on CSR reporting from an international perspective. Insofar, our meta-analysis contributes to the present literature as we analyze the overall impact of the most common board composition variables by 51 papers on board composition variables and CSR reporting.\n\nOur analysis is aimed at researchers, regulators, and practitioners alike. It provides starting points for future research activities in terms of investigating the link between board composition and CSR reporting variables. The findings also provide an important impetus for the analysis and development of recent sustainable corporate governance regulations. As already stated, board composition is currently regulated as an instrument in order to strengthen CSR reporting. Our meta-analysis will contribute to this regulatory discussion by showing the possible outcomes of these reforms. Finally, we would like to motivate corporate practice to recognize the interactions of board composition and CSR reporting activities as key elements of building stakeholder trust.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows. First, the research framework is presented from a theoretical and empirical perspective. In so doing, we first present the theoretical framework, followed by a review of the empirical literature on our board composition variables and CSR reporting and by an analysis of the moderating variables of our study (Section 2). In this context, we deduct the hypotheses of our meta-analysis. Then, the research method will be presented: criteria for inclusion, search strategy, primary study variables, moderators, and analysis strategy (Section 3). Furthermore, we present the results of our meta-analysis and the sensitivity analysis (Section 4). Finally, in our discussion, we stress the main recommendations for research, practice, and regulators (Section 5). The paper will close with our conclusions.\n\n# 2. THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION OF THE IMPACT OF BOARD COMPOSITION ON CSR REPORTING\n\n# 2.1. Theoretical framework\n\nBoard composition can have a positive or negative impact on CSR reporting. This assumption relies on theories based on economics (e.g. stakeholder-agency theory) that assume a positive relationship by tendency or on socio-political theories (e.g. legitimacy theory) that assume a negative connection. According to stakeholder-agency theory, CSR reporting should decrease information asymmetries and conflicts of interest between management and different stakeholder groups. Monitoring institutions such as the board of directors are an application of agency theory that enhances the decision usefulness of CSR reports. However, board directors can only fulfil the information needs of stakeholders if some requirements, e.g. board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and appropriate board size are realized. When stakeholders are satisfied with board composition and CSR reporting, a positive impact can be expected on corporate financial and CSR performance.\n\nIn contrast to stakeholder-agency theory, legitimacy theory stresses a negative relationship between board composition and CSR reporting. Organizations seek to comply with their society’s specific norms, values and boundaries by implementing innovative reporting tools, such as CSR reporting. This can enhance organizations’ image as good corporate citizens, as well as their competitive position. Legitimacy theory recognizes the risks that positive self-\n\n# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\n\n# 2.2. Board composition variables and CSR reporting\n\n# 2.2.1. Board independence\n\nStakeholder-agency theory stresses the importance of non-executive directors being independent of the executive directors. Board independence is a necessary condition for monitoring measures with the aim of CSR reporting that fulfils the stakeholders’ informational needs. Research has stated a positive influence of independent board members on reporting quality (Farber, 2005) as well as the quality of external audits (DeFond et al., 2005) and a reduced cost of capital (Anderson et al., 2003). Without adequate board independence, stakeholder-agency theory assumes higher management incentives to use “boilerplates” in the CSR reporting without precise information for the stakeholders or even use greenwashing strategy to manipulate the public. According to legitimacy theory, board independence can also be linked with those negative incentives of CSR reporting. This may be explained by a symbolic management strategy to appoint more independent board directors without reflection of stakeholders’ interests of CSR reporting.\n\nInsofar, it is not surprising, that the empirical results of board independence are mixed. Among others, Das et al. (2015), Khan (2010) and Htay et al. (2012) stated a positive relationship between board independence and CSR reporting. In contrast to this, Sundarasen et al. (2016), Haniffa and Cooke (2005) and Prado-Lorenzo et al. (2012) found a negative relationship. The heterogeneous theoretical and empirical research results lead to the following hypotheses:\n\n- H1a: Board independence is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory.\n- H1b: Board independence is negatively linked to CSR reporting in line with legitimacy theory.\n\n# 2.2.2. CEO duality\n\nIn the one-tier system, the theoretical necessity for an internal division between executive and non-executive duties on the board of directors arises from the notion that management is mainly guided by the intent to maximize its own profit\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
