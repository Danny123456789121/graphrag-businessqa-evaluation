Enhanced by its text generation capacity, AI can provide in-depth descriptions of each supplier's advantages and drawbacks. Additionally, it can facilitate the creation of various negotiation tactics and contractual terms predicated on historical data and predicted supplier behavior.\n\n# Supply chain risk mitigation\n\nGenerative AI's utility extends to the domain of risk management (e.g., political, economic, cultural, and partner), where it assists in scenario-based risk assessment by generating potential disruption models, including instances like supplier insolvency, strikes, natural calamities, pandemics, and more. Through a detailed and ongoing analysis of potential disruptions and danger points, companies can devise resilient strategies to ensure business continuity. For example, in a supply chain disruption, AI can generate viable alternatives based on several factors tied to our traditional logistics service quality metrics (Mentzer et al., 2021), thereby maintaining customer service trade-off targets. These sophisticated models can also develop contingency plans for various disruptions, incorporating all input from managerial prompts.\n\n# Procurement and inventory accuracy\n\nGenerative AI's predictive powers facilitate more accurate demand and sales forecasts, enabling companies to schedule their orders and quantities from suppliers optimally. This allows for lean management practices, mitigating waste and amplifying resource and process efficiency. In addition to demand prediction—a traditional application of the AI model, generative AI can craft flexible inventory policies, optimizing the costs of overstocking or understocking. For instance, it can formulate strategies for just-in-time inventory management, potentially decreasing storage costs and enhancing cash flow.\n\n# Distribution, transportation, and logistics coordination\n\nGenerative AI can formulate effective distribution strategies and logistic pathways, considering constraints and objectives, such as cost reduction, service level maximization, routing disruptions, weather conditions, and environmental considerations. Additionally, AI can develop backup plans in the event of disruptions such as traffic jams or severe weather. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of diverse, real-time data—including traffic, weather, vehicle specifications, and fuel costs—the AI can devise the most efficient transportation routes. For instance, the AI system can design a route for a delivery truck making several stops within a city that minimizes travel time or fuel usage. Furthermore, the AI can provide textual justifications for the selected routes, offering logistics managers a broader range of options and facilitating superior decision making. Given explicit constraints and stipulations as inputs, generative AI can architect ideal layouts for storage and picking activities within warehouses. Factors such as item-specific demand frequency, merchandise's physical dimensions, and various storage and handling apparatus capacities are integral to this algorithmic design.\n\n# Customer relations\n\nGenerative AI can be leveraged as chatbots within the consumer sector to automate interaction with clientele. This involves providing bespoke updates on order statuses, estimated delivery times and addressing inquiries or grievances. The upshot is enhancing customer satisfaction, overall experience, service quality, and client retention. In this context, these intricate models can aid in creating tailored marketing and sales strategies for distinct customer demographics, products, or regions based on predictive analysis of consumer data and market trends.\n\n# Sustainable and ethically conscious practices\n\nBy optimizing logistical routes, minimizing warehousing necessities, and bolstering resource utilization, AI can aid companies in diminishing their carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. AI can architect models to discern and evaluate the societal and environmental implications of sourcing from varied suppliers, thus aiding businesses in prioritizing fair trade and ethical sourcing practices. Moreover, these models could be deployed to strategize distribution efforts (particularly in sectors like health and food supply) to ensure adequate accessibility for underserved communities under regular conditions and during crises or disasters. For example, a corporation might employ generative AI to ensure diligent supply chain operations. The AI could scrutinize data from supplier audits, regulatory filings, and media reports to pinpoint potential compliance risks. Upon detecting a risk, such as a supplier contravening labor laws, the AI could suggest a spectrum of responses, including detailed audits, scouting alternative suppliers, or collaborating with suppliers to address the issue (Pan & Nishant, 2023).\n\n# CHALLENGES: CONTAINING MR. HYDE\n\nIn the current L&SCM landscape, the integration of AI promises unprecedented potential for innovation and efficiency. However, it is not devoid of substantial challenges. The adoption and integration of AI within existing frameworks propel a complex array of hurdles spanning ethical considerations, data privacy, transparency, and visibility (Morgan et al., 2023), copyright issues, the lack of regulatory templates, and workforce adaptability (Budhwar et al., 2023; Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). Moreover, the sector establishes robust strategies to safeguard against potential misuse and security breaches inherent with AI technologies and their variants, all while nurturing a synergy between human expertise and automated intelligence. As the L&SCM sector traverses this transformative journey, exploring these challenges is vital to creating a pathway that can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating the associated risks, fostering a SCM&L sector that is not only technologically advanced but also productive, resilient, and sustainable. In this context, we outline vital challenges below.\n\n# EDITORIAL\n\n# Training AI\n\nTraining AI applications and their variants, like Chat-GPT, presents significant challenges when integrating them into any domain, including L&SCM. These applications require vast amounts of data to function optimally, and acquiring or generating these data can be resource-intensive. While data are one of the critical ingredients to operationalize AI within any business application, organizations, especially supply chain small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) partners, usually lack robust data management processes, policies, and technical infrastructure, which can significantly impede their ability to leverage AI applications within various business operations successfully. For AI systems like ChatGPT, high-quality, diverse, and representative data are imperative to ensure that the systems can generate meaningful and insightful outputs, depending on the context of use.
