The sample period is also relevant given that it allows assessing the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and eventual recovery in the aftermath. The whole sample of firms is distributed among several sectors of the economy (Table I). As can be observed in Table I, membership to the ISE seems to attract firms from all industries. It is worth mentioning that three sectors – “Chemicals, paper products, metal-mechanical”, “Financial” and “Electrical, Water supply and sanitary services” – exhibit higher proportions of firms in the ISE than out of it. This can be motivated by characteristics of firms’ interests on positive visibility and also because of industry regulation. For example, in Brazil, the National Agency of Electrical Energy establishes specific sustainability guidelines for the energy sector (Braga et al., 2014).\n\n# 3.2 Models and method\n\nThe difficulties in finding adequate measures for firms social and sustainability concerns are probably because of the diversity of actions a firm may undertake in such framework, the\n\n# Table I Sample distribution by industry\n\n|Industry|Full sample n (%)|Leading CSP firms (ISE firms) n (%)|Other firms (non-ISE firms) n (%)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Petroleum and fuel products|50 (1.86)|2 (0.62)|48 (2.03)|\n|Chemicals, paper products and metal-mechanical|390 (14.53)|55 (16.98)|335 (14.19)|\n|Equipment, electrical machinery and transport equipment|231 (8.60)|19 (5.86)|212 (8.98)|\n|Building and transportation|288 (10.73)|23 (7.10)|265 (11.22)|\n|Food products, beverages and tobacco|255 (9.50)|14 (4.32)|241 (10.21)|\n|Textile, clothing, leather and footwear|344 (12.81)|13 (4.01)|331 (14.02)|\n|Communication|74 (2.76)|16 (4.94)|58 (2.46)|\n|Electrical, water supply and sanitary services|379 (14.12)|114 (35.19)|265 (11.22)|\n|Financial|268 (9.98)|45 (13.89)|223 (9.45)|\n|Others|406 (15.12)|23 (7.10)|383 (16.22)|\n|Total|2,685 (100.00)|324 (100.00)|2,361 (100.00)|\n\nabsence of uniform disclosure format and also its non-mandatory nature (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Aguinis and Glavas, 2012). Sustainability concerns are associated with firm’s environmental concerns and also with firm’s capacity to maintain performance and competitive advantage which may be dependent on good management and corporate governance practices, which signals the relevance given to the economic pillar of sustainability (Moldan et al., 2012). All this means that CSP indices are subject to complex measuring strategies as can be seen in the multiplicity of indices used (Li and Tang, 2007; Hodgson et al., 2011).\n\nThis work uses the membership to the Brazilian Firm ISE as proxy for the level of firm CSP given that it integrates CSR and sustainability concerns. The annual membership to the ISE is the dependent variable (CSP) in the logit panel data model of equation (1):\n\nCSPi;t = b0 + b1 OWNCi;t + b2 RSKINDi;t + b3 ROAi;t + b4 SIZE + b5 GOPPi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (1)\n\nIn model of equation (1), the dummy variable CSP, is set to 1 if firm i is present in the ISE at year t, meaning high CSP, and 0 otherwise. OWNC is a measure of ownership concentration in hands of the first up to the fifth main stockholder. It corresponds to the voting capital held by the main stockholder (OWNC1), the sum of voting capital in hands of the two main stockholders (OWNC2) and so forth up to the sum of voting stocks held by the five main stockholders (OWNC5). Additionally, for sensitivity analysis, we also estimate alternate logit panel data models. First, we use the annual Herfindahl index of voting ownership concentration in hands of the five main voting shareholders for each firm-year observation (HI5). The Herfindahl index corresponds to the sum of squares of voting stocks held by each of the five main shareholders following previous literature (Maury and Pajuste, 2005). Second, we use a dummy variable for the presence of a dominant controlling shareholder, i.e. a stockholder that holds more than 50 per cent of voting capital (MAJOR).\n\nEnvironmental risky industry (RSKIND) was taken into account based on the Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment (Law 10.165/2000). Such law created a fee for environmental control and inspection that are to be paid by firms from environmental risky industries. Law 10.165/2000 lists which are those environmental risky industries in terms of the potential to damage the natural environment. Thus, RSKIND is a dummy variable that is set to 1 if the firm sector is in the list of environmental risky industries, and is set to 0 otherwise.\n\nGrowth opportunities (GOPP) is proxied by Tobin’s q which is calculated as the ratio between firm’s market value plus debt, and firm’s accounting value, as usual in the literature (Villalonga and Amit, 2006).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSP is a firm that is part of the Brazilian Firm ISE, which integrates CSR and sustainability concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ISE (Corporate Sustainability Index) is a stock index in Brazil that evaluates companies based on their sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BM&FBOVESPA is the main stock exchange in Brazil where CSP is listed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|>GEO<|>Brazil is the country where the ISE operates and where the firms are assessed for sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL AGENCY OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>This agency establishes specific sustainability guidelines for the energy sector in Brazil.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL RISKY INDUSTRIES<|>EVENT<|>Environmental risky industries are sectors identified by Brazilian law that have the potential to damage the natural environment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>ISE<|>CSP is a member of the ISE, which evaluates its corporate sustainability practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>CSP is listed on the BM&FBOVESPA stock exchange<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISE<|>BM&FBOVESPA<|>The ISE operates within the BM&FBOVESPA stock exchange<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL AGENCY OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY<|>CSP<|>The National Agency of Electrical Energy establishes sustainability guidelines that CSP must follow<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL RISKY INDUSTRIES<|>NATIONAL AGENCY OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY<|>The National Agency of Electrical Energy regulates environmental risky industries in Brazil<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>BRAZIL<|>CSP operates within Brazil and is subject to its laws and regulations<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
