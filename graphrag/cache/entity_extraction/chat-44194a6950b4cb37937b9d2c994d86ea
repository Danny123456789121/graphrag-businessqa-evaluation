First, publishers and journals are now reaching a consensus on how AI's writing assistance should be acknowledged in submitted manuscripts (Eddleston et al., 2023; Elsevier, 2023). However, can generative AI help researchers address possible ethical dilemmas and trade-offs? What choices would ChatGPT make when asked about solving ethical dilemmas? Would it embrace a value-based (i.e., deontological) or cost-benefit (i.e., utilitarian) philosophical approach to ethics? Can it anticipate possible research misconduct and help researchers prevent a future retraction? There is a need to address these and many other related questions.\n\n# 5.2.4 Conclusions\n\nWe conducted a case study to critically evaluate the potential of generative AI as a methodology assistant. ChatGPT has useful capabilities: it can help researchers generate ideas; suggest theories; select research designs, measures, and data-analytic approaches; and provide general guidance on how to conduct ethical research and report results. However, ChatGPT also has limitations related to constrained training data, which result in generating too many, too few, or too vague recommendations, including repeating methodological errors of the past and offering recommendations on research ethics that are too broad and not sufficiently actionable or specific. Thus, we conclude that generative AI can be used as a complementary tool but not as a replacement for researcher judgement. Using a phrase made famous by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, when using generative AI as a methodology assistant, our recommendation is to trust, but verify.\n\n# 6 AI, ECONOMY, SOCIETY AND HRM: POSSIBILITY, UNCERTAINTY AND RISK\n\nPawan Budhwar1, Soumyadeb Chowdhury2, and Geoffrey Wood3,4,5,6\n\nThe rapid advances in AI technologies have opened new possibilities for HRM practices and research. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way organizations manage their workforce, from recruitment and selection to employee engagement and performance management. However, while the use of generative AI in HRM has the potential to increase efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness, it also raises important ethical, moral, legal, and social implications that must be carefully examined. As with any new technology, the full consequences will only become apparent some time down the line. A further indeterminacy is around its present state of development; it remains unclear as to how much it exhibits is genuine and autonomous intelligence and how much is simply a mechanistic implementation of complex sets of algorithms. In this research agenda setting section, we outline a series of research themes importing common themes from the perspectives presented so far. The aim is to deepen our understanding of the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI in HRM. Specifically, we aim to explore the potential of generative AI for improving HRM practices, while also addressing issues related to bias, discrimination, privacy, and transparency.\n\n# 6.1 Theme 1: Work, skills and education\n\nGenerative AI applications have the potential to change the meaningfulness and nature of work, which may lead to direct job displacement within the HRM sector and may challenge human creativity. This is particularly so given that AI presently aims to solve problems through recourse to the knowledge it has access to; this may lead to the space for independent “blue sky” strategic thinking to be diminished. AI may also lead to a significant slimming down of the process side of the HR job, supplementing the earlier impact of HR software; the latter led to much basic HR administration being partially automated and partially delegated to line management. The existing literature (Daugherty et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2017) suggests the new categories of jobs AI will create that will require employees to train AI systems (trainers), understand, interpret, communicate and assess the relevance of outputs (explainers), and manage regulations and policies governing AI systems (sustainers). This, of course, assumes that if genuinely intelligent, AI systems may wish to be trained. If their intelligence is overstated, this may require complex tinkering with algorithms that may require very specialist technical knowledge, but not necessary understanding, creating further issues.\n\nIn the City of London in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, a great deal of damage was caused by those capable of devising complex mathematical trading models, but who lacked a basic understanding of finance. It is quite probable the same risks could be generated by those engaged in building, training, or governing AI HRM systems; knowing about AI system design does not make for an understanding of HRM. Some tasks that were previously done by humans, such as data entry and analysis, may now be automated. This could free up time for employees to focus on more strategic and creative tasks, which could increase the meaningfulness of their work. However, it could also lead to a sense of disengagement or lack of purpose for employees who are now doing more routine tasks.\n\nIn practical terms, AI may relieve a great deal of the drudgery around, say payroll, and help drive more equitable reward systems; it may also add to the overall administrative burden by generating ever more petty decisions for approval. According to a recent report by Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs (Vallance, 2023), creating ‘AI anxiety’ among workers about prospect of their role being superseded by technology (Cox, 2023; PWC., 2022). It might be anticipated that individuals with robust digital competencies, along with skills such as creativity and teamwork, which are more challenging for machines to mimic, will benefit from an AI revolution. It may also lead to the creation of more ‘bullshit jobs, that is ‘…\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
