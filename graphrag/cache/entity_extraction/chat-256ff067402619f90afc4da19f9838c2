Second, to depict the characteristics of these management processes, the authors analyzed the strategies and decided whether a proactive or defensive response is taken, and further coded these strategies as multi-level (e.g., involving managers from different levels), multi-stage (e.g., a dynamic and cyclic management process), or multi-paradox (e.g., both performing and organizing paradoxes are concerned). Finally, the authors investigated the short-term impacts (e.g., creativity and organizational learning) and long-term outcomes (e.g., economic and social performance enhancement) of these management strategies and their related practices. As for the initial screening of the focal articles, three of the authors independently analyzed the data. After each round of analysis, the authors discussed the coding together to resolve inconsistencies and ensure the accuracy and validity of the findings.\n\nNovember 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579272\n\n# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\n# TABLE 2 | Distributions of articles in journals.\n\n|Journals|Number of articles|\n|---|---|\n|Journal of Business Ethics|59|\n|Academy of Management Journal|10|\n|Academy of Management Review|8|\n|Business Ethics: A European Review|7|\n|Organization Studies|7|\n|Organization and Environment|6|\n|Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management|5|\n|Business Ethics Quarterly|4|\n|Journal of Management Studies|4|\n|Business Strategy and the Environment|4|\n|Administrative Science Quarterly|3|\n|Journal of Organizational Behavior|3|\n|Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|3|\n|Management and Organization Review|3|\n|Organization Science|3|\n|Strategic Management Journal|3|\n|Asia Paciﬁc Journal of Management|2|\n|Journal of International Business Studies|2|\n|Business and Society|2|\n|California Management Review|1|\n|International Journal of Management Reviews|1|\n|Harvard Business Review|1|\n|Total|141|\n\n# FINDINGS\n\nIn this section, the authors answer the following questions. First, what factors make sustainability tensions salient? Second, what are the strategies (e.g., proactive or defensive characteristics) to manage sustainability paradoxes? Third, what are the outcomes (short-term and long-term)? A list of the representative articles and their coding information is found in Table 3.\n\nIn corporate sustainability research (see Table 3), hybrid organizations, such as social enterprises, attract much attention. Other hybrid forms, such as cross-sector collaboration, are also discussed in sustainability studies. Unlike social enterprises, which focus on the centrality of their social mission (Chell, 2007), for-proﬁt ﬁrms are under increasing attention because of their greater emphasis on economic values; nevertheless, this is still under-researched. On the methodology front, while single-case longitudinal research is still the most popular, quantitative examinations have been increasing in recent years.\n\n# The Manifestation of Corporate Sustainability Paradoxes\n\nTwo sets of triggering factors that could manifest organizational paradoxical tensions have emerged, consistent with Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, namely, environmental factors and actors’ paradoxical cognition. The former emphasizes plurality, change, and the scarcity of the external environment, which all contribute to providing the material conditions of a paradox. The latter focuses on the actors themselves and highlights the role of personal frames and cognition. The research into paradoxical corporate sustainability also underlines these factors (see Table 3).\n\n# Environmental Factors\n\nIn general, organizational paradox\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
