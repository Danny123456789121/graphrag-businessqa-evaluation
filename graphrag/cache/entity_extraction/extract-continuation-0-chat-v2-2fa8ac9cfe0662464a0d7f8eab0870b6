As it is embedded into tools used by every knowledge worker, its additional impact may be more diffuse but no less valuable than that associated with these use cases. Companies need to find ways to maximize the value created by the generative AI they deploy while also taking care to monitor and manage its impact on their workforces and society at large.\n\n# The generative AI future of work: Impacts on work activities, economic growth, and productivity\n\nTechnology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines have given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines enabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. More recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that would have taken years to do manually.\n\nThese examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of individual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual level, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, although as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could affect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as a result of this technology than for older technologies.\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation of work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated that workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by\n\nadapting technology that existed at that time, or what we call technical automation potential. We also modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies could be adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy.\n\nTechnology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological capabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a solution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even when such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, which consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a sense of the pace and scale at which workers’ activities could shift over time.\n\nLarge-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented. Consider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years ago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and where to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a more macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of all workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people leave their jobs every month in the United States. But this does not minimize the challenges faced by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or societal challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in demand and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living.\n\nAlso, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic perspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the world’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are aging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.\n\nThe analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work activities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and integrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for technical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment the capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers whose activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the future (see Box 3, “About the research”).\n\nLabor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Box 3\n\n# About the research\n\nThis analysis builds on the methodology we established in 2017. We began by examining the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net breakdown of about 850 occupations into roughly 2,100 detailed work activities. For each of these activities, we scored the level of capability necessary to successfully perform the activity against a set of 18 capabilities that have the potential for automation (exhibit).\n\nWe also surveyed experts in the automation of each of these capabilities to estimate automation technologies’ current performance level against each of these capabilities, as well as how the technology’s performance might advance over time. Specifically, this year, we updated our assessments of technology’s performance in cognitive, language, and social and emotional capabilities based on a survey of generative AI experts.\n\nBased on these assessments of the technical automation potential of each detailed work activity at each point in time, we modeled potential scenarios for the adoption of work automation around the world. First, we estimated a range of time to implement a solution that could automate each specific detailed work activity, once all the capability requirements were met by the state of technology development. Second, we estimated a range of potential costs for this technology when it is first introduced, and then declining over time, based on historical precedents.\n\nThe modeled scenarios create a time range for the potential pace of automating current work activities. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Congressional Budget Office is a federal agency that provides economic data and analysis to support the U.S. Congress in its budgetary decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that analyzes economic trends and provides insights on the impact of technology on work and productivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can create content, automate tasks, and enhance productivity across various industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is a government agency that collects and analyzes labor economic data, including employment statistics and occupational information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT IN CHINA<|>EVENT<|>The shift in agricultural employment in China from 82% of the workforce in 1962 to 13% in 2013 illustrates significant changes in labor markets and economic structure.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>Both organizations analyze economic data and trends, with the CBO focusing on budgetary impacts and McKinsey on broader economic implications of technology.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>The McKinsey Global Institute studies the impact of generative AI on work activities and productivity, highlighting its potential economic benefits.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>The McKinsey Global Institute utilizes data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to analyze labor market trends and the impact of automation.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT IN CHINA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The shift in agricultural employment in China reflects broader trends in labor market changes that generative AI may further influence through automation.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
