Scholars and practitioners are, in particular, undecided about the general effect including its measurement and durability (Barnett 2007; Devinney 2009; Wood 2010; Orlitzky 2011; Borgers et al. 2013; Orlitzky 2013; Reynolds 2014; Authers 2015). Thus, there is an ongoing debate about the role and the impact of the financial sector on the natural environment and society (Weber 2014). In order to derive a more comprehensive picture, several review studies summarize primary ESG–CFP studies. Yet, all these first-level review studies provide an incomplete picture. This study is the first effort to provide aggregated evidence based on more than 2000 empirical studies that have been released since the 1970s (see Figure 1).\n\nWe chose a two-step research method to analyze existing review and primary studies. First, we include findings from so-called vote-count studies. Vote-count studies count the number of studies with significant positive, negative, and nonsignificant results and “votes” the category with the highest share as winner (Light and Smith 1971). These studies provide interesting insights, but are less sophisticated from a methodological point of view. The shortcomings are well documented in the literature. 1 Second, we aggregate the findings of econometric review studies – so-called meta-analyses – to derive a second-order meta-analysis.\n\nIn total, 60 review studies – both vote-count studies and meta-analyses – with a gross number of 3718 underlying studies on the empiric relation between ESG criteria and CFP provide the starting point for our second-level review study.2 When adjusted for overlaps, this figure reduces to a net number of more than 2200 unique studies. This still represents a dataset, which is 35 times.\n\n|2500|1|2000|1|1500|||1000|500| | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |1970|1975|1980|1985|1990|1995|2000|2005|2010|2015|\n\nFigure 1. Estimated number of empirical studies on the ESG–CFP relation over time.\n\nlarger than the average of analyzed primary studies in prior review studies. In this study, we explain both systematic methods of summarizing extant research and present a research symbiosis of vote-count studies and meta-analyses in the spirit of a best-evidence synthesis (Slavin 1986).\n\nThrough analyzing what is by far the most comprehensive dataset on existing ESG–CFP research to date, we find that the business case for ESG investing is empirically well founded. Investing in ESG pays financially. Furthermore, we highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP is stable over time. Based on the data, we are able to derive conclusions for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, 3 different asset classes, regions, and categories of E, S, and G. Particularly promising results are obtained when we differentiate between regions, nonportfolio studies, and asset classes other than equities.\n\n# Data\n\nSince the earliest review of vote-count ESG–CFP studies (Aldag and Bartol 1978), the studies providing secondary analysis of this relation has risen considerably, including both academic and numerous additional practitioner papers. The growth in number of ESG–CFP research publications has been particularly tremendous since the beginning of the 1990s. Based on our sample, we find that at least 2200 empirical ESG–CFP studies exist.\n\n# Search\n\nFor our analysis, only academic studies – regardless if they are working papers, published journal papers, or written for a commercial audience – were considered. Review papers that did not provide quantitative summaries of their findings were not included in our sample. Besides ancestry research and expert opinion, all relevant scholar databases and publisher sites were searched: Academy of Management Journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Sprinker Link, and Web of Science. We also searched for nonpublished material on Econbiz, NBER, Repec, and SSRN. The keyword search combinations included the three components of E, S, and G and its abbreviations. In particular, we used the search terms environment(al) (performance), social (performance), responsib(le/ility), sustainab(le/ility), human capital, (corporate) governance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance.\n\nThe first 100 hits of each single database and key word query, sorted by relevance, were further processed. Within this pre-filtered results we then searched for the terms meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. Together with the expert opinion studies, this yielded a narrower sample of 149 studies, which were analyzed in more detail by abstract or full paper. Single study designs, narrative reviews without clear tables/explicit summary results, and review studies without relevant ESG–CFP categorization were excluded. We applied a definition of ESG that reflects the exemplary list of variables of Clarkson (1995), Wood (2010), and the investment approaches in GSIA (2013). We did not differentiate whether the motives for ESG performance of the firm are for altruistic or strategic reasons (McGuire 1969; Baron 2001; McWilliams, Siegel, and Wright 2006). CFP measures were defined as accounting-based performance, market-based performance\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
