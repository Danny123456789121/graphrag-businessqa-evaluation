This result supports Hypothesis 2-1 in that researchers find a smaller impact for SRI over time and the disagreement among them has become smaller, too. The trend of finding a positive impact of SRI is followed by an average negative impact of SRI in the next decade, which is again followed by no significant influence of SRI as expected by dialectical movements of theory development.\n\nThe meta-regression results in Tables 6 and 7 further reinforce this interpretation on research trends in SRI area. The negative coefficients for the publication year variable suggest that researchers have come to obtain smaller AESs over time.\n\nAnother interesting result regarding the time dimension is shown in Table 8. During an economic crisis, investment performance is lower than it is in a normal period. SRI is not an exception in this regard. The negative coefficients of the Crisis variable indicate that papers whose sample periods include an economic crisis tend to have smaller ESs, which is consistent with Hypothesis 2-2.\n\n# 5.2.2. Publication status.\n\nWe run a random-effect meta-regression with AES as the dependent variable and dummies for publication status and statistical significance as independent variables to (Table 7), where tau23. indicates the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimate test Hypothesis Univariate (Multivariate) results are shown in Table 6 of between-study variance and I2res is a percentage of residual variation due to heterogeneity. Since more than 85% of residual variance is caused by heterogeneity, running a random-effect meta-regression is well justified.\n\nContrary to the prediction of Hypothesis 3, the sign for the publication dummy is negative and statistically significant. When combined with the statistical significance dummy, the cross-multiplication term has a negative sign, as shown in model (5) of Table 7. It suggests that among statistically significant comparisons,\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Impact of sampling moderators on absolute value of effect sizes (univariate)\n\n|Publication|Academia|Pub_year|SRP_CI|Quality|SRI_CI|AES|_cons|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|(1)|0.229 (0.077)***|0.418 (0.074)***|86.57%|0.069;|2=res| | |\n|(2)|0.008 (0.004)**|15.917 (7.905)**|86.59%|0.068;|2=res| | |\n|(3)|0.113 (0.050)**|0.304 (0.047)***|86.57%|0.069;|2=res| | |\n|(4)|0.217 (0.047)**|0.362 (0.040)***|86.50%|0.062;|2=res| | |\n|(5)|0.183 (0.052)***|0.165 (0.025)***|86.31%|0.064;|2=res| | |\n|(6)|0.353 (0.169)**|0.453 (0.076)***|93.44%|0.197;|2=res| | |\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nThis table reports multivariate meta-regression results about moderators associated with sampling issues.
