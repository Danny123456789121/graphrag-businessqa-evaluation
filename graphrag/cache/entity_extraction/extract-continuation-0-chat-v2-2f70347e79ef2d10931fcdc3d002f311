Thus, the decision about selecting this supplier is 82.245% false due to the very high importance of the economic dimension.\n\n# Supplier selection\n\n|False|82.245%|\n|---|---|\n|True|17.755%|\n\n|Soc|Env|Eco|\n|---|---|---|\n|Very Low|Very Low|41.049%|\n|Low|Very Low|Low|\n|Medium|Medium|Medium|\n|Very High|High|Very High|\n\nFigure 8. Scenario 3: low quality of service (Eco3) and high resource consumption (Env2).\n\nIn summary, the proposed model enables the decision-makers to conduct a wide variety of scenario analyses with incomplete information. The information about supplier criteria can be conflicting, and the analyses could be revised when more information becomes available. Thus, the proposed BN are validated by decision-makers according to this sensitivity analysis.\n\n# 3.5. Applying the Proposed Bayesian Network Model\n\nIn this case study, three alternative suppliers (S1, S2, S3) for a component to be purchased by the company are evaluated by the decision-makers. The manufacturer worked with supplier S1 and S2 before and they have some information from past experience. S3 is a new potential supplier with limited information from previous experience.\n\nThe offered component price by supplier S3 is USD 120. Thus, supplier S3 was assigned a medium level for criterion Eco1. The company asked S3 to send sample parts, the supplier delivered the parts on time, Eco2, and had a rejection rate &lt; 1%. Eco3 is considered “high” in this case. For S3 environmental performance, the managers do not know the total emitted CO2 (Env1) or the energy performance indicator (Env2) of supplier S3. This supplier has implemented an environmental management system in order to obtain an environmental certification (Env3). For the social dimension, this supplier did not provide any information about employment practices (Soc1) or about the number of incidents (Soc2). They indicated a social responsibility budget (Soc3) as 7% of sales.\n\nThe managers have no information about the total carbon emissions (Env2) caused by supplier S2 activities. There is also no information about energy consumption (Env2). A summary of this and other case information from suppliers S1, S2, S3 is presented in Table 12.\n\n**Table 12. Data for case Suppliers S1, S2 and S3.**\n|Criteria|S1|S2|S3|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Eco1|High|Medium|Medium|\n|Eco2|High|High|High|\n|Eco3|High|High|Very high|\n|Env1|No information|High|No information|\n|Env2|Medium|No information|No information|\n|Env3|High|No information|High|\n|Soc1|High|High|No information|\n|Soc2|Low|Medium|No information|\n|Soc3|Medium|Medium|High|\n\nWe entered the values from Table 12 into the BN model results for suppliers S1, S2, S3. The results are illustrated in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. BN model for suppliers S1, S2 and S3.\n\n# 4. Results Analysis and Managerial Implications\n\nBased on sustainable criteria evaluation using AHP, the economic factor is the most significant dimension in selecting a supplier with the highest value of priority weights W = 0.618 for DMs. This helps DMs to understand the current state of practice in sustainable supplier selection in the company and to review and update their priorities regarding sustainability criteria.\n\nOn the other hand, after sharing the priorities with partners, they will pay more attention regarding the criteria which are more important for the DMs. For instance, for supplier S1, the social responsibility budget (Soc3) is only 2% of sales and this criterion is the most important criterion under the social aspect for DMs in the evaluation of the supplier. Thus, supplier S1 should increase this percentage of Soc3 to be better evaluated.\n\nFor DMs, the lack of certain information concerning the performance of the supplies should not prevent the possibility of an adequate evaluation. The proposed BN model allowed decision-makers to evaluate the global performance of each supplier despite the missing information regarding one criterion for supplier S1, two criteria for S2 and four criteria for supplier S3.\n\nThus, based on the evidence from past experience of supplier S1, the BN model predicts medium performance (approximately 52.76%) or high performance (approximately 47.24%) of reducing pollution quantity (Env1) due to the existence of a highly ranked environmental management system (Env3). Thus, selecting S1 as a partner is approximately 75% true. This result confirms the opinions of the decision-makers.\n\nFor supplier S2, the model predicts high-level performance for energy consumption (Env2), with a probability of 78.07% and also high-level performance for environmental management system criterion (Env3) with a probability of 76.68% as it demonstrates high performance in reducing pollution criterion (Env1). Its global economic performance (Eco) is predicted to be 50.31%, a medium level, which should be improved as this criterion is the most important for DMs in this case. The final decision about selecting supplier S2 is 58.2% true and 41.7% false. Therefore, supplier S2 should improve some areas of performance in order to satisfy the requirement level as a sustainable supplier. The result reinforces the decision-maker’s opinion about supplier S2. The company knew that S2 was\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLIER S1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supplier S1 is a company evaluated for its sustainable practices and performance in various criteria including economic, environmental, and social dimensions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLIER S2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supplier S2 is another company evaluated for its sustainable practices, with some known performance metrics and areas needing improvement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLIER S3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supplier S3 is a new potential supplier with limited information from previous experience, evaluated for its component pricing and environmental management system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAYESIAN NETWORK MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The Bayesian Network Model is a proposed model used for evaluating suppliers based on various criteria despite missing information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>PERSON<|>Decision-makers are individuals responsible for evaluating suppliers and making decisions based on the analysis of sustainable criteria.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER S1<|>BAYESIAN NETWORK MODEL<|>Supplier S1's performance is evaluated using the Bayesian Network Model to assess its sustainability practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER S2<|>BAYESIAN NETWORK MODEL<|>Supplier S2's performance is evaluated using the Bayesian Network Model to assess its sustainability practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIER S3<|>BAYESIAN NETWORK MODEL<|>Supplier S3's performance is evaluated using the Bayesian Network Model to assess its sustainability practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>SUPPLIER S1<|>Decision-makers evaluate Supplier S1 based on the Bayesian Network Model and past experience<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>SUPPLIER S2<|>Decision-makers evaluate Supplier S2 based on the Bayesian Network Model and known performance metrics<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>SUPPLIER S3<|>Decision-makers evaluate Supplier S3 based on the Bayesian Network Model despite limited information<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
