For example, Bear, Rahman, & Post (2010) document that board gender diversity is positively associated with firms’ corporate social responsibility rankings and firm reputation as measured using Fortune Magazine’s “Most Admired Companies” list.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Under SEC rules, any shareholder holding shares worth at least $2,000 (or one percent of the market value of equity) for a year or more is allowed to submit a proposal for inclusion in a company’s proxy statement distributed for its annual shareholder meeting.\n\nGillan and Starks (2007) provide a summary of the history of shareholder activism and document the increasing prevalence and importance of shareholder proposals as a means of shaping corporate governance.\n\nWhile in the past shareholders had typically targeted firms that were underperforming or poorly governed (Karpoff, Malatesta, & Walking, 1996), shareholder activism more recently addresses perceived deficiencies in corporate social responsibilities, including issues related to the environment, corporate political activities, or human rights violations. Increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards is one such social issue that activists have pursued with increasing frequency, with over 75 shareholder proposals calling for greater diversity filed since 2013.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nAs mentioned above, both agency theory and institutional theory have been brought to bear on questions related to shareholder activism. A prime example is Judge et al. (2010), who demonstrate in a multi-country study that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary with the motivation of the activist, with agency theory providing valid predictions for financially-motivated activism and institutional theory providing stronger explanations for socially-motivated activism. We thus draw upon both theoretical perspectives in developing our hypotheses.\n\n# The Antecedents of Shareholder Activism Related to Gender Diversity\n\nPrior research has examined the firm characteristics of female board representation. For example, Hillman et al. (2007) find that firms with female directors are larger and more organizationally complex, have more directors who sit on other boards with female directors, and are in industries with a higher proportion of women in the workforce, and Adams and Ferreira (2009) report that firms with female directors are larger, have more business segments, have larger boards, have worse performance in terms of Tobin’s Q (market value of assets over book value of assets) but better performance in terms of return on assets (ROA). However, we are the first, to our knowledge, to examine the antecedents of shareholder activism directed toward increasing female board representation. We therefore start with the most fundamental question of whether the existing level of female representation on the BOD plays a role in activists’ decisions to formally submit proposals calling for increased gender diversity.\n\nIt would seem self-evident that shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity will tend to target firms with low existing levels of female board representation, as activists target firms where problems are perceived as greatest and where the potential benefits of change are perceived as being high (Ertimur, Ferri, & Muslu, 2011). Because firms with low\n\nfemale presentation would stand out relative to their peers, we expect them to be more likely to be targeted by shareholder activists than firms with high female representation. However, shareholder activists driven by ideological concerns may be less discriminating in their choice of target firms. In the extreme, such activists might target all firms where there is any gender imbalance on the board, which would constitute virtually all firms in the S&P 1500.\n\nFinancially-motivated activists may only be pursuing gender diversity goals merely to satisfy demands from clients rather than from a sincere desire to impact board composition, in which case the existing level of representation may not be the primary factor in choosing a target. To the extent that these alternative possibilities hold, this will attenuate the expected relation between existing female representation and shareholder activism, potentially resulting in no association between the two. We nonetheless offer a directional hypothesis related to existing female representation:\n\n# Hypothesis 1a.\n\nHigher existing levels of female board representation reduce the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity.\n\nWe further consider how activist motivations might affect the relation between the level of female representation and the likelihood of being targeted. Within the institutional theory framework, increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards would increase the firm’s social legitimacy and is thus typically viewed as a socially-motivated shareholder activist objective. However, the agency theory perspective on board diversity suggests that financially-motivated activists would also have an interest in improving gender diversity, as there is empirical evidence (cited above) that suggests that the presence of female directors improves the board’s ability to effectively monitor the firm’s managers. These findings are also consistent with Cohen, Pant, & Sharp (1998), who provide evidence that women display a higher ethical sensitivity – i.e., they are more likely to identify a questionable action as unethical, and less likely to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FORTUNE MAGAZINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fortune Magazine is a publication known for its rankings, including the “Most Admired Companies” list which evaluates firms' reputations and corporate social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ETHISPHERE MAGAZINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ethisphere Magazine publishes the “World's Most Ethical Companies” list, recognizing firms for their ethical practices and corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>EVENT<|>Gender diversity refers to the representation of women on corporate boards and is a focus of shareholder activism aimed at improving corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>EVENT<|>Shareholder activism involves efforts by shareholders to influence a company's policies and practices, often focusing on issues like corporate governance and social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>EVENT<|>Female board representation is the presence of women on corporate boards, which is linked to various corporate performance metrics and is a target for shareholder activism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENCY THEORY<|>EVENT<|>Agency theory is a framework that explains the relationship between principals (shareholders) and agents (company executives), often used to analyze corporate governance issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL THEORY<|>EVENT<|>Institutional theory examines how institutional environments influence organizational behavior, including the motivations behind shareholder activism.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>Shareholder activism increasingly targets gender diversity on corporate boards as a social issue that activists pursue<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORTUNE MAGAZINE<|>ETHISPHERE MAGAZINE<|>Both magazines publish lists that rank companies based on their reputation and ethical practices, influencing corporate governance standards<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>Female board representation is a key aspect of gender diversity initiatives that shareholder activists aim to improve<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGENCY THEORY<|>INSTITUTIONAL THEORY<|>Both theories provide frameworks for understanding the motivations behind shareholder activism, with agency theory focusing on financial motivations and institutional theory on social legitimacy<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
