Information on CSR is likely to make good stories, and it is reasonable to consider that soft news on ESG issues and the emotive language associated are more appealing for a large audience than hard information on company’s financial statements for instance.\n\nExtensive media coverage might also be explained by the fact that ESG news are ‘‘blue-compatible’’. Empirical evidence suggests that Democrats (the ‘‘blues’’), in contrast to Republicans (‘‘the reds’’), are more apt to support causes such as environmental and labor protection, and they are more supportive of the stakeholder theory. For instance, Hong and Kostovetsky (2012) find that mutual fund managers who make campaign donations to Democrats hold less of their portfolios in industries that are deemed socially irresponsible (based on KLD ratings). Moreover, news media seems to be biased toward liberal ideas; see Groseclose and Milyo (2005) for empirical evidence from the USA. All together, this is consistent with the heavy weight news media give to ESG issues.\n\nDoes it pay to be good? There is an extensive academic literature on the relationship between CSR and firms value, using a wide variety of empirical methodologies (event studies, impact on Tobin’s Q or firm profitability, portfolio analysis, etc.). While these studies provide mixed results, most of the surveys (including several meta-analyses) suggest a positive correlation between CSR and measures of firm performance, such as profit (Margolis and Walsh 2003; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Scholtens 2008; Margolis et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2016).\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, however, as pointed by MacWilliams and Siegel (2000), marginal costs and benefits of CSR should offset each other in equilibrium, and consequently, the relationship between CSR and financial performance should be neutral. Moreover, the fact that ESG news are more and more frequent does not mean that they have a significant impact on firms’ market value. Being a media hype is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for being a market mover. ESG news are often considered as soft news. This is a clear advantage to attract media attention and readers, but at the same time, it is somehow a drawback from the investors’ point of view, because soft news are more difficult to process (Demers and Vega 2010). Thus, for instance, Orlitzky (2013) challenges the conventional wisdom about the net benefits of CSR and argues that ESG news may harm stock markets: ‘‘market signals about CSR [are] full of, and in fact generating new, noise because of (a) the ambivalent impact of CSR on an organization’s economic performance and (b) information asymmetry in financial markets, resulting in large part from managerial opportunism (p. 240).’’\n\nThus, the common view is that ESG news impact firm value, although some doubts have not been allayed. That is, we first test a general but fundamental hypothesis:\n\n# H 1 ESG news have a significant impact on firms’ market value.\n\nThe carrot or the stick? Our second hypothesis is related to the (a)symmetry of the impact of ESG news. Previous research in behavioral economics has shown that responses to positive and negative economic information are asymmetric (Schepers 2006).\n\nHistorically, investor awareness on ESG issues emerged with the rejection of ‘‘sin stocks.’’ Practices have evolved,\n\n# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\nFig. 1 CSR in the news.\n\n|Year|Corporate Social Responsibility (left scale)|Corporate Social Responsibility Finance (right scale)|\n|---|---|---|\n|1990|5000|1.0%|\n|1991|4500|0.9%|\n|1992|4000|0.8%|\n|1993|3500|0.7%|\n|1994|3000|0.6%|\n|1995|2500|0.5%|\n|1996|2000|0.4%|\n|1997|1500|0.3%|\n|1998|1000|0.2%|\n|1999|500|0.1%|\n|2000| |0.0%|\n|2001| | |\n|2002| | |\n|2003| | |\n|2004| | |\n|2005| | |\n|2006| | |\n|2007| | |\n|2008| | |\n|2009| | |\n|2010| | |\n\nand nowadays socially responsible investors use generally both negative and positive screens. Still, the punishment seems intuitively more powerful and prevalent than the reward (Bird et al. 2007). According to previous studies, it is reasonable to assume that negative news have more impact in magnitude than positive ones. For instance, Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) find that positive stock returns after positive news are smaller, in absolute value, than negative stock returns after negative news. Similarly, Krueger (2015) finds that negative ESG events are followed by a stock price decrease, while the impact of positive ESG events is somewhat ambivalent and depends on the quality of the relations between the firms and their stakeholders. Note, however, that Flammer (2013) finds a significant effect, both for eco-friendly and eco-harmful corporate behaviors.\n\nSo, does it pay less to be good than it costs to be bad? As stated by Mattingly and Berman (2006), positive and negative social actions are both empirically and conceptually distinct (see also Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). In particular, ESG-positive events are more diverse in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
