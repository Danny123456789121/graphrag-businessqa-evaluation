For example, Edlich et al. (2018) highlighted the incorporation of chatbots and cognitive agents in HR service centres that responded to employee inquiries, managed benefits administration, and oversaw record-keeping. In this given context, employees can benefit from on-demand access to information, resources, and services. Additionally, the resulting analytics can help drive better decision-making of leaders and yield improved HRM support thereby impacting employment relations. An important variable that is likely to moderate employment relations using ChatGPT-enabled interfaces is trust.\n\nGiven that trust is a central factor in the employee-employer relationship (Yadav et al., 2022), employment relations is likely to be moderated through the use of ChatGPT interfaces insomuch as employees view the technology as an appropriately leveraged, capable, and trusted resource. To explore some of its limitations, Figure 2 exhibits ChatGPT’s response to an inquiry, “Can I trust you?” In response, the model indicates several of its limitations.\n\n# Employee Wellbeing\n\nAnother notable example of an AI-enabled chatbot is Woebot, a commercially available conversational agent that uses cognitive-behavioural therapy to provide mental health support to its users (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). During a randomized control trial, participants in the treatment group (which used Woebot as a therapeutic intervention for 2 weeks) reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). While Woebot is not a ChatGPT-enabled application, its function is illustrative of the potential impact ChatGPT can have on employee wellbeing, as it relates to mental health. Figure 3 illustrates ChatGPT's response to the prompt, “I feel depressed.” The model first expresses empathy. Then it notes its limitations and subsequently offers general recommendations.\n\nConversely, the integration of ChatGPT into the workplace may also negatively affect employee wellbeing. For instance, the integration of ChatGPT may increase anxiety for employees concerned about job insecurity (OpenAI, 2023). Figure 4 illustrates ChatGPT's response to the user prompt, “I am worried about how the integration of ChatGPT will lead to the loss of my job.” Again, the model expresses empathy before offering suggestions.\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\n# Can I trust you?\n\nAs an AI language model, I am designed to provide information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on the data I have been trained on. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind when using AI like me:\n\n1. Knowledge limitations: My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which goes up until September 2021. I may not have the most up-to-date information, and my knowledge of specific subjects might be limited.\n2. Misinterpretation: I might sometimes misunderstand your questions or provide answers that don't fully address your concerns. This can be due to the complexity of language and the limitations of AI understanding.\n3. Bias: Although efforts have been made to minimize bias in my training data, I might still inadvertently display some biases present in the text I have been trained on.\n4. Not a substitute for professionals: While I can provide general information and advice on various topics, I am not a substitute for consulting with professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, or financial advisors.\n\nYou can trust me to provide general information and answer questions to the best of my ability; but it's always a good idea to verify information, especially when it comes to critical decisions or matters that require expert guidance.\n\n# FIGURE 2\n\nChatGPT response to prompt regarding trust.\n\n# Employee Engagement\n\nLike employee wellbeing, ChatGPT may likely influence employee engagement both positively and negatively. AI and generative models like ChatGPT can enhance the efforts of human workers in a myriad of ways ranging from upskilling in call centres to providing help with writing to providing on-demand resources (Cheng et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023). The outcomes of this AI augmentation can be positive for workers as they may yield opportunities for empowerment, creative exploration, increased efficiency, and fulfilment. These outcomes, in turn, may enhance motivation and overall job satisfaction. Researchers have established that perceived satisfaction is related to engagement (Cheng et al., 2022). In this way, the adoption of ChatGPT has the potential to enhance employee engagement.\n\nHowever, OpenAI (2023) has called attention to the possibility of increased inequality and disparate impact that may result from the use of ChatGPT. The possibility of job displacement or the redefinition of roles may differentially impact employees. Employees may also struggle to adapt to new processes. These challenges may result in employees' wasted time, feelings of frustration, and distrust. In this way, the use of ChatGPT can be expected to negatively impact employee engagement.\n\nfeel depressed\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're feeling depressed: It's important to remember that I am an AI language model and not a mental health professional; but I can still offer some general suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Reach out to someone: Talk to a friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts with someone you trust can provide relief.\n2. Develop a routine: Create a daily schedule that includes time for work, self-care, and leisure. Maintaining a routine can provide structure and help you feel more in control of your life.\n3. Engage in physical activity: Regular exercise can boost your mood and help relieve stress. Even just going for a walk can be beneficial.\n4.
