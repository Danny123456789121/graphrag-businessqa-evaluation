We find that stocks of firms with higher total carbon dioxide emissions (and changes in emissions) earn higher returns, controlling for size, book-to-market, and other return predictors. We cannot explain this carbon premium through differences in unexpected profitability or other known risk factors. We also find that institutional investors implement exclusionary screening based on direct emission intensity (the ratio of total emissions to sales) in a few salient industries. Overall, our results are consistent with an interpretation that investors are already demanding compensation for their exposure to carbon emission risk.\n\n# JEL classification:\n\nG12, G23, G30, D62\n\n# Keywords\n\nCarbon emissions, Climate change, Stock returns, Institutional investors\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nMany studies seek to explain the cross-sectional pattern of stock returns based on exposures to aggregate risk factors such as size and book-to-market ratios, or firm-specific risk linked to observable firm characteristics. One variable that has so far been missing from the analysis is corporate carbon emissions. This omission may be for historical reasons, as concerns over global warming linked to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from human activity have only recently become salient. But, both the evidence\n\n* We thank Jawad Addoum, Franklin Allen, Eric Bouyé, Kent Daniel, Charles Donovan, Elyse Douglas, Gerry Garvey, Lukasz Pomorski, Ailsa Roell, Zacharias Sautner, Gireesh Shrimali, Michela Verardo, Jeff Wurgler, and the referee for helpful suggestions.

First, the Paris COP 21 climate agreement of December 2015, with 195 signatories committing to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Second, the rising engagement of the finance industry with climate change, largely as a result of the call to non-governmental actors to join the fight against climate change at the COP 21. Institutional investors are increasingly tracking the greenhouse gas emissions of listed firms and forming coalitions such as Climate Action 100+ to engage with companies to reduce their carbon emissions.1 More and more asset owners are following the lead of the Church of England Pension Fund, whose stated goal is “to demonstrate transparently that it has delivered on its commitment to be aligned to the Paris Agreement.”2\n\nEven if the US has pulled out of the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration, and even if the commitments of the other remaining signatories are only partially credible, major curbs in CO2 emissions are likely to be introduced over the next decade. Primarily affected by these curbs are the companies with operations generating high CO2 emissions, or with activities linked to companies in the value chain that have high CO2 emissions. In light of these developments, one would expect to see the risk with respect to carbon emissions to be reflected in the cross-section of stock returns. Yet, considerable skepticism remains, not least in the US where the Trump administration had worked to upend regulations that limit CO2 emissions. For example, Darren Woods, ExxonMobil’s CEO, recently declared that “Individual companies setting targets and then selling assets to another company so that their portfolio has a different carbon intensity has not solved the problem for the world.” And that ExxonMobil was “taking\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
