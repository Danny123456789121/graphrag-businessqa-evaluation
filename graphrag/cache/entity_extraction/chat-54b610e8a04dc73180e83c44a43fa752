Conclusions\n\nThis study’s goal is to propose a corporate sustainability framework that is more resilient than prior models and, to rank relevant criteria to the degree that could help develop a corporate sustainability model. This study is grounded in previous studies and showed the interconnected relations of sustainability and the relevance of considering stakeholders [107]. In meeting the objectives of this study we have multiple contributions to the field of sustainable business practices; (1) to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria as part of a new integrated framework; (2) provide a methodology to help organize and understand a dynamic context for sustainable business practices; (3) extend our understanding of social sustainability by also exploring and finding new insights regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe were able to identify several sustainability attributes from literature, which allowed for an analysis of prior studies and the identification of sustainability attributes, which is also supported by experts’ assessments. As a result, 45 sustainability sub-criteria were developed and ranked according to the main nine categories of Corporate Governance, Transparency and Communication, Product Responsibility, Environment, Social, Economics, Natural Environment and Climate Change, Energy Consumption and Saving and, for the very first time, we have included Pandemic as an important criterion in the development of corporate sustainability model. These criteria help to develop a new integrative framework of social sustainability. Additional contributions of this study include the application of a Fuzzy Delphi and FAHP methodology, and the computation of nine main criteria and 45 sub-criteria. These criteria provide a more dynamic assessment of the interrelated social dimensions that have in the past been looked at individually and as environmental impacts of firms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new insights include the Pandemic, along with Economic and Corporate Governance are top-ranked criteria to focus on improving corporate sustainability practices. Whereas, emergency response plan, social distance and modification in the number of working hours, commitment to climate changes, and JIT and lean delivery emerged in the top-ranked sub-criteria.\n\nThe outcomes of our work lead us to call for more action from decision-makers and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
