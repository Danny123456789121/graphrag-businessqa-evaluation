It might be anticipated that individuals with robust digital competencies, along with skills such as creativity and teamwork, which are more challenging for machines to mimic, will benefit from an AI revolution. It may also lead to the creation of more ‘bullshit jobs, that is ‘… a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence’ (Graeber, 2018, p. 9), in this instance carrying out basic bureaucratic work and petty decision making necessitated by all the new information of variable quality that might be generated through AI. Future research studies in this area could examine the antecedents influencing generative AI adoption among employees and cross-functional teams within organisations. It is also important to understand the new categories of jobs and tasks within HRM, and how existing roles and responsibilities will be either displaced or become completely redundant, and how AI may in fact make new and potentially meaningless work through supplying a plethora of marginally useful information and points for action.\n\nThe use of generative AI in HRM may require new skills from HR professionals, as well as other employees. For example, employees may need to learn how to use new generative AI tools for training, development, and performance management. HR professionals may need to develop new skills related to data analysis, algorithmic decision-making, and ethical considerations. HRM programmes may need to incorporate new content related to the use of generative AI, including topics such as data analytics, algorithmic decision-making, and ethical considerations. HRM students may also need to develop skills related to using generative AI-based tools and systems and be aware of the potential limitations related to their use. One of the major issues of AI is that a lack of information often results in information being concocted. This may be due to inherent intelligence or simply because it is built into the algorithm. If the latter, inherent in the design of AI is the deliberate generation of wrong information; this raises the risks of decisions being made based on falsehoods.\n\n# 6.2 Theme 2: Business productivity\n\nPast reports have shown that organisations face myriad challenges to integrate AI systems within their existing business processes, which often do not lead to promised business gains (Deloitte, 2017; The Economist, 2020). We expect organisations to face similar issues with generative AI tools. While we are yet to solve the problems related AI integration, businesses are likely to be cautious on adopting GAI due to six reasons: (1) huge capital investment and uncertainty on returns; (2) data infrastructure and volume of training data required to power GAI applications; (3) human resource skills, capabilities and mindset needed to collaboratively work with GAI assistants; (4) reliability of generative AI recommendations to redesign and reconfigure existing business practices; (5) potential security breaches; and (6) (perhaps most importantly) the unknown consequences that the usage of AI may hold. While untested claims have been made on the potential positive impact of generative AI tools on business productivity, we should learn from some of the recent developments in the emerging technology sphere. For example, blockchain was hugely overhyped; the platform TradeLens, provided by IBM and used by Maersk to optimise logistics processes involved in global trade, was discontinued due to lack of adoption by supply chain partners (Maersk Press Release, 2022). Moreover, proof of work blockchain is energy intensive – and inefficient – and has an enormous carbon footprint. Proof of stake blockchain is in turn, dependent on the crypto stakes being tendered being seen as worth anything. Similarly, the hype created by metaverse was also short-lived as Meta, Disney, Snapchat and Microsoft closed their division and abandoned existing projects (Quiroz-Gutierrez, 2023). While generative AI applications have the potential to become a gamechanger in certain sectors such as digital marketing and communications, information management, and education, it is still unclear how this new family of AI can create productivity at both organisational and employee levels. Managers need to strategically orchestrate resources to turn generative AI capability into valuable and resilient business outcomes. However, limited knowledge and understanding on how to achieve productivity using generative AI warrants further investigation.\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 43\n\nThere is a difficult trade-off between on the one hand, adopting a major technological advance too late, and losing out to competitors, and, on the other hand, falling for hype and adopting a largely untried “solution” that may consume vastly more resources than its capacity to create value. Here it is worth noting that a body of opinion holds that, to date, AI does not exhibit the characteristics of autonomous intelligence at all (Broussard, 2018; Schweizer, 2022). Why this matter is that we do not know what has been built into the design of AI systems. For example, a capacity to falsify or lie may simply be a mechanism designed to provide speedy solutions through shortcuts; this raises serious questions about the ethics of designers and whether obvious untrustworthiness in one area is bound to be followed by still greater untrustworthiness in others.\n\n# 6.3 | Theme 3: Sustainable HRM and productivity\n\nThe existing research has reported that adoption of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies such as cloud computing, AI, internet-of-things, and additive manufacturing can influence circular economy business models within organisations to achieve sustainable business performance (Dey et al., 2023; Luthra et al., 2020). Irrespective of these developments, we are no-where close to achieving net zero goals\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
