We repeat this analysis for a further sample of over 31,000 articles in elite business journals during the same time period to determine if our results are specific to finance journals, or are more broadly representative of accounting, economics, management and other business journals. Content analysis is a widely used method for characterising published textual material through simple quantitative descriptors such as the frequency of occurrence of a defined set of ‘codes’. The codes are linked to specific words, phrases or meanings of the textual content. Content analysis has recently been applied to large samples of journal articles to identify the disciplines, methods and concepts of energy-related social science (D’Agostino et al. 2011), the main findings of research on smart home technologies (Wilson et al. 2015) and the constituent types of low-carbon behaviour (Karlin et al. 2014).\n\nWe find a minimal level of engagement of finance and business journals with climate change-related and climate finance-related research, and we develop arguments as to why this might be the case. We conclude that this research gap is a major issue for advancing theory and practice in climate finance given the importance of finance research in shaping the modern financial system, in influencing investors and market participants and in teaching the next\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260\n\ngeneration of finance, investment, and business leaders. In so doing, we build on previous findings that business academics up to 2008 were slow to embrace climate change as a field of enquiry, although this research did not consider climate finance explicitly (Patenaude 2011; Goodall 2008).\n\n# 2 Method: content analysis\n\nWe identified leading finance journals ranked B and above (Currie and Pandher 2011) and elite business journals rated 4* (ABS 2015). The samples comprised 21 finance journals (Table 1) and 29 elite business journals spanning accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing and operations research (Table 2). The top three finance journals were included in both samples (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies).\n\nWe used Scopus to search the content of these journals for articles on climate change (‘climate’ OR ‘global warming’ OR ‘greenhouse’ OR ‘carbon’). We searched titles, abstracts and keywords in all article types. The search period covered a 17.5-year period from January 1998 to June 2015. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in December 1997 and provides a clear milestone in international climate policy including the formation of carbon markets. All the journals in our two samples were indexed by Scopus over the full search period with three exceptions (Review of Finance, Quantitative Finance and Journal of Financial Research). Coverage of these journals in Scopus began in 2004, 2003 and 2003 respectively. We used journals’ own websites to search for articles in the period from January 1998 to these start dates to ensure no missing data.\n\nA total of 36 articles in finance journals and 156 articles in elite business journals matched our search terms on climate change. We compiled metadata on all these articles and checked for spurious matches. Over half of all articles were spurious and not related to climate change (e.g. referring to a ‘changing economic climate’). Two members of the research team (IDR, BR) independently carried out these checks, with inter-coder reliability (Krippendorff’s alpha) of 0.8854. A bootstrap procedure generates lower and upper 95% CI of 0.7799 and 0.9600 respectively. Any coding differences were checked by the third member of the research team (CW) and resolved.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our final samples comprised 12 articles in finance journals (after rejecting 24 spurious matches) and 74 articles in elite business journals (after rejecting 82 spurious matches).\n\nTo determine whether the articles in these final samples were related to climate finance, we searched the compiled metadata using a set of financial terms (‘financ*’ OR ‘balance sheet’ OR ‘asset’ OR ‘valu*’ OR ‘market’ OR ‘trade’ OR ‘trading’ OR ‘securit*’). A total of 12 (of 12) articles in leading finance journals and 25 (of 74) articles in elite business journals matched our climate finance-related search terms.\n\nWe coded each of these climate finance articles using a simple coding template which distinguishes key finance topics: (A) carbon markets; (B) value and performance (including stranded assets, green funds); (C) risk and risk mitigation (including hedging and insurance); (D) investments and opportunities (including green bonds); (E) corporate strategies (including carbon accounting, socially responsible investment) and (F) other (including carbon taxes, public climate finance). These topics were initially derived from an iterative process of reading the climate finance literature and reconciling this with established areas of finance research (for instance, commodity markets for topic A, risk management and insurance for topic C).
