Hence, the choice of time lag is no means for selective reporting of results. Overall, the analysis provides no evidence for publication selection bias.\n\n# 4.3 Robustness test and of heterogeneity\n\nAs already noted, hitherto unobserved heterogeneity (as incorporated in the random effects component τ2 in previous analyses) is present in the field of the CEP–CFP relation. This is also empirically confirmed by the statistically significant heterogeneity test statistics displayed in Tables 1 and 2. The subsequent analysis of heterogeneity sheds light on the main reasons of differences across studies. Therefore, we first derive various moderating variables based on information from primary studies, which might cause the heterogeneity among the effect sizes. For the choice and design of variables, we follow prior meta‐analyses.\n\n# FIGURE 2\n\nFunnel plots.
