As shown, these vary across the income groups: the higher the per capita income of a country, the greater its urbanization level, per capita energy use and emissions. In 1975, the degree of urbanization was 72% in high-income countries, only 24% in low-income countries and 48% in middle-income countries. In addition, per capita energy use and emissions of the high-income group in 1975 and 2005 were also significantly higher than for the other income groups.
