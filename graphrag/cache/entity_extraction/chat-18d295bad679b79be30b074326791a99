Broadly, responses or management strategies can be categorized as proactive versus defensive (Hahn et al., 2018; Iivonen, 2018). Three major distinctions have been made between the two types. First, active response requires acknowledging the existence of paradoxes and the correlation between their conflicting elements (Lewis and Smith, 2014), whereas a defensive response involves actors who often deny or ignore the existence of such contradictions. Second, proactively responding actors regard it as feasible to achieve multiple contradictory goals at the same time, whereas those with a defensive strategy tend to divert or eliminate the tension between economic, environmental, and social demands (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015). Third, actors adopting proactive responses often propose or make a fundamental change or a deviation from the existing stable state, while defensive responses constitute only a minor “natural extension” (Iivonen, 2018, p. 318) of the existing pattern.\n\n# TABLE 3\n\nRepresentative article\nSharma and Jaiswal (2018)\nFerns et al.

(2020)\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org | November 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579272\n\n# Luo et al.\n\n# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\n# Proactive strategies\n\nProactive strategies encompass two critical components, differentiation and integration (Poole and Van de Ven, 1989; Smith and Tushman, 2005; Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009; Smith, 2014). Differentiation includes spatial and temporal separations of competing elements within different boundaries (Smith et al., 2013). For example, the segmentation mechanism divides partnerships into sub-tracks, which then act as intermediaries among cross-departmental partners to buffer conflicts (Stadtler, 2018). Moreover, by separating and differently managing stakeholders’ benefits and expectations, a hybrid organization could successfully navigate between “community-focused” and “client-focused” orientations (Kannothra et al., 2018). For integration, previous work highlights the role of linking mechanisms (Hahn et al., 2016). A structural design, such as a hybrid set of members of the board (Bruneel et al., 2020), could combine business and social logics, and formal processes that regulate cross-function interaction (Battilana et al., 2015) could facilitate coordination and resource exchange. The authors observe that integration mechanisms are specifically addressed by some multinational enterprises. For example, Acquier et al. (2018) observe the international Japanese enterprise processes in multi-functional teams and cross-regional CSR projects to achieve highly integrated CSR, namely, increased professionalization and globalization, worldwide coordination, and the institutionalization of CSR. Some researchers argue that both differentiation and integration are indispensable for the organization (Smith and Tushman, 2005; Smith and Lewis, 2011) and can be utilized ambidextrously to produce a synergistic effect. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) came up with a segmenting–bridging–demarcating loop whereby both integration and differentiation are applied to daily work.
