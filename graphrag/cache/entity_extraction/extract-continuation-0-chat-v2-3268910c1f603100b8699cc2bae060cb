Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nCorp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 2018 DOI: 10.1002/csr\n\n# T. Busch and G. Friede\n\nLike the first-order meta-analytical predecessor methodology (Hunter et al., 1982; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004), second-order meta-analysis is also a fully random effect model.\n\n# The Search Process\n\nWe included a CSP-CFP meta-analysis in our sample insofar the applied CSP definition of meta-analysis matched the CSP understanding expressed by Wood (2010) and Clarkson (1995). Wood (2010, p. 64) argued for ‘CSP as an overarching, multi-dimensional construct’ where vast literature on organizational culture, managerial decision-making, or employee relations practices ‘waits to be brought into the field of CSP’. Also, Clarkson (1995) outlined a diverse set of social and stakeholder issues. He included, for example, employee-related aspects like compensation/rewards, training and development, employment equity, and employee communication. We follow their line of reasoning and have also included meta-analyses beyond a narrow CSP focus. These are, for instance, CEP, ethical corporate governance, and broader employee-related aspects. We did not differentiate as to whether the motives for firm CSP were altruistic or strategic (Baron, 2001; J. W. McGuire, 1969; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). In terms of CFP, the studies needed to consider at least one of the following categories: accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk, or the performance of CSP mutual funds/indices. In cases where the entire meta-analysis was beyond this scope, we extracted only the relevant parts of the whole analysis. Meta-analyses with probit- or logit-correlations were excluded, as transformations to the r-family of correlations result in effect sizes with too large sampling errors. Non-standardized effects, which could not be classified as CSP-CFP sub-effects, were also disregarded for this second-order meta-analysis. Our cut-off date for study inclusion was December 2014. All studies needed to be available in electronic format.\n\nInitially, we applied ancestry research, using widely cited meta- and review studies to extract their cited predecessor studies. The sample was subsequently extended with a forward search in Google Scholar looking for potentially relevant cross-references of so far unknown studies. After that, we performed searches in relevant databases and publisher sites: Academy of Management journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, and Wiley, and also searched for non-published manuscripts on Econbiz, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), and Social Science Research Network (SSRN). We used several search combinations and variations of the term ‘Corporate Social Performance’ including (corporate) sustainability, (corporate) social responsibility, (corporate) governance, (corporate) environmental performance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance. Of all database queries, we further processed the first 100 hits sorted by relevance. The raw data set of several thousand studies was first reduced for overlapping search hits, and second searched for keywords in the remaining results. We searched for meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. This yielded an overall raw sample of 149 working papers and studies which were analyzed in more detail by examining the abstract or full paper. Seventy-six studies were dropped in the next step, because they either did not contain a relevant CSP-CFP categorization or were single-study designs. The remaining studies were narrowed to the final sample of 25 studies by the exclusion of: (1) 47 narrative reviews and vote-count studies; and (2) meta-studies with non-transferable effect sizes and different paper versions. If different versions of meta-studies with comparable data sets were identified, the latest version remained in our sample. Our search was open to meta-analyses in all asset classes, but it was not possible to locate meta-studies that analyzed other objects than equities. Thus, published (primary) research of the CSP effect in corporate bonds, real estate, and private equity is not considered, as we could not yet identify dedicated meta-analyses.\n\n# Sample\n\nOur total sample consists of 25 meta-analyses which combined yield a gross number (n m) of 1,902 primary studies. It aggregates 4,507 separate effects (k m) and nearly a million observations (N m = 992,239) (Table 1). Apart from the meta-analytical summary effects, we obtained 129 CSP-CFP sub-effects of first-order meta-analyses, combining in total 2,387,215 observations. Besides the summary and sub-effects at the meta-level, we extracted all provided data at primary study level. Adjusted for overlapping studies and primary studies which either were not made.\n\nFurther details are provided in online Supplementary Appendix SA.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.
