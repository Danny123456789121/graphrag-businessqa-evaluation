During data collection, the inclusion criteria for relevance (see above) served as constant checks on the operationalizations’ conformance to the broad conceptual definitions of CSP and CFP.\n\nEmpirically, the standard deviation of ρ serves as an indicator of cross-study heterogeneity. The percentage of cross-study variance explained by artefacts is another indicator of the degree of cross-study generalizability (Hunter and Schmidt 1990).\n\n# Statistical Conventions Used in the Meta-analysis\n\nThe meta-analysis uses Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) statistical aggregation techniques for cumulating correlations and correcting for various study artefacts in order to estimate the true score correlation (ρ) between CSP and CFP. Meta-analysis arrives at a mean true-score correlation by correcting observed correlations for sampling error (which can be written as σe = (1−ρ2) / (N−1)) and for measurement error. Since sampling error varies directly with sample size, all studies are weighted by sample size Ni before correcting for the average attenuation factor (Schmidt and Hunter 1977).\n\nBecause measurement error data points are not always available for individual studies (see Appendix A), study correlations cannot be corrected individually for measurement error. Instead, correlations are meta-analysed using artefact distributions (for more details on artefact-distribution meta-analysis, see Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The moderator analyses use Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) subgrouping algorithm, as described in the Results section below.\n\nNon-independence in any meta-analytic data set can present certain problems. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted by using two other aggregation techniques. In the first sensitivity analysis, we used only one independent correlation per study, that is, composite scores. Furthermore, a second sensitivity analysis tested the stability of our transformations of effect sizes (reported t or d statistics into r).\n\n# Results\n\n# Overall CSP–CFP Relationships\n\nAs shown in the first line of Table 1, the mean observed correlation (robs) for the total set of 388 correlations and a total sample size N of 33,878.\n\n# Organization Studies 24(3)\n\n# File Drawer\n\nRefers to percentage of cross-study observed variance explained by three study artefacts: sampling error, measurement error in CSP, measurement error in CFP.\n\n| |1,037|139|897|17| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Analysis Variance of| | | |down to .05.| |\n|ρ|(2|.1896|.0641|.1891|.1097|\n|σ|[|ρ| | | |\n|True-|r| | |Findings needed to bring| |\n|‘ r|Score(mean|.3648|.1543|.4671|.1246|\n|Mean| |23.89|43.94|27.04|40.33|\n|Explained Variance %| |.0646|.0296|.0638|.0383|\n|Sample-Size Observed Variance|(obs|.1836|.0776|.2301|.0562|\n|Sample Weighted r|(r| | | | |\n\n# Table 1.

The study artefacts of sampling and measurement error in CSP and CFP explain 24 percent of the cross-study variance of robs. After correction for sampling and measurement errors, the true score (corrected) correlation (ρ) was .36, which is twice the size of the observed correlation, with a variance (.19), which is slightly more than three times the size of the observed variance. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the relationship remains positive even after we removed studies that may be affected by response bias (survey measures of CFP) and halo (CSP reputation indices; Brown and Perry 1994); the remaining meta-analytic set showed an average observed correlation of .08 and a true-score correlation of .15. Although this true-score correlation is smaller than in the larger set including CSP reputation and CFP survey measures, it is not trivial. Thus, the meta-analytic findings support hypothesis H1.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses tend to confirm this conclusion. The first sensitivity analysis, which uses only one effect size per study (thus, k = 52, N = 4924), showed a mean observed correlation of .21 and a corrected correlation of .42. The second sensitivity analysis, on 210 product-moment correlations (k) with a total sample size of 22,218 observations (N), also showed slightly higher estimates (robs = .20, ρ = .41) than the overall meta-analysis reported in Table 1. Thus, in both ‘sensitivity’ meta-analyses (not reported in the tables), the mean observed and corrected correlations were positive and of similar magnitude as the correlations in the entire meta-analytic set. If anything, the sensitivity analyses suggest that our meta-analytic estimates are actually conservative estimates of the relationships between CSP and CFP\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>PERSON<|>Hunter and Schmidt are researchers known for their work on statistical aggregation techniques in meta-analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky et al. conducted a study on corporate social and financial performance, contributing to the meta-analytic findings discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>EVENT<|>CSP refers to the performance of a corporation in relation to social issues and responsibilities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>EVENT<|>CFP refers to the financial performance of a corporation, often measured through various financial metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine results from multiple studies to identify patterns or overall effects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMPLING ERROR<|>EVENT<|>Sampling error is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population, affecting the accuracy of statistical estimates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEASUREMENT ERROR<|>EVENT<|>Measurement error refers to the difference between the actual value and the value obtained through measurement, impacting data quality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Sensitivity analysis is a method used to predict the outcome of a decision given a certain range of variables.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Hunter and Schmidt developed statistical aggregation techniques used in meta-analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Orlitzky et al. contributed to the meta-analysis findings regarding corporate social and financial performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>CSP and CFP are related as the study investigates the correlation between social and financial performance<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (CSP)<|>Meta-analysis is used to analyze the relationship between CSP and CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>Meta-analysis is used to analyze the relationship between CSP and CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMPLING ERROR<|>MEASUREMENT ERROR<|>Both sampling error and measurement error are artefacts that can affect the validity of meta-analytic findings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the meta-analytic findings<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
