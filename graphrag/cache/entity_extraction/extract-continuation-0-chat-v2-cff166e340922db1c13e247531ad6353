The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.\n\nAlthough this study is the first meta-analytical review for examining the impact of CG on CSD, the study faces limitations as well. It excludes the various corporate characteristics as determinants of CSD. Therefore, further study should investigate by considering all of the variables besides CG like firm size, leverage, profitability, firm age, industry type, etc. Regardless of these limitations, we predict that the empirical findings of this study will be beneficial for the future researcher to develop the theory on the link between CG and CSD.\n\n# References\n\nAbdullah, S.
