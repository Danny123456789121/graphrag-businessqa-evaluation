Employees of CSR firms benefit from practices such as fair pay, a safer work environment, and professional development opportunities (El Research has documented various ways in which CSR activities create value for Akremi, Gond, Swaen, De Roeck, & Igalens, 2018). In turn, they experience greater job satisfaction (De Roeck, El Akremi, & Swaen, 2016), exude higher levels of organizational commitment (Ali, Rehman, Ali, Yousaf, & Zia, 2010; Brammer, Millington, & Rayton, 2007), and engage more in organizational citizenship behaviors (Bode, Singh, & Rogan, 2015; Hansen, Dunford, Boss, Boss, & Angermeier, 2011). Firms profit from such motivated employees, not only because they are more productive, but also because firms can contract with them based on trust, which substantially decreases contracting costs (Jones, 1995).\n\nA firm’s suppliers of financial capital also reciprocate CSR activities. Research has found that high CSR firms tend to engage in elaborate voluntary reporting (Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang, & Yang, 2011), which reduces information asymmetry and agency costs (Cheng et al., 2014). As a result, debtholders, institutional investors, and other equity providers are willing to offer their resources to the firm at more favorable terms (Cheng et al., 2014; Dhaliwal et al., 2011; El Ghoul, Guedhami, Kwok, & Mishra, 2011).\n\nLocal communities and government bodies may similarly endorse the firm in CFP-enhancing ways (Frooman, 1999). Governments depend on a public mandate, which incentivizes them to scrutinize the firms in their jurisdictions for how they handle and affect community interests (Doh & Guay, 2006). Higher levels of community endorsement resulting from CSR may thus lead to more favorable regulatory and enforcement conditions for the firm (Campbell, 2007; Sharma & Henriques, 2005) and higher levels of public procurement (Flammer, 2018; den Hond, Rehbein, de Bakker, & Lankveld, 2014). Communities may also...\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

For example, firms in extraction industries often sign community benefit agreements, which are contracts between the firm and local communities stating how firms compensate communities for the social and environmental disruptions they will cause (Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017). In the absence of such initiatives, firms may face persistent stakeholder conflicts resulting in a depreciation of intangible assets and investor skepticism (Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017; Henisz et al., 2014). CSR may thus have beneficial effects on a firm’s existing stakeholder relationships, leading to stakeholder reciprocation and higher levels of CFP. Hence:\n\n# Hypothesis 2:\n\nThe CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by stakeholder reciprocation: CSR is positively related to stakeholder reciprocation, and stakeholder reciprocation is positively related to CFP.\n\n# The risk mitigation mechanism\n\nCSR firms are involved with a broader set of issues and engage with more diverse stakeholder groups than firms focusing strictly on their core business and operations (Hart & Sharma, 2004). With this broader perspective, firms can access new information that can be used to reduce firm-specific risk. Indeed, a prior meta-analysis has found a negative relationship between CSR and firm risk (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). More recent research supports this conclusion (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Lee & Faff, 2009; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009; Oikonomou, Brooks, & Pavelin, 2012), showing that stock price crash risk (Kim, Li, & Li, 2014) and firm default risk (Sun & Cui, 2014; Verwijmeren & Derwall, 2010) are both reduced by CSR activities.\n\nThere are two main explanations of how CSR can reduce risk. CSR may directly mitigate risk because many CSR activities are especially designed to avoid harm to\n\nstakeholders. Such activities are for instance, pollution prevention practices, employee health and safety programs, and fair-trade policies. Implementing these initiatives can reduce the firm’s risk exposure. ISO 14001 certification, for example, requires that firms have clear systems in place for monitoring and measuring environmental performance, creating awareness and competence among all employees, and organizing for emergency preparedness and response (Morrow & Rondinelli, 2002).\n\nCSR may also indirectly reduce firm risk. Through CSR, firms can develop closer relationships with their stakeholders, which makes them more willing to share information with these firms (Harrison, Bosse, & Phillips, 2010). CSR can thus prove instrumental for sensing changes or threats, as stakeholders may transmit early-warning signs to managers (Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Volkswagen’s emission-scandal, for example, was partly caused by its authoritative corporate culture, which made employees afraid of questioning targets or sharing bad news with their superiors (Cre\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSR FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSR firms are organizations that engage in Corporate Social Responsibility activities to benefit stakeholders and enhance their corporate financial performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL COMMUNITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Local communities are groups of people living in a specific area that may endorse CSR firms and influence their regulatory conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT BODIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government bodies are institutions that oversee and regulate firms, ensuring they adhere to community interests and CSR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEES<|>PERSON<|>Employees of CSR firms benefit from fair pay, safer work environments, and professional development opportunities, leading to greater job satisfaction and organizational commitment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBT HOLDERS<|>PERSON<|>Debt holders are financial stakeholders who provide capital to firms and may offer favorable terms to high CSR firms due to reduced information asymmetry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>PERSON<|>Institutional investors are organizations that invest large sums of money in firms and may prefer those with strong CSR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUITY PROVIDERS<|>PERSON<|>Equity providers are investors who supply capital to firms in exchange for ownership stakes and may favor firms with high CSR engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 14001<|>EVENT<|>ISO 14001 is a certification that requires firms to implement systems for monitoring environmental performance and ensuring stakeholder safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUNTARY REPORTING<|>EVENT<|>Voluntary reporting refers to the practice of CSR firms providing detailed information about their CSR activities to reduce information asymmetry.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR FIRMS<|>LOCAL COMMUNITIES<|>CSR firms engage with local communities to gain endorsement and support for their operations, which can lead to favorable regulatory conditions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR FIRMS<|>GOVERNMENT BODIES<|>CSR firms are scrutinized by government bodies for their CSR practices, which can influence regulatory and enforcement conditions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPLOYEES<|>CSR FIRMS<|>Employees benefit from CSR practices within CSR firms, leading to higher job satisfaction and commitment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEBT HOLDERS<|>CSR FIRMS<|>Debt holders are more likely to offer favorable terms to CSR firms due to reduced information asymmetry<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>CSR FIRMS<|>Institutional investors prefer investing in CSR firms because of their commitment to social responsibility and reduced risks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQUITY PROVIDERS<|>CSR FIRMS<|>Equity providers are more inclined to invest in CSR firms as they perceive them to have lower risks and better long-term prospects<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR FIRMS<|>ISO 14001<|>CSR firms may seek ISO 14001 certification to demonstrate their commitment to environmental performance and stakeholder safety<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR FIRMS<|>VOLUNTARY REPORTING<|>CSR firms engage in voluntary reporting to enhance transparency and reduce information asymmetry with stakeholders<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
