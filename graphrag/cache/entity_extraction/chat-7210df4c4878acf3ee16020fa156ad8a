Rolling Impact Estimates of the Temperature Shock Factor.\nThe impact is estimated for the entire sample using 30 years of preceding data for each estimate. Accordingly, the first period starts in 1983:4. We update the estimates each month by dropping the earliest observation and adding the latest observation. The mimicking factor (TSF) portfolio weights and the loadings on the mimicking factors are estimated using the 30 years of data preceding the data point. The value-weighted loadings are then multiplied by the TSF realization for the data point to obtain the impact estimate for that month.\n\nIn Panels A-D, PRIMARY represents our main specification given the basis asset and conditioning variable choices of Vassalou (2003) based on equation (4); ALT1 represents an alternative specification given the basis asset and conditioning variable choices of Kapadia (2011) based on equation (4a); ALT2 represents our alternative specification with the temperature growth rate as the temperature shock factor (equation (4b)); ALT3 directly uses the temperature surprise as the temperature shock factor (equation (4c)). Panel E shows the 30-year rolling average standard deviation of annual U.S. temperatures.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n195\n160\n1965\n1975\n1985\n140\n1945\n215\n# GLCBA\n\n# Figure 3. U.S. and global temperature anomalies\n\nFigure 3 plots the global and U.S. temperature anomalies. The source is the global temperature anomalies data from the National Climatic Data Center. The anomalies are defined as the temperature minus the average temperature over the 1951-1980 period, seasonally adjusted.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n34\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Table 1. Tracking Portfolios and Diagnostic Tests\n\nThe tracking portfolio regression results are in Panel A. All results are for the 1953:5 - 2014:5 period using overlapping data. While the dependent variable for PRIMARY and ALT1 is Tt+12 (the average annual temperature from t+1 to t+12), that for ALT2 is TGRTHt+12 (the temperature growth rate). SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, t, BH, LCMLG, and LGMRF are excess returns: the Fama-French size-value portfolios net of the one-month T-Bill rate, the corporate bond rate minus the long-term government bond rate, and the long-term government bond rate minus the T-Bill rate; RFt-1, DEFt-1-, and TERMt-1 represent, respectively, the lagged one-month T-Bill rate, the lagged default risk premium, and the lagged term premium. Panel B presents for each specification the average return on the zero-investment portfolio with the weights given by the coefficient estimates in Panel A. To adjust for the autocorrelation in errors resulting from the overlapping temperature shock data, Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation corrected standard errors are obtained employing a bandwidth of 24 months.\n\n# Panel A.
