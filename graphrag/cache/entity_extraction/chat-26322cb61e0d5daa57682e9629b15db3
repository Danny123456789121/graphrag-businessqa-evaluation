These variables are represented by a ranked nodes method that reduces the number of parameters needed for each variable and simplifies the definition of NPTs for decision-makers. Ranked nodes assume a truncated normal (TNormal) distribution with a central tendency towards the probability of parent nodes due to a weighted function [24]. In this study, a weighted average (wmean) function for the ranked nodes is used. This function requires a coefficient and a variance parameter for every parent variable. These parameters are defined using AHP results for sustainable dimension nodes. The DEMATEL results are used for the criteria nodes.\n\nBoolean variables have binary responses with true or false states. These variables are represented in the supplier selection node. For example, if (parents > 0.6, “True”, “False”), meaning “if the sum of the parent values is greater than 0.6 then the value is ‘True’; otherwise, it is ‘False’”.\n\nFive ordinal states (very low, low, medium, high and very high) are introduced for each criterion. These ranges are determined using feedback from three case company managers which are specific to their organization. The specific ranges for variable states for each criterion are summarized in Tables 7–9.\n\n# Table 7. Economic criteria states and ranges.\n\n|State|Eco1 (Cost)|Eco2 (Scrap Rate)|Eco3 (Delivery on Time)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Very low|&gt;200$|&gt;10%|97%|\n|Low|(150$, 200$)|(5%, 10%)|(97%, 98%)|\n|Medium|(100$, 150$)|(2%, 5%)|0.98%|\n|High|(50$, 100$)|(1%, 2%)|(98%, 99%)|\n|Very high|Price &lt; 50$|&lt;1%|&gt;99%|\n\n# Table 8.

For the “wmean” function, we need to define a coefficient for each variable and a variance parameter.\n\nFor example, in the broader sustainability dimensions level of BN, the parents of the node “economic dimension” (Eco) are (Eco1, Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values obtained by AHP as shown in Table 3.\n\nThe variance values for the ranked nodes were defined by the variance of the DEMATEL responses for the economic dimension (ECO). For example, when we asked the decision-makers (DM1), (DM2), (DM3) to answer the question “How much does cost (Eco1) influence the economic dimension (Eco)?”, they answered in different ways using the linguistic scale values (1 low, 2 medium, 3 high), respectively. Then, we calculate the variance of these answers by taking the difference between the largest and smallest valued responses, as shown in Table 10.\n\n**Table 10. Means and variances of effects of Eco1, Eco2 and Eco3 on Eco.**\n|Parameters|How Much Does Cost (Eco1) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|How Much Does Quality of Product (Eco2) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|How Much Does Quality of Service (Eco) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Mean|0.350|0.067|0.199|\n|Variance|0.01|0.01|0.01|\n\nAt the criteria level, the weights of each parent were defined based on their coefficients in the average direct relation matrix obtained from DEMATEL. For example, the parents of cost (Eco1) are (Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
