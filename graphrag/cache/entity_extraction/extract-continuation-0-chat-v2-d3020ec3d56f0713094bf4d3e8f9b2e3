This study further proposes an integrative conceptual framework of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms affects a wide range of HT stakeholders that may result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value through resource-based, ethical, financial, legal, educational, cultural, and technological mechanisms. By integrating the perspectives of more than 30 hospitality and tourism academics and practitioners on the conceptualization of this subject, the current study offers insight and foresight and may serve as a catalyst for further impactful research.\n\n# Introduction\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a form of artificial intelligence that can create various forms of original content. In contrast to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which can independently learn and execute a wide range of tasks and ideas (and is presently only hypothetical), GAI is referred to as “generative” because it can generate specific kinds of output, such as text, audio, images, and video, based on supervised or unsupervised training (Stening, 2023). Popular GAI tools include platforms such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Bard, DALL-E 2, and many others.\n\nThe potential impact of this technology on society and humanity is profound; and like all industries, the hospitality and tourism (HT) industry is poised for a wide range of exciting new advancements and unprecedented challenges as GAI continues to develop (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023a, 2023b; Mich & Garigliano, 2023). For example, when applied to marketing functions in the HT industry, GAI can use travel history, consumption preferences, and social media content to create personalized recommendations for travelers, generate descriptions of destinations and hotel properties, and even create virtual tours of hotels and attractions (Lalli, 2023), simultaneously creating value for firms and consumers. Likewise, on the financial side, GAI-enabled technologies can generate novel insights into portfolio optimization strategies, capital structure, key performance indicators, and fund allocations (Kizildag et al., 2019; Ozdemir et al., 2023), simultaneously creating value for firms and for society. Indeed, for nearly all functional areas of HT firms, there are potential applications of GAI that can be used to increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, enhance workplace productivity, and enrich the customer experience.\n\nDespite the excitement over the potential benefits of GAI, however, the adoption of such technologies comes with a set of ethical, social, and economic considerations. In many cases, the use of GAI is seen as a double-edged sword, where the solution to old problems can become the source of new ones (Zhuo et al., 2023). Many such problems have already arrived in the form of privacy and security concerns, intellectual property rights violations, and liability and accountability issues, to name only a few. In acknowledgment of both the promises and the challenges of GAI, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we seek to provide a critical examination of the effects of GAI applications across a broad spectrum of industrial and social stakeholders in HT. Second, we propose an integrative conceptual framework of GAI adoption in the HT industry that can be used in pursuit of meaningful future research in the field. Through the contribution of a wide range of academic and practical perspectives, this paper highlights the potential advantages and disadvantages of GAI and considers how GAI researchers can navigate the complexities of this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nIn taking such an approach, this paper develops a conceptual framework for the future exploration of GAI in hospitality and tourism research. As such, the purpose of this research is not to present a detailed account of the current state of GAI in the HT industry. Rather, the goal is to propose a framework that can be used to ensure that future GAI-based research is maximally relevant to practical hospitality and tourism management. In so doing, the study addresses Mondal and colleagues’ (2023) call for comprehensive models and frameworks to analyze the application of GAI in different sectors. Specifically, this paper takes a stakeholder theory perspective of the GAI phenomenon, providing an account of the potential benefits and challenges of GAI for HT firms in relation to customers, employees, suppliers, and many other stakeholders in the HT landscape. The end result is a list of 50 research questions that can be used to drive forward the exciting new era of GAI-based research in the HT industry.\n\n# Methodology\n\nGiven that the goal of this research is the creation of a framework to drive the future of an emerging research phenomenon (i.e., GAI in the HT industry), an inductive methodological approach was taken. Specifically, 30 hospitality and tourism practitioners with a wide range of research and industrial expertise were selected to participate in this research. Rather than enlisting these experts as data points, all contributors were asked to take authorship of the paper. In accordance with the tenets of theoretical sampling, the contributors to (and thus, authors of) this research were carefully chosen to represent a broad range of hospitality and tourism expertise, including law, finance, marketing, operations, finance, accounting, strategic management, human resources, design, sustainability, restaurants, hotels, destinations, and travel.\n\n# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\n\ndesigned to be collectively exhaustive or mutually exclusive, analysis of the content provided across the contributing authors indicated that most of the major functional areas of HT industries were represented.\n\nThe 30 hospitality and tourism experts were identified through the process of theoretical sampling and then contacted via e-mail to solicit their participation in the project. All 30 people who were contacted agreed to contribute. In order to ensure a common frame of reference across contributors, the e-mail\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>EVENT<|>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a form of artificial intelligence that creates original content across various media, impacting the hospitality and tourism industry significantly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The hospitality and tourism (HT) industry encompasses businesses and services related to travel, accommodation, and entertainment, which are influenced by advancements in technology like GAI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARVALHO & IVANOV<|>PERSON<|>Carvalho & Ivanov are researchers who have contributed insights on the impact of GAI in the hospitality and tourism sector.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DWIVEDI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Dwivedi et al. are researchers who have explored the implications of GAI in various contexts, including hospitality and tourism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LALLI<|>PERSON<|>Lalli is a researcher who has discussed the applications of GAI in marketing functions within the hospitality and tourism industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIZILDAG ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Kizildag et al. are researchers who have examined GAI's role in financial strategies within the hospitality and tourism sector.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OZDEMIR ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Ozdemir et al. are researchers who have analyzed GAI's impact on financial performance in the hospitality and tourism industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONDAL ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Mondal et al. have called for comprehensive models to analyze GAI applications in various sectors, including hospitality and tourism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>30 HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM EXPERTS<|>PERSON<|>A group of 30 experts from various fields within hospitality and tourism who contributed to the research on GAI.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>GAI significantly impacts the hospitality and tourism industry by enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARVALHO & IVANOV<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>Carvalho & Ivanov have provided insights on the effects of GAI in the hospitality and tourism sector<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DWIVEDI ET AL.<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>Dwivedi et al. have explored the implications of GAI in the hospitality and tourism industry<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LALLI<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>Lalli has discussed GAI's applications in marketing within the hospitality and tourism sector<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIZILDAG ET AL.<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>Kizildag et al. have examined GAI's role in financial strategies in the hospitality and tourism industry<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OZDEMIR ET AL.<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>Ozdemir et al. have analyzed GAI's impact on financial performance in the hospitality and tourism sector<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONDAL ET AL.<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>Mondal et al. have called for models to analyze GAI applications in hospitality and tourism<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>30 HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM EXPERTS<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>The 30 experts contributed to the research on GAI in the hospitality and tourism industry<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
