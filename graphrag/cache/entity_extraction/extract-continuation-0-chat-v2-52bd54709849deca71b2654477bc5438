The pandemic caused by the coronavirus emphasized vulnerabilities related to the overreliance of JIT and lean delivery systems. Additionally, there is a concern about whether JIT systems can contribute to the overall efficiency of resources and waste, in order to transform them into environmentally sound [85].\n\nThe growing smarter logistics systems are witnessed by organizations, specifically the consideration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies applications, and reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products. Some possible applications of IoT and reverse logistics are addressed. In the first example, monitoring where electronics and appliances and their components are may ease their retrieval and allocation at local levels. As a second example, companies may benefit by using intermediary storage/depots instead of using extensive transportation of processed goods, also favoring reverse logistics.
