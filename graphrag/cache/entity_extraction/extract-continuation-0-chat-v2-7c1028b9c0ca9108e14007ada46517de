All 30 people who were contacted agreed to contribute. In order to ensure a common frame of reference across contributors, the e-mail contained a set of instructions for how to contribute. Specifically, each contributor was asked to write up to 500 words on the implications of GAI in the field of hospitality and tourism management. As per JHTR’s guidelines, contributors were asked to focus on “big ideas” that “generate transcendent insight that inspires, provokes, excites, and engages our audiences.” Additionally, contributors were expressly asked to provide an account of the transformative effects of GAI on HT industry stakeholders, focusing on what is already happening as well as what could potentially happen in the future. After providing this discussion, contributors were asked to provide an additional 100 to 200 words that would indicate the most imperative research questions pertaining to their writings.\n\nEach contributor was given 2 weeks to make their submission, with a reminder e-mail sent at the 1-week mark. The reminder e-mail reiterated the instructions regarding big ideas, stakeholder emphasis, and so forth. Once all writings were received, the analysis was conducted in two parts: (1) model development and writing integration and (2) development of research questions and ranking.\n\nTo develop the model, four of the authors acted as an editorial team to review, sort, aggregate, and interpret the submissions of the other authors. Through the process of thematic analysis and emergent design, an integrative framework (referred to as the REFLECT model) was developed. The primary themes inherent to the model included the functional areas of HT firms/industry domains in which GAI is adopted/implemented; the stakeholders in the HT landscape affected by GAI adoption; and the mechanisms through which these effects are calibrated (i.e., REFLECT factors). Consistent with the value creation perspective of stakeholder theory, the final emergent theme was the dual processes of co-creation and co-destruction of value that are manifested in a reciprocal nature via the other three components of the model. The writings of all the authors were then organized around the four emergent themes. Specifically, the editorial team collaborated via video conferencing to organize and edit all the written submissions of the other authors. In this way, this research and the end results (i.e., the sections of the manuscript that follow) is not a set of standalone contributions; rather, this manuscript represents the integration of a large and diverse group of experts, presented in a unified model and driven by an inductively-derived theoretical framework.\n\nFinally, the research directives and/or questions submitted by each author were reviewed. As before, the four editorial authors worked together to combine these contributions into a list of 50 specific questions across four different categories: general directives, GAI application questions, REFLECT-based questions, and stakeholder-based questions. A survey was then designed to allow each contributing author to rate each question on a 5-point importance scale ranging from “not at all important” to “extremely important.” This survey was then sent to all authors to complete. The results of this survey are presented in tabular form in the concluding section of the manuscript and highlight key areas of future inquiry into the GAI phenomenon.\n\n# Emergent Framework of GAI in the HT Industry: The REFLECT Model\n\nThe themes and processes emerging from the methodological approach outlined above are proposed in a framework referred to hereafter as the REFLECT model of value co-creation and value-co-destruction (see Figure 1). This model provides an account of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms (e.g., operations, management, marketing, etc.) can affect a wide range of social and industrial stakeholders. In the model, the HT firm is the principal agent of value creation in the hospitality ecosystem. The impact of firm-enabled GAI applications on various stakeholders is mediated by a variety of factors (the REFLECT mechanisms) that must be optimally calibrated to ensure that the firm maximizes the value created across the system, for as many stakeholders as possible.\n\nWhile the HT firm has agency for creating and capturing value in a GAI-enabled hospitality ecosystem, the REFLECT model is predicated on two important considerations. First, in line with the service-dominant logic (SDL) of the firm, the value dynamics identified in the model are non-recursive in nature. GAI applications are fundamentally based on stakeholder interaction and engagement; thus, stakeholders are not passive recipients of a firm’s value proposition, but instead “co-create” (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004) and/or “co-destroy” (Ple & Caceres, 2010) value in the system. This latter possibility that GAI implementation can have adverse consequences leading to value co-destruction has been identified in extant research (e.g., Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Houde et al., 2020). For example, value is co-destroyed by a firm’s employees if they sabotage GAI applications that they perceive to be a threat to their jobs, because management did not enable an organizational culture conducive to GAI implementation and/or did not educate employees on the implications of GAI for their work.\n\nSecond, the value co-creation and co-destruction feedback loops indicate that the benefits of using GAI to facilitate mutually beneficial firm-stakeholder relationships (i.e., value co-creation) may, in turn, create friction in other stakeholder relationships (i.e., value co-destruction).
