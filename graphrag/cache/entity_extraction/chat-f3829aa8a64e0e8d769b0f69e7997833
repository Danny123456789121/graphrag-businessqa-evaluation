Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists’ motivations for achieving their objectives.\n\n# Research Findings/Insights\n\nBased on a sample of U.S. S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially-motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially-motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations.\n\n# Theoretical/Academic Implications\n\nOur findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists’ underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations.\n\n# Practitioner/Policy Implications\n\nOur findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the U.S.\n\n# Keywords\n\nCorporate Governance, Shareholder Activism, Gender Diversity, Board Composition\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

These questions are motivated by recent initiatives by numerous international legislative, regulatory, and advocacy organizations directed toward addressing female underrepresentation on corporate boards. Norway was the first country to introduce a quota of 40 percent for its corporate boards, and as of 2013 at least ten countries have established legal quotas requiring a minimum percentage of women directors on corporate boards, ranging from 30 percent (in Germany)1 to 50 percent (in Israel)2. The European Union (EU), Brazil, Canada (Quebec), India, and the Philippines have similar legislation proposed or pending3. In addition, regulatory bodies in at least 20 countries have instituted “comply-or-explain” rules to encourage greater gender diversity on corporate boards. For example, firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) are required to establish measurable objectives for achieving BOD gender diversity and annually assess their progress in achieving them or explain why they have not done so, and in the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to disclose whether and how its nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for directors. Advocacy organizations, such as Catalyst and 2020 Women on Boards, have also pressed for voluntary improvements in board diversity.\n\nConcurrent with the above broad-based approaches, there has also been an increase in shareholder activism devoted to greater board diversity in recent years, particularly in the U.S., where shareholders have initiated more than 250 proposals targeting individual firms to increase female representation on corporate boards since 1997 – over 30 proposals were filed in 2013 alone. In addition, diversity resolutions filed in the U.S. in 2013 received the highest average vote (35.8 percent) among environmental and social governance categories, with\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Due to their non-binding nature, shareholder proposals in the U.S. have historically been viewed as a weak mechanism to drive governance reform (Bebchuk, 2005), and while firms have been more responsive to shareholder proposals in recent years, Thomas and Cotter (2007) document that even in cases where the proposal receives a majority vote by shareholders, only 25 percent of proposals in their sample are implemented by the board. In addition, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
