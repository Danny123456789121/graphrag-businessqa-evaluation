The strategies with an external focus (extroverted and visionary sustainability strategy) are likely to have a particularly strong societal impact. By achieving improvements in terms of the sustainability issues described above, both internal and external stakeholders (employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, neighbors and society itself) are likely to benefit.\n\n# ACCEPTED\n\n9\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Table 3: Social issues of business activities (based on Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; ISO, 2010)\n\nInternal social issues• workplace health and safety, avoidance of workplace accidents• corporate governance• participation of employees in decision making• diversity and equality• employee orientation and employee development, attractiveness of the company to employees• respect for human rights in the company• protection of customer data• ethical behavior of the company (avoidance of corruption, cartelization)• company´s contribution to societal development on a regional, national, or international level (e.g., job offers)External social issues• respect for human rights in the company´s sphere of influence (e.g., with respect to child labor, rights of indigenous people, a right to labor unions and collective agreements)• reporting on social aspects of the business activities• product descriptions and consumer information\nAn important task for management is now to identify the economic, environmental and social issues that are important to the company. This may be done by applying the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) with its five-level model sustainability principles, ABCD-planning procedure and funnel-metaphor (Broman and Robèrt, 2015). The FSSD is recommended because it provides robust, comprehensive and generic principles for sustainability, as well as a logical process for integrating these principles into strategic planning. The funnel-metaphor is included in the FSSD to indicate how a current (non-sustainable) business practice will reduce the decision-making autonomy of companies in the mid- to long-term, since they are confronted with, for example, continually increasing social pressures and resource costs. This will lead to increased financial risks, and these are likely to be lower for more sustainable companies. By using the ABCD-planning process, a company can identify its options to comply with the FSSD sustainability principles and reduce the risk of sudden costs that jeopardize opportunities and are difficult to predict, as well as stay informed about cutting edge sustainability-driven business developments (Ny et al., 2006).\n\nNot all businesses have a positive social value, however, and whether a company delivers a positive societal value or not is based on societal perceptions about the company’s products and services, as well as its physical impact on the natural environment. There is, for instance, a considerable consensus that producing nuclear weapons does not generate positive societal values. In the case of conventional weapon systems, however, arguments concerning their relative social value are more mixed. Whether cars or coffee pods have a positive societal value is also debated.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nvalue is even more controversial. While both products have positive impacts on individual users, they also have clear systemic disadvantages. However, identifying the societal value of business activities from a sustainability perspective requires the application of robust sustainability principles as defined by the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015).\n\nBelow, four propositions are made, indicating how corporate sustainability management may enhance societal value.\n\n# Proposition 1a:\n\nIntegrating environmental and social issues into the content dimension of strategic management is a prerequisite to creating societal value.\n\n# Example 1a:\n\nConsidering environmental (such as CO2 emissions in production processes or the product portfolio) and social issues (such as working conditions throughout the supply chain) in strategic decisions to reduce negative impacts is beneficial for society and the biosphere.\n\nThe measurement of whether a company creates societal values from a sustainability perspective requires a benchmark or reference point. With regard to economic criteria, indicators such as tax payments, investment in local communities, or R&D expenditures are commonly used. With regard to environmental and social sustainability criteria, the Brundtland definition of sustainable development must be operationalized. Environmental and social problems may arise, for instance, from damage caused by emissions or poor working conditions. For example, Labuschagne et al. (2005), Krajnc and Glavic (2005) or Cunha Callado and Fensterseifer (2011) provided frameworks that could be used to measure corporate economic, environmental and social impacts. However, defining all kinds of environmental and social impacts is highly challenging, not only because different spatial conditions that change over time apply, but also because of the interdependencies between different issues and their impacts. Nevertheless, by focusing on the major factors involved, relatively robust sustainability principles can still be defined (Robèrt, 2000). Using the principles as defined in the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015) provides a solid, stable and comprehensive basis for assessing whether corporations create societal values or not. Additionally, these sustainability principles can be used as guides to define sustainability criteria (Hallstedt, 2015).\n\n# Proposition 1b:\n\nIn order to measure the societal value of corporate sustainability management, the operationalization of sustainable development needs to be testable. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers this kind of operationalization.\n\n11\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Example 1b: Companies that are aware of their sustainability activities\n\nmeasure them by using criteria and key performance indicators linked to the FSSD principles.\n\nThe sustainability performance of a company is based\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
