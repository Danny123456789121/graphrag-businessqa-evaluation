Building on our objectives for this study, our primary research questions include, but are not limited, to what are the most influenceable metrics for corporate sustainability? And how can they be evaluated and ranked in a way that provide value to practitioners and scholars? After reviewing the literature, conceptual models, our research framework, and applying a Fuzzy Delphi method, we assess nine sustainability criteria and forty-five sub-criteria. We review our methods for employing the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) for calculations of weights for both the sub-criteria using a matrix of pairwise comparisons. Results are then discussed, and the last section provides main conclusions, contributions to the field, and avenues for aspects of corporate sustainability, social sustainability, and sustainable development for future researches.\n\n# 2. Literature Review\n\nThe definitions of sustainability have many interpretations, such as environmental protection, ecosystem resources, economic concerns, social acceptance, licensing and externalities, and many other perspectives. The recent literature shows that sustainable development is going beyond “green” to a more comprehensive, systematic, methodological, and integrated understanding of sustainability. Researchers and decision-makers are aware of the need for systematic sustainability assessments to evaluate complex systems to replace traditional and unsustainable business practices. Such assessments ultimately concentrate on historical strategies for sustainability, demonstrating the need to improve corporate sustainability programs over time, along with allocating resources that reduce sustainability risks. Further, organizations need to combine efficiency and market performance initiatives to develop strategic corporate sustainability opportunities [23].\n\nAsif et al. [24], conceptualized the integration of economic, social, and environmental bottom lines dimension by using a triple bottom line. This view of a corporation means that the efficiency and sustainability aspects of the integrated structure are matched together. Several models have been proposed to develop corporate sustainability in efforts to make it accessible, practical, and quantifiable. The wide range of sustainability frameworks is because of the variety of definitions of sustainable development, i.e. ecological sustainability, environmental efficiency, corporate citizenship, and TBL. In prior studies, one dimension of corporate sustainability is evaluated to define, measure, and sometimes test constructs and relationships. For instance, environmental sustainability frameworks concentrate on environmental issues by providing metrics for mitigating pollution, climate vulnerability, environmental degradation, land use, and loss of biodiversity [25].\n\nSocial sustainability models focus on societal and ethical facets of corporate sustainability, such as infrastructure, community welfare, human rights, health, equity, and education [26]. Further, economic sustainability involves the economic structure of organizations and concentrates on businesses seeking to optimize the company’s resources through social and environmental strategies [27]. Some studies proposed the two-dimensional sustainability frameworks in which two or more dimensions of corporate sustainability (such as environmental and social dimensions evaluated by providing sustainability indices and MCDA approaches). The fundamental model of corporate sustainability is shown in Figure 1.\n\n|CONTEXT|Economic|Environment|Social|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|CHANGE|Systematic|Organizational|Individual|\n\nFigure 1. Conventional Corporate Sustainability Model.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nConcerns regarding the social and environmental effects of sustainability must be weighted, but economic viability should not be threatened. The company’s financial performance can be affected and impacts its risk of survival if it fails to give due attention to its economic performance [28]. Longoni and Cagliano [29] argued that managing and balancing TBL performance is paramount. The authors acknowledge the difficulties of doing this while also trying to understand any negative tradeoffs between the three sustainability dimensions.\n\nThe International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) systems assist companies in integrating sustainable development and TBL performance. GRI measures and reports the “material” performance of companies and its business activities and its effectiveness in multiple dimensions, i.e., three folds result to the public, most of the time through sustainability reports [30]. Several sustainability indices have been developed to highlight sustainability activities so that investors can consider the sustainable performance of enterprises. By analyzing the sustainability practices by each corporation, the sustainability indices act as a knowledge intermediary of companies with their different players (including business specialists, shareholders, and financial intermediaries). Specialized data accessed by neutral parties are seen by these intermediaries as objective. Conventional definitions of sustainability suggest that the businesses are supposed to be listed only if they are more socially and environmentally responsible than their competitors within these stock indexes. Sustainability stock indexes can, therefore, be treated as suitable sustainability performance indicators. Weber [31] suggests sustainability guidance that describes the most relevant performance metrics and issues in six banking industries. They showed specific important issues are shared by many industries, particularly social sustainability aspects, whereas others are unique in a sector.\n\nSeveral researchers have used MCDA methods to measure the company’s sustainability performance. A list of different MCDA approaches used to develop a sustainability framework is shown in Table 1.\n\n**Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Methods in Corporate Sustainability**\n|N.|Sustainability Research Conducted|MCDA Method|Year|Reference|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|01|The assessment and weigh of the CSR program criteria in industry; and supplier assessment|AHP|2018|[32,33]|\n|02|A geographic information system sustainability model based on GeoUmbriaSUIT|TOPSIS|2018|[34]|\n|03|Identifying the CSR criteria as well as propose and priorities the alternatives to improve the supply chain performance.|AHP-TOPSIS|2018|[35]|\n|04|Selection of sustainable green Supplier under Uncertain Environment: Evidence from Thailand Palm oil products Industry|Fuzzy DEMATEL|2019|[36]|\n|05|Prioritizing and selection of a socially sustainable supplier for social sustainability|TODIM|2019|[37]|\n|06|Framework of sustainability balanced score\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
