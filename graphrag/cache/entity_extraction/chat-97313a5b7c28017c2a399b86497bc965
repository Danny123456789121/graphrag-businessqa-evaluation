We allow those board characteristics, which displayed significant mean correlations in the meta-analytic correlation matrix (Table 2), to covary with each other. As reported in Table 3, the model fits the data in an acceptable manner (comparative fit index [CFI] = .958, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .056, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .022) and all paths are significant, except the path linking CEO–chair duality to CSR directly and the path linking CEO–chair duality to the presence of a CSR committee.\n\nThe indirect effects on CSR that are channeled through the presence of a CSR committee are significant for board size (β = .023; p < .001), board independence (β = .014; p < .001), and female board representation (β = .030; p < .001). Thus, H5 is supported suggesting a partial mediation of the presence of a CSR committee, except for CEO–chair duality, which is neither directly (β = .002; p = .708) nor indirectly related to CSR (β = .001; p = .242) and is also not significantly related to the presence of a CSR committee (β = .007; p = .241).\n\n# Business & Society 00(0)\n\n# Table 2.

Table 4 reports the results. Regarding H6, concerning the influence of countries’ shareholder protection strength, we find significantly negative effects regarding the relationships between board size (β = −.489; p < .001) and CSR and board independence and CSR (β = −.466; p < .001) (i.e., the positive relationships are significantly weaker in countries with stronger levels of shareholder protection).\n\nIn H7, we hypothesized that countries’ level of gender parity moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR. Our results...\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\n# Figure 1. Results of meta-analytic path modeling.\n\nshow a significantly positive effect (β = .542; p < .001), providing evidence that the relationship between female board representation and CSR is more positive for firms in countries with greater gender parity. This result is in line with the finding of Byron and Post (2016).\n\nOur hypothesis H8 was about possible differences in the relationships depending on whether the environmental or the social dimension of CSR is examined. To test this hypothesis, we included dummy variables in the regression models taking the value of 1 when the measurement of CSR in the study focused on the environmental dimension of CSR (or social dimension respectively) and 0 in the case of aggregate CSR measures. We find that an exclusive focus on the environmental dimension significantly weakens the relationship between board size and CSR (β = −.359; p = .002) and the relationship between female board representation and CSR (β = −.301; p = .054). We also find that an exclusive focus on the social dimension significantly strengthens the relationship between board independence and CSR (β = .208; p = .073), and the relationship between female board representation and CSR (β = .347; p = .013), but weakens the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR (β = −.253; p = .051). However, given that we found that the CEO–chair duality—CSR relationship is not significant, this finding should be interpreted with caution.\n\n# Table 3.
