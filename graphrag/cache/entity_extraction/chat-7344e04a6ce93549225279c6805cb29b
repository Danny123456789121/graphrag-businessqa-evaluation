Its global economic performance (Eco) is predicted to be 50.31%, a medium level, which should be improved as this criterion is the most important for DMs in this case. The final decision about selecting supplier S2 is 58.2% true and 41.7% false. Therefore, supplier S2 should improve some areas of performance in order to satisfy the requirement level as a sustainable supplier. The result reinforces the decision-maker’s opinion about supplier S2. The company knew that S2 was not performing exceptionally well but did not know at which level and where S2 could improve. This model was useful in identifying some means of improving S2’s performance, allowing the company to strengthen collaboration by aiding in supplier development.\n\nUsing the incomplete information that decision-makers have about supplier S3, its environmental and social performance is likely to be high with probability (68.69%, 75.22%), respectively. Moreover, despite the high uncertainty due to the lack of information regarding the environmental criteria (Env1) and (Env2), social criteria (Soc1) and (Soc2), selecting S3 is approximately 76.4% true. This result is due to the high-level probability forecast of 58.91% in its global economic performance. The decision-makers believe that they can establish a partnership with this company.\n\nMathematically complex approaches are often not easily understood and useable by decision-makers. Here, the methodology feedback from the managerial decision-makers was very positive. They find the model easy to use and helpful in evaluating suppliers. Causal expert-driven BNs are usually complex. By combining AHP, DEMATEL and BNs, we simplify the building of the model while developing some methodological consistency. Using different types of events including Boolean and qualitative make the model flexible. Further, different sources of data ranging from historical to actual evidence were valuable as well and could be effectively integrated overall into the BN model. Furthering transparency and replicability in a clear rigorous process builds the legitimacy of the model. The graphical nature of the BN results makes the technique more accessible to management, furthering managerial acceptance. The clarity and legitimacy are important when seeking the adoption of decision tools and models in organizations.\n\nThe proposed model is based on theoretical aspects and dimensions supported by organizational needs and requirements. Additionally, the results could have been varied in as required by the organizational decision-makers to further validate their specific “what-if” scenarios. The approach\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n# 5. Conclusions\n\n# 5.1. Summary of Findings and Contributions\n\nEvaluating and selecting suppliers according to the triple bottom line (TBL) approach can reinforce sustainable performance in supply networks. In practical situations, this task is a complicated multi-criteria decision-making problem and time-consuming assignment. This decision is generally imprecise and uncertain, with limited and unknown information. This study provides a global picture for sustainable supplier selection problems and proposes a decision-making tool using a combined, harmonized, AHP-DEMATEL-BN method. The decision environment provided some uncertainty for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers. The proposed approach could easily convert decision-maker knowledge and preferences into meaningful results. An actual case example for the sustainable supplier selection problem in a manufacturing company provided some managerial and research insights.\n\nThis research contributes to the field of sustainable supplier selection by incorporating judgment with actual data. Historical and unknown information were also integrated into the evaluation. These are real situations, which no one model can capture.\n\nBased on AHP, DMs were able to evaluate sustainable criteria and to understand their current priorities in the supplier evaluation process. Using DEMATEL, the interactions among evaluation criteria with selection purposes were also clearly identified. The BN model allowed decision-makers to incorporate incomplete information and missing data. Thus, despite the high uncertainty due to the lack of information concerning the evaluation of certain suppliers, DMs were able to evaluate them in a clear, rigorous process.\n\nThus, the obtained results offer guidelines for analysts and decision-makers in order to understand the current issues related to the sustainable supplier selection process. These results can also help decision-makers to control evaluation criteria and to improve the relationships with their selected suppliers. This research demonstrated some of the advantages and disadvantages of each method. It was shown that AHP, DEMATEL and BN were good, complementary approaches.\n\n# 5.2. Limitations\n\nHowever, the approach has some limitations. We only focused on a small set of potential criteria for supplier evaluation and selection. In some cases, dozens of factors can be considered. In this situation, the decision environment becomes more complex. For instance, using AHP with more than nine evaluation criteria at the same level of hierarchy requires grouping some of them into an overall criterion and creating sub-criteria. Some filtering to key performance indicators (KPI) may be required for the methodology to remain tractable. As we have mentioned, one of the important characteristics of any model, its usefulness and acceptance, is dependent on how well managers understand the whole process. In this case, although some of the AHP analysis may be intuitive, the BN required greater explanation. Moreover, the use of the hydride approach based on AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods seems quite complicated for decision-makers in companies while selecting the supplier. Alternatively, the rigor provides an avenue for analysts to convince managers of the scientific propensity of the technique, further justifying decisions.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n# 5.3.
