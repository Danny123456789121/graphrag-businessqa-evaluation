The development of GAI today is marked by further advancements in algorithms and techniques that enable a generation of new and original content. Although these recent advancements are still far away from artificial general intelligence in which systems are capable of human-like behavior in all aspects, encompassing cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence, businesses in all industries should not neglect these developments. It is widely argued that we are entering a new era that will revolutionize how we obtain information, generate content, cater to consumer demands, and operate businesses (Daugherty et al. 2023).\n\n# 4. Methodology and data\n\n# 4.1 Approach\n\nTo gain an overview of the actual landscape in the field of GAI, we conducted a scoping review and categorized the publications and sources with a qualitative content analysis. The primary aim of this paper is to provide an initial understanding of the potential implications of GAI for BMI. Due to the novelty and rapid development of this technology, we employed a systematic scoping review method, incorporating scientific as well as non-scientific sources, to ensure the inclusion of developments on the forefront of the scientific as well as public discourse. More specifically, we followed a PRISMA-ScR, which ensures consistent reporting items by identifying, pre-selecting, checking the suitability, and finally deciding to include or exclude a source, as proposed by Tricco et al. (2018). In line with Kraus et al. (2022a) and Sauer and Seuring (2023), we conducted a systematic sampling technique involving a structured process for data collection to enhance our study’s reproducibility and transparency. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we additionally enriched the scientific sources with non-academic sources, including articles, books, pre-prints, press statements, and company websites, in addition to publicly available information such as podcasts, interviews, or event recordings capturing industry leaders’ opinions, as also applied by other scoping reviews analyzing recent emerging phenomena (e.g., Cheong et al. 2022; Murphy et al. 2021; Syrowatka et al. 2021). For the content analysis of the identified sources, we\n\n# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\n\n# 4.2 Sample selection\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive search of databases, including EBSCO, Science-Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The data collection processes were conducted from March 15th to April 30th, 2023. The initial approach of the search scope resulted in targeting publications with the terms “business model (innovation)” and “generative AI” within either title or abstract. However, we realized that the combination of those terms is not sufficient for the analysis, and so we chose a broader approach, enhanced with manual selection and the precise narrowing down of the research funnel. Therefore, we opted for a dual search strain approach, completed by the inclusion of non-academic sources (see Fig. 2 for details).\n\nIn the first strain, we searched for “generative AI” terms (including spelling variations such as “Generative AI”, “Generative Artificial Intelligence”, “GAI”, “GenAI”) which resulted in 2845 hits in EBSCO. Narrowing this down further based on the exclusion of publications older than 2022 and additionally filtering for peer-reviewed publications resulted in 234 hits. The same search yielded 145 results from Web of Science, resulting in 26 narrowed down results. In ScienceDirect, this resulted in an initial 4748; again, this was considerably narrowed down to 76 results. Last, the same search conducted in Google Scholar resulted in 3407 hits, reduced by the filter criteria to 166. The total of 502 publications was then reduced by excluding duplications and manually removing publications that (a) did not match the topic; (b) were solely IT-focused (e.g., explaining the training of the datasets); and (c) that were not in English (if not already filtered automatically beforehand). This led to 143 publications.\n\nThe second search strain was conducted with specific companies and concrete applications, including “OpenAI,” “ChatGPT” (and its variations), “DALL-E,” “Midjourney,” “Jasper,” “StableAI,” and “Google Bard”. These specific GAI applications and companies were selected following Forbes’ AI 50 list by selecting companies which were additionally listed in the Market Insights report of Statista (Cai 2023; Senn-Kalb and Metha 2023), to ensure the inclusion listing of relevant applications and companies on the forefront of the public as well as scientific.\n\n# D. K. Kanbach et al.\n\n# Fig. 1\n\nPRISMA-ScR for this paper’s publication selection (own illustration following Tricco et al. (2018))\n\nFurthermore, we cross-referenced the actuality and importance by studying Google Trends in AI from September 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023 and hereby added more relevant companies, e.g., DALL-E. Given the rapid development of the technology, it is not possible to include all tools, services, and even companies who have launched GAI applications, but at the time of research we covered the most intensely discussed ones following (non-) scientific literature and AI trends in search engines by excluding the ones that do not concentrate on creating content (like text, audio, or video). This resulted in 40,045 hits in EBSCO; filtering for results only in 2022–2023, peer-reviewed, only including English results, and removing false hits.\n\n# The GenAI is out of the bottle: gener\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
