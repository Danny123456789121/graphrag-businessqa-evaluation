Thus, proactive approaches may involve better “housekeeping”, material substitution, process innovation, redesign of production and service delivery processes, creative problem solving, the adoption of innovative technologies, or collaboration with stakeholders (Hart 1995; Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Firms that utilize proactive strategies view environmental management as important for business, encourage employee involvement, and receive significant support from top management (Henriques and Sadorsky 1999). Beyond the benefits to the natural environment, proactive environmental strategies may also benefit the firm through decreased costs for raw materials due to better utilization of inputs, simplification and removal of unnecessary steps in production leading to decreased cycle times (Hart 1995) and the development of valuable organization capabilities such as stakeholder integration, higher-order learning, and continuous innovation (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). It is also possible, and likely, that some firms also pursue proactive and reactive strategies simultaneously.\n\nMost researchers would conclude that proactive strategies should lead to greater reduction of environmental impact than reactive approaches. However, the question of\n\nThe interest for this study involves the influence of proactive versus reactive environmental strategies on CFP. Thus, the question can be stated, “does the additional investment in proactive environmental practices (e.g., process innovation) positively influence the financial bottom line to a greater extent than reliance on traditional, reactive, end-of-pipe solutions or when both strategies coexist?” In other words, “when does it pay to be green?” Through meta-analytical techniques, we compare the results of studies using reactive environmental strategy measures (e.g., pollution control) to studies using proactive environmental strategy measures (e.g., process redesign), as well as studies using measures reflecting both, in regards to their influence on CFP.\n\n# Firm Characteristics\n\n# Large Versus Small Firms\n\nA significant number of management studies use samples consisting of large firms, often from the Fortune 500, which may limit the generalizability of findings. Researchers have pointed out strategic differences between large and small firms raising the question of whether small firms stand to benefit more or less than large firms from corporate environmental performance (e.g., Clemons 2006; Dean et al. 1998; Okada and Sawai 1999). On one hand, large firms may have more resources than small firms allowing for advantages associated with scale and greater investment in R&D and new technologies (D’Amboise and Muldowney 1988; Eden et al. 1997; Woo and Cooper 1981) while small firms may not have the slack resources to address environmental performance (Welsh and White 1981). On the other hand, it is possible that small firms are not burdened by the inertia of their larger counterparts and are more flexible, making them better able to respond to environmental challenges and organizational change (e.g., Chen and Hambrick 1995; Fiegenbaum and Karnani 1991; Storey 1994; Yu 2001).\n\nThus, arguments have been made that large firms should benefit more than small or private firms from environmental performance, as well as vice versa, resulting in a lack of guidance for future research and organizations alike. In meta-analyzing the moderating effect of firm size in the CEP–CFP relationship, our objective is to answer the question of whether the benefits of environmental performance are the same or different for large versus small firms.\n\n# Public Versus Private Firms\n\nIn addition to size, organizational form may influence the CEP–CFP relationship. Public firms, whose shares are traded on a stock exchange, often receive higher levels of media attention and public interest making them better able to capitalize on reputational benefits achieved through environmental performance, whereas privately owned firms may have difficulty differentiating themselves via environmental performance if publicity surrounding the organization is low. At the same time, private firms receiving less attention from the press, the public, and environmental stakeholders may differ from public firms because they are able to use more discretion in the types of environmental initiatives they choose to implement, while public firms may feel pressured to adopt a wide range of environmental initiatives regardless of potential profitability (Dean et al. 1998).\n\nTherefore, arguments can be made for benefits of both public and private firms. As such, it is important to meta-analyze the moderating effect of corporate form to shed light on the nature of this relationship. In doing so, we will enhance our understanding of whether performance benefits from CEP are the same or different for public versus private firms.\n\n# US Versus International Firms\n\nRecently, researchers have begun to look beyond US firms to examine the CEP–CFP link in firms based in other countries (e.g., Bansel 2005; Judge and Elenkov 2005; Menguc and Ozanne 2005), however, the majority of CEP–CFP research uses samples consisting of US-based corporations (i.e., Fortune 500). A firm’s ability to capitalize on environmental performance may be influenced by differences in economic, social, legal, and political environments. Economic disparity may lead to differences in resource scarcity which may affect environmental attitudes and practices (Zhu et al. 2007). In certain national contexts, the relationship between CEP and CFP may be influenced by social norms, public pressure, and expectations regarding environmental practices (Pasquero 1991; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). In addition to attitudinal differences, variation in environmental regulations and enforcement may also influence the CEP–CFP link (Christmann 2000) with firms in countries with stricter regulations regarding environmental issues facing stronger threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
