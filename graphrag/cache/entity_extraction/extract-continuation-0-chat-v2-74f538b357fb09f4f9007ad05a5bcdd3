Taylor\nThe University of Texas at Arlington\n\n# ABSTRACT:\n\nThe relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has long been debated. Ullman (1985) pointed out that the conflicting results could be influenced by many factors, such as sample size, industrial context, inconsistent measurement of CSP and CFP, research methodologies, and procedures for data collection and analysis. This paper addresses Ullman’s (1985) concerns by providing a more methodologically rigorous review of the CSP-CFP relationship than prior research studies. A meta-analysis of 198 studies yields a total sample size of 31,514 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that sustainability performance likely increases a firm’s financial performance, especially in the long run. Compared to social sustainability, environmental sustainability, to a larger extent, contributes to the positive CSP-CFP relationship. In addition, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators. Multi-industry, pre-2000 studies, and non-U.S. sample firms seem to show a stronger impact on the positive relationship between CSP and CFP than other sample indicators. A final finding is that the methodology used in the analysis has a significant impact on the results.\n\nKeywords: meta-analysis; sustainability performance; financial performance; moderators.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn a global economy, competition among companies occurs not only in financial numbers, but also in sustainability development. Sustainability performance and disclosure become increasingly important factors in the competitive success of companies. The term ‘‘sustainability’’ means different things to different stakeholders, because different stakeholders have different concerns. For example, environmentalists may be more concerned with the reduction in air pollution and water usage, and in the recycling of waste. Customers, on the other hand, may have concerns related to product quality and product safety. In this paper, we use the definition from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) that defines ‘‘sustainability’’ as follows:\n\n‘‘Sustainability’’ is a term that has emerged over time from the ‘‘triple bottom-line’’ consideration of (1) economic viability, (2) social responsibility, and (3) environmental responsibility . . . While environmental considerations are often the focus of attention, the triple-bottom-line definition of sustainability is a broad concept. In addition to preservation of the physical environment and stewardship of natural resources, sustainability considers the economic and social context of doing business and also encompasses the business systems, models and behaviors necessary for long-term value creation. (AICPA 2013)\n\nThe authors thank Ervin L. Black (editor) and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments. In addition, helpful feedback was gained when the paper was presented at the 2014 American Accounting Association International Accounting Section Meeting.\n\nSupplemental materials can be accessed by clicking the links in Appendix A.\n\nEditor’s note: Accepted by Ervin L. Black.\n\nSubmitted: February 2014\nAccepted: March 2015\nPublished Online: March 2015\n\n1 The term ‘‘sustainability’’ is often used interchangeably with ‘‘sustainable development,’’ ‘‘corporate social responsibility,’’ ‘‘corporate responsibility,’’ ‘‘corporate citizenship,’’ and ‘‘social enterprise.’’ Although these terms are different, they all point in the same direction: the responsibility of a company toward stakeholders.\n\n# Lu and Taylor\n\nThere is a large body of literature that has produced conflicting results in explaining the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Prior research on the relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) suggests that the current findings are too mixed to draw a generalizable conclusion. Ullman (1985) pointed out that the conflicting results could be attributed to many factors including variations in sample size, and different industrial contexts, inconsistent measurement of CSP and CFP, as well as different research methodologies and procedures for data collection and analysis. Most of the research on the relationship between CSP and CFP has used either market-based or accounting-based measures for financial performance.\n\nTo address the issues raised by Ullman (1985), the current study applies meta-analysis procedure to get a better understanding of the factors that affect the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Meta-analysis is a statistical method of integrating research results across studies on the same subject (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). It is often used when there are many studies with conflicting empirical results.\n\nOrlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) applied meta-analysis to 52 studies and documented that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility, is likely to be beneficial to future financial performance. Orlitzky et al. (2003) also found that corporate reputation\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUCY LU<|>PERSON<|>Lucy Lu is an author affiliated with Bradley University, contributing to research on sustainability performance and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN E TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Martin E.
