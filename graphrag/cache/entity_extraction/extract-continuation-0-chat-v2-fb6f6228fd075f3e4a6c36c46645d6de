This is the great contribution of this article.\n\nBased on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature. The OCS1 is the most relevant in the analyzed sample of articles. The OCS6 and OCS7 were the ones with the lowest number of articles, providing indications that still need further investigation. It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.\n\nIn practice, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization in order to achieve a certain expected sustainability benefit. Besides, the framework provides an overview on core aspects that can serve as basis for a comprehensive sustainability performance measurement system, providing a structured decision-making background for practitioners. This is crucial since decisions regarding sustainable issues combine a series of factors such as social responsibility issues, risks, economic issues, personal preferences and others (Maroušek et al., 2014) and according to Maroušek (2013) decision-makers of the current generation, who have more contact with academic knowledge, are more concerned with sustainability.\n\nThe second contribution is related to the overview of the studies that addressed OCS. Overall, through the overview, it was possible to identify the evolution of the research on the subject (Fig. 3), the research methods (Fig. 4), and the sustainability pillars over the years (Fig. 5). We also identified the business arrangement (Fig. 6), the industrial sector (Table 1), as well as the countries where the empirical studies were carried out (Fig. 7). Finally, a cluster analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords over time (Fig. 8) was developed.\n\nThe third contribution of this research was the presentation of a research agenda developed from the overview of the articles and the proposed framework. We concluded that various OCS and CSB still need to be identified and better explored in the literature, as well as the companies. The research agenda is important because it aids researchers by presenting several options for new studies, which allow furthering the knowledge on these themes (Fig. 10). Briefly, the research agenda shows that more qualitative and mixed research is needed, with a primary focus on the social pillar, or the three pillars together (social, environmental and economic), in the context of different productive arrangements (such as industrial clusters), multinationals companies, and in developing and different.\n\n# 6.2. Limitations and opportunities for future research\n\nThis paper has some limitations. For example, in relation to the search and selection of articles related to the OCS, only one database was adopted. We use exclusion criteria such as conference documents and refinement by categories of research areas. This may have led to the loss of content. Thus, if other researchers refined this research using other criteria different results could be found. The research also focused on linking the OCS knowledge area with the CSBs and their results are based on this relationship. Future research can broaden the scope of OCS research using different search criteria, deepen the relationships found between OCSs and CSBs, or explore different relationships between OCSs and sustainability.\n\nAnother limitation is related to the lack of empirical validation of the developed framework. However, the relationships contemplated in the framework were developed from mapping the results from previous literature, which materializes its support. Even so, future research may validate the relations between OCS and CSB presented in the framework through empirical research, and, analyzing the practical results of this relationship.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThis research was also funded in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance code: 1809142\n\n# References\n\nAlbort-Morant, G., Leal-Millán, A., Cepeda-Carrión, G., 2016.
