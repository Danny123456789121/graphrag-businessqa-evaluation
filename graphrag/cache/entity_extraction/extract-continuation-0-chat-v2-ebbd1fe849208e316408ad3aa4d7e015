However, as generative AI continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please see Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).\n\n# Box 1\n\n# How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases\n\nTo assess the potential value of generative AI, we updated a proprietary McKinsey database of potential AI use cases and drew on the experience of more than 100 experts in industries and their business functions.1 Our updates examined use cases of generative AI—specifically, how generative AI techniques (primarily transformer-based neural networks) can be used to solve problems not well addressed by previous technologies.\n\nWe analyzed only use cases for which generative AI could deliver a significant improvement in the outputs that drive key value. In particular, our estimates of the primary value the technology could unlock do not include use cases for which the sole benefit would be its ability to use natural language. For example, natural-language capabilities would be the key driver of value in a customer service use case but not in a use case optimizing a logistics network, where value primarily arises from quantitative analysis.\n\nWe then estimated the potential annual value of these generative AI use cases if they were adopted across the entire economy. For use cases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some of those in sales and marketing, we estimated the economy-wide value generative AI could deliver by increasing the productivity of sales and marketing expenditures.\n\nOur estimates are based on the structure of the global economy in 2022 and do not consider the value generative AI could create if it produced entirely new product or service categories.\n\n1 “Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.\n\nIn this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: business function and modality.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Value potential by function\n\nWhile generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3). Our analysis of 16 business functions identified just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately 75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.\n\n# Exhibit 3\n\nUsing generative AI in just a few functions could drive most of the technology’s impact across potential corporate use cases.\n\n|Represent ~75% of total annual impact of generative AI|Represent ~75% of total annual impact of generative AI|\n|---|\n|500|Sales|\n|400|Marketing|\n|400|Software engineering (for corporate IT)|\n|300|Software engineering (for product development)|\n|200|Customer operations|\n|200|Product R&D|\n|100|Supply chain|\n|100|Manufacturing|\n|100|Finance|\n|100|Risk and compliance|\n|100|Talent and organization (incl HR)|\n|100|Procurement management|\n|100|Corporate IT¹|\n|100|Legal|\n|100|Strategy|\n|0|Pricing|\n\nImpact, $ billion\n\nImpact as a percentage of functional spend, %\n\nNote: Impact is averaged.\n\n¹Excluding software engineering.\n\nSource: Comparative Industry Service (CIS), IHS Markit; Oxford Economics; McKinsey Corporate and Business Functions database; McKinsey Manufacturing and Supply Chain 360; McKinsey Sales Navigator; Ignite, a McKinsey database; McKinsey analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nNotably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent in our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, is now much lower. This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which exclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers for previous applications of AI.\n\n12  The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Generative AI as a virtual expert\n\nIn addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in function-specific use cases, the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal knowledge management systems. Generative AI’s impressive command of natural-language processing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries in the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This could empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make better-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.\n\nIn 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about a fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly “read” vast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source material in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable solution than hiring a team of human experts for the task.\n\nFollowing are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual expert in a handful of use cases.\n\nIn addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in specific use cases, the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal knowledge management systems.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier 13\n\n# How customer operations could be transformed\n\n# Customer self-service interactions\n\nCustomer interacts with a humanlike chatbot that delivers immediate, personalized responses to complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that provides insights and strategies to businesses, including the potential value of generative AI across various functions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can create content, including text, images, and other media, and has the potential to revolutionize various industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER OPERATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Customer operations involve managing interactions with customers, including support and service, which can be enhanced by generative AI technologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALES AND MARKETING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sales and marketing functions focus on promoting and selling products or services, where generative AI can significantly increase productivity and effectiveness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software engineering encompasses the design, development, and maintenance of software systems, which can benefit from generative AI applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research and development (R&D) involves innovating and improving products or services, where generative AI can drive significant advancements.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>McKinsey & Company analyzes the potential value of generative AI across various business functions and industries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>CUSTOMER OPERATIONS<|>Generative AI can transform customer operations by enabling personalized and efficient customer interactions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>SALES AND MARKETING<|>Generative AI can enhance sales and marketing efforts by improving productivity and effectiveness in these functions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<|>Generative AI can be applied in software engineering to improve development processes and outcomes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<|>Generative AI can drive advancements in research and development by facilitating innovation and improving product design<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
