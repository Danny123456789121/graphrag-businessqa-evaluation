Due to the various information channels and effective market supervision, business information will be more symmetric and valid in a developed market. Then, the stakeholders can obtain information about firms’ social behavior more efficiently and make responses more accurately. Subsequently, those responses for CSR will turn into positive financial gains. But the situation is different in a developing market. Short of advanced media exposure and efficient market supervision, the active and initiative social efforts of firms competing in less developed markets will be less noticed and gain unequal financial gains compared with those in well-developed markets.\n\nAside from the market environment, the institutional environments are also different between developed and developing economies, and such institutional variations in a cross-national context may moderate the degree to which stakeholders can influence managers (Campbell, 2007). Campbell (2007) has argued that the relationship between socially responsible corporate behavior and economic conditions is moderated by several institutional factors, such as public and private regulations, the presence of nongovernmental and other independent organizations that monitor corporate behavior, institutionalized norms regarding appropriate corporate behavior, associative behavior among corporations themselves, and organized dialogues among corporations and their stakeholders. In a developed market, the local government will publish specific policies to encourage firms to take social responsibility. For example, local communities may provide a philanthropic firm with tax breaks or favorable terms for using local infrastructure (H. Wang et al., 2008). Then firms may decrease costs and increase income via CSR thereby increasing CFP. But in a less developed market, firms cannot gain such positive returns without well-forced institutional systems. Under a loose and ineffective governmental regulation, corporations would act in more socially irresponsible ways and would not worry about the potential risk of regulatory sanctions. Thus, those socially unresponsive firms incur fewer direct costs and, ceteris paribus, reap higher profits than socially responsive firms. In that sense, socially responsive companies are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their unresponsive peers. This competitive disadvantage is particularly serious in an era of increased globalization, because the capacity for\n\n# Business & Society\n\nfirms to move investments and productions from one regulatory regime to another has increased. To retain local investment, production, jobs, and tax revenues, some national governments would ease business regulations that help militate against socially irresponsible corporate behavior (Campbell, 2007). Thus, corporations may not be able to gain competitive advantages from socially responsible behavior. So based on the above logic, the authors posit the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 5:\n\nThe relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from developed economies than from developing economies.\n\n# Method\n\n# Data-Collection\n\nTo ensure the representativeness and completeness of the study database, a three-stage sampling procedure was conducted to identify literature to be included in the meta-analysis (Barnett, 2007; Godfrey, 2005; Margolis & Walsh, 2003). In the first stage, the authors searched the ABI/INFORM database for studies published from 2003 to 2012 with the following search terms: corporate social responsibility, corporate social performance, environmental performance, and financial performance. Second, a manual search of several relevant journals (Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Strategic Management Journal, Organizational Studies, and Journal of Business Ethics) was also conducted. Third, the authors examined the reference sections of all major reviews of research previously published on the topic to identify any studies overlooked in the previous two stages.\n\nStudies were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis on the basis of three criteria. First, the meta-analysis included only those empirical studies that reported sample sizes and an outcome statistic (r, univariate F, t, χ²) that allowed the computation of a correlation coefficient with the formulas provided by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). Results that only reported multivariate models were excluded. Second, only those studies that measured constructs at the firm level were included. Third, studies were considered independent only when they reported correlation coefficients from different samples. So the results based on data used in other studies that were already included were excluded. Upon completion of the literature retrieval procedures, the authors obtained a total of 119 effect sizes reported in 42 studies. The complete collection of studies is summarized in the appendix.\n\nTo reduce coding error, the authors prepared a coding protocol specifying the information to be extracted from each study. The coding form was prepared.\n\n# Data-Analysis\n\nThe authors conducted this meta-analysis according to the guidelines provided by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). First of all, we converted the reported statistics into a common effect size. To account for the skewness of the distribution of sample correlation coefficients, we transformed the correlation into Fisher’s z coefficients with the formula *y = 0.5 × logi (1 + ri)/(1 - ri). Then the authors averaged and weighted the z coefficients by the formula Vi = 1/(N - 3)*.\n\nThere are two general models: the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model. The fixed-effects meta-analysis assumes the population effect sizes are equal for all studies, so the differences on the observed effect sizes are due to sampling error. As for the random-effects model, the population effect sizes can be different across studies (Hedges & Vevea, 1998). The differences on the observed effect sizes are due to a combination of true difference (variance component) and sampling error. It is usually preferred methodologically. The authors conducted a homogeneity test with the R package to determine whether a fixed- or random-effects model should be used. Under the assumption of homogeneity (H0: β1 = β2 = β3 = ... = βk), the test statistic Q has a chi-square distribution with df = (No. of studies − 1). In the authors’ database, Q is equal to 275.3655\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
