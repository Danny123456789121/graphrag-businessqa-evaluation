Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

The loadings on the temperature shock factor for “High” and “Low” capture the average sensitivities of the high-exposure and low-exposure industries, respectively. Consequently, the loading on the temperature shock factor for “High – Low” picks up the sensitivity difference between the high- and low-exposure industries. For the temperature factor we use the primary temperature factor TSF obtained from equation (4).\n\nTo test Hypothesis 2 formally for the size-value portfolios, in Panel B we also form equal-weighted portfolios to and use the primary temperature factor TSF obtained from equation (4). “Small” consists of the five small-capitalization portfolios, and “Big” includes the five large-capitalization portfolios; “Value” contains the five value portfolios, and “Growth” comprises the five growth portfolios. “Small – Big” picks up the difference between small and big stocks, and “Value – Growth” does the same for value and growth stocks.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n38\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n|Panel A: Industry portfolios| | | |Panel B: Size and BM portfolios| | | | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Alpha|MKT|TSF|R2| |Size|BM|Alpha|MKT|TSF|R2| |\n|Food|0.24|0.73|-2.83|0.55| | |Growth|-0.65|1.41|-6.73|0.61| |\n|Beer|0.20|0.78|-4.11|0.44| |2| |-0.20|1.26|-13.08|0.67| |\n|Smoke|0.50|0.69|-4.28|0.25| |Small|3|-0.19|1.13|-16.84|0.74| |\n|Games|-0.17|1.33|-9.65|0.66| | |4|-0.03|1.09|-20.60|0.79| |\n|Books|-0.17|1.09|-7.87|0.69| | |Value|-0.10|1.17|-27.15|0.84| |\n|Hshld|0.15|0.84|-0.74|0.60| | |Growth|-0.31|1.36|0.56|0.73| |\n|Clths|-0.25|1.13|-12.73|0.62| |2| |-0.14|1.19|-9.78|0.79| |\n|Hlth|0.45|0.84|5.69|0.59| |2|3|0.00|1.10|-14.57|0.83| |\n|Chems|-0.11|1.07|-4.46|0.71| |4| |-0.08|1.08|-18.98|0.87| |\n|Txtls|-0.53|1.21|-24.02|0.62| | |Value|-0.20|1.21|-26.27|0.89| |\n|Cnstr|-0.33|1.22|-11.07|0.80| | |Growth|-0.13|1.28|2.50|0.79| |\n|Steel|-0.54|1.34|-9.97|0.65| | |2|-0.01|1.12|-7.61|0.84| |\n|FabPr|-0.17|1.22|-5.27|0.78| |3|3|-0.04|1.05|-11.87|0.86| |\n|ElcEq|0.09|1.22|-1.61|0.73| | |4|0.00|1.03|-15.94|0.87| |\n|Autos|-0.38|1.18|-13.12|0.59| | |Value|-0.07|1.11|-22.65|0.87| |\n|Carry|-0.02|1.14|-7.96|0.60| | |Growth|0.05|1.18|5.12|0.86| |\n|Mines|-0.19|0.97|-7.46|0.33| | |2|-0.08|1.08|-4.51|0.88| |\n|Coal|0.14|1.17|-5.42|0.28| |4|3|0.00|1.06|-9.12|0.86| |\n|Oil|0.32|0.81|2.16|0.46| |4| |-0.01|1.01|-13.20|0.86| |\n|Util|0.15|0.56|-3.31|0.38| | |Value|-0.16|1.12|-18.11|0.82| |\n|Telcm|0.16|0.75\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
