Relations between organizational capabilities and expected corporate sustainability benefits\n\nThe OCS1 are those most frequent within the analyzed paper sample (29 publications in total); OCS6 and OCS7 were those with the lowest number of papers (10 and 11 in total, respectively). It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.\n\nIt can be seen that OCS1, OCS2 and OCS3 have a larger number of articles that have studied it and are also the pioneers, being first studied in 1998 by Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) and continued to gain relevance over the years. Already COS5 is the most recent, with studies from 2011.\n\nSince we identified the OCS categories, we extracted from the papers the expected corporate sustainability benefits related to OCS. Similar to the OCSs, such benefits have also been grouped into categories in order to synthesize knowledge and facilitate the understanding and operationalization of these constructs.\n\nThe sustainability benefits related to OCS were grouped into ten categories according to the similarity of their approaches. They are presented in the first column of Table 4 (the studies are presented as codes - see Appendix 1): support for environmental strategy/strategic proactivity (CSB1), sustainable innovation support (CSB2), support for environmental management systems/tools/practices (CSB3), improving the absorption of knowledge on sustainable issues (CSB4), support for corporate social responsibility (CSB5), green supply chain support (CSB6), improving environmental collaboration (CSB7), improving environmental adaptability (CSB8), improving green marketing (CSB9), and improving firm performance (CSB10).\n\nThe second column of Table 4 describes in detail these CSB categories and indicates how the literature relates them to the seven categories of OCSs. It can be observed that a large number of studies have addressed OCSs related to CSB10, CSB2 and CSB6. A low number of papers related to CSB8 and CSB4.\n\n|Categories of expected corporate sustainability benefits (CSBs)|Benefit Detailing| | |OCS Categories| | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |OCS1|OCS2|OCS3|OCS4|OCS5|OCS6|OCS7| |\n|Support for environmental strategy / strategic proactivity (CSB1)|Support environmental strategic proactivity capability|1; 13|17;|79;|1;| |79; 1|13|\n|Support sustainable strategy| |33|55; 88;|88; 80| |80| | |\n|Impact on sustainable strategies based on innovation| | | | |23| | | |\n|Support proactive environmental management capability| | | | |79| | | |\n|Support/increase sustainable innovation/clean technologies| |52; 21| | | | | | |\n|Influence sustainable innovation|57|31|62| |68| | | |\n|Support for sustainable innovation (CSB2)|Influence the integration of the environment with the development of new products|19|24| |31| | | |\n|Influence the performance of green products and process innovation|63|4; 70;|4|70| |81| | |\n|Support sustainable product development processes| | |55| | | | | |\n|Influence green innovation capability and eco-design capability|28| | | |28| | | |\n|Support technologies for cleaner production|27| | | | | | | |\n|Impact on sustainable strategies based on innovation|85| | | |23| |85| |\n|Support for environmental management systems / tools / practices (CSB3)|Support the development of environmental management systems and related tools|50| |50| | | | |\n|Support the development/adoption of environmental/ socio-environmental practices|18; 47|51;|29; 18;|54|83; 54|83; 84| | |\n|Mediate the relationship between environmental management systems and the company market performance| | |39| | |83| | |\n\n#\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
