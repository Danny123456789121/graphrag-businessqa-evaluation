(9)|n.a.|2,154|f2 g,t|\n\nThe first set of exercises (Rob. 1.1 - Rob 2.3) relate to the greenness and transparency indicator as defined in\nEquation (1). Rob. 1.1 with γ = 0.5 corresponds to the benchmark specification used in Section 5.2, where we assign\nequal weight to the two components of the greenness and transparency indicator, namely the emission intensity and\nthe environmental transparency of a firm. By tuning the parameter γ, we investigate whether attaching more or less\nweight to one of the components of the indicator has an impact on the results. In particular, by imposing γ > 0.5,\nwe construct an indicator where the quality of a firm’s environmental disclosures has a lower weight compared\nto its emission intensity. This version of the indicator attaches a larger weight to hard data and quantitative\ninformation, and a smaller weight to a transparency score which may also rely on descriptive statements and high\nlevel disclosures. Conversely, γ < 0.5 attaches a higher weight to quantitative information and a lower weight to\nthe overall quality and completeness of environmental disclosures. We also investigate the extreme cases for which\nγ = 0 and γ = 1, i.e., the cases for which the indicator Gi,y collapses to the E score Ei,y and to the inverse of the\nranking of emission intensity Ki,y, respectively.\n\nThe second set of exercises (Rob. 3.1 - Rob. 4.3) involves a different specification for the greenness and\ntransparency indicator. In particular, we propose an alternative functional form, where the two components of the\nindicator are related to each other in the form of a ratio. In this specification, we use the emission intensity and\nthe E score as such, while the benchmark specification involves the rankings based on these two indicators. The\nalternative definition is thus as follows:\n\nE∗ (Sales)\n\nGi,y = Ki,y∗ i,y = Ei,y∗\n\n(Emissions)\n\n17\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nwhere Ei,y is the E score and Ki,y is the ratio of total GHG or CO2 emissions over sales. Unlike the indicator in Equation (1), the indicator based on Equation (9) suffers from a non-linearity issue. In particular, a variation in the denominator corresponds to a more than proportional change in the greenness and transparency indicator. This nonlinearity yields an unstable pattern for the greenness and transparency indicator over time for some companies.\n\nIn a further set of robustness checks (Rob.2.1-2.3 and Rob. 4.1-4.3), we expand our sample to include all listed European companies which do some environmental disclosure, i.e. have an E score larger than zero, and those that do no disclosure and belong to brown sectors, as defined in Section 3. By doing so, we more than double the size of the sample, bringing it to 2,154 stocks. However, as discussed in Section 5, enlarging the sample to include mid and small caps may affect the quality of the environmental information used to construct the greenness and transparency indicator. For this reason, in this exercise we still use the greenness and transparency factor as constructed on the smaller, more reliable sample. In particular, the greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio include the same firms as described in Section 3, hence the factor is the same as in the benchmark exercise described in Section 5. However, this factor is used in Rob.2.1-2.3 and Rob. 4.1-4.3 to price a larger set of assets. Formally, referring to Equation (2), this set of robustness checks involves the same factors ft,k as in the benchmark case, but a larger number of stocks N &gt; n.\n\nAdditionally, we check the robustness of the results with respect to the definition of the greenness and transparency factor. In the benchmark case (see Section 5.2) as well as in Rob. 1.1, 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1, we build a portfolio of brown firms selecting the ones belonging to the highest emitting NACE economic sectors, among those that do no environmental disclosure. However, one could argue that the NACE classification is in some cases unsuitable for sustainability analysis. Hence, we build an alternative greenness and transparency factor fg,t based on the returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio ˜g, on the one hand, and those of the portfolio including all non-transparent firms ˜c, on the other. Formally,\n\nfg,t = ˜g − ˜.1 rt rct (10)\n\nRob 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, and 4.2 perform the estimation of risk premia using the greenness and transparency factor fg,t.\n\nFinally, we test yet another specification for the greenness and transparency factor, only based on transparent firms. In particular, we construct the greenness and transparency factor fg,t as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent firms and the firms that do some environmental disclosure, but only attain lower levels of greenness and transparency. The former set of firms correspond to the greener\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
