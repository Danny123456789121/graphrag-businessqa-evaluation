2\n\nOTH\nACC\nACC\nACC\nACC\nACC\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260\n\n# Fig. 1\n\nNumber of climate change-related and climate finance-related articles in leading finance journals (top panel) and elite business journals (bottom panel). Note: Shaded areas are proportional to number of articles.\n\nIn coding, these topics were then refined and clearly defined so they were both discrete (non-overlapping) and exhaustive. In each case, we coded the main topic covered in the article.\n\nTo normalise our samples of climate change-related and climate finance-related articles, we used Scopus ‘Compare Journals’ statistics on the total number of articles published per journal.\n\nA total of 20,725 articles were published in our sample of 21 finance journals from January 1998 to June 2015 (see Table 1).\n\nA total of 31,351 articles were published in our sample of 29 elite business journals over the same time period (see Table 2).\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260\n\nTo account for more recent interest in climate finance, particularly with respect to stranded assets, carbon bubbles and divestment, we created subsamples of articles published during the period January 2012 to June 2015 (see Appendix, Table 3). The Carbon Tracker published its first report in November 2011 which was a milestone in raising general awareness of climate finance topics (Leaton 2011).\n\n# 3 Results\n\nThe results of our content analysis show a remarkable lack of engagement with climate change-related risks and opportunities by leading finance journals and elite business journals.\n\n# 3.1 Climate change-related research\n\nTable 1\nshows that only 12 (0.06%) of the 20,725 articles published in the 21 leading finance journals (Currie and Pandher 2011) since 1998 have related in some way to climate change.\n\nFurthermore, this almost complete lack of engagement with climate change as a research topic is not limited to finance. Table 2\nsimilarly shows that only 74 (0.24%) of the 31,351 articles published by 4* ‘elite’ business journals (ABS 2015) over the same period addressed climate change-related issues (see also Fig. 1).\nThis research gap has scarcely improved in recent years as climate change has grown ever greater in relevance for finance. Over the period January 2012 to June 2015, only 0.10% (leading finance) and 0.49% (elite business) of articles published engaged with climate change (see Appendix, Table 3).\n\nAmong the elite business journals, we find that finance and marketing have not engaged\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATIC CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Climatic Change is a journal that publishes research related to climate change and its impacts, including finance-related articles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON TRACKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Carbon Tracker is an organization that raises awareness about climate finance topics, particularly regarding stranded assets and carbon bubbles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scopus is a bibliographic database containing abstracts and citations for academic journal articles, used for comparing journal statistics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCE JOURNALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leading finance journals publish research articles related to finance, including topics on climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELITE BUSINESS JOURNALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elite business journals are high-ranking academic publications that cover a wide range of business-related topics, including climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANUARY 2012 TO JUNE 2015<|>EVENT<|>This period marks a significant time frame for analyzing the engagement of finance and business journals with climate change-related research.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON TRACKER<|>CLIMATIC CHANGE<|>The Carbon Tracker published its first report in November 2011, which raised awareness about climate finance topics, relevant to the research published in Climatic Change.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPUS<|>FINANCE JOURNALS<|>Scopus provides statistics on the total number of articles published per journal, including leading finance journals.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPUS<|>ELITE BUSINESS JOURNALS<|>Scopus provides statistics on the total number of articles published per journal, including elite business journals.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JANUARY 2012 TO JUNE 2015<|>CLIMATIC CHANGE<|>The period from January 2012 to June 2015 is analyzed for engagement with climate change-related research in the journal Climatic Change.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JANUARY 2012 TO JUNE 2015<|>FINANCE JOURNALS<|>The engagement of leading finance journals with climate change-related research is analyzed during this period.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JANUARY 2012 TO JUNE 2015<|>ELITE BUSINESS JOURNALS<|>The engagement of elite business journals with climate change-related research is analyzed during this period.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
