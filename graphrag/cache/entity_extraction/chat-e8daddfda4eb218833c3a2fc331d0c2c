Consequently, they provide little evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or comparison between different events.\n\nRecently, Elayan et al. (2014) have also used data from Covalence EthicalQuote, but they only consider aggregated information. However, their results suggest that these pieces of information convey useful information to shareholders.\n\nThe richness of the database allows us to test a broad set of hypotheses. We first set apart positive and negative ESG news and examine a possible asymmetric impact. We also consider whether shareholders’ perception is different whether the news is related to environmental, social or corporate governance issues. Further, we pay attention to the source of the news. Is the impact the same whether the news is published by the media, the firms themselves or NGOs? And do shareholders react differently when the news is published in a financial newspaper or a media devoted to CSR? We also investigate whether the impact of CSR on stock prices has evolved over time, and whether geographic and cultural proximity between events and shareholders matters. We also carry out a content (textual) analysis to characterize more precisely each news. Finally, we test whether the reputation may serve as a “reservoir of goodwill” in times of crisis.\n\nOur results show that firms coping with ESG negative events experience a low but significant drop in their market value. On average, in our sample, the decrease is of 0.1% on a window of 3 days around the announcement. On the contrary, companies coping with positive events do not experience any significant change in their market value. In addition, it seems that stock market penalties do not vary significantly over time, which challenges the conventional idea of a raising awareness on ESG issues. Our results also indicate that sector’s ESG reputation mitigates the loss and that market participants only react to information disclosed by the media and not to firm press releases; in other words, investors do not seem to be fooled by the efforts of companies to appear at their best. Finally, the loss is larger when there is a cultural proximity between shareholders and the event and when the content of a news has a quantitative, an economic or a legal orientation.\n\nThis research might have a number of important implications for both shareholders, companies and activists concerning CSR disclosures. Indeed, this paper provides guidance to understand when ESG news are likely to influence firm’s value. This paper also contributes to the literature on greenwashing effectiveness and NGOs influence. Furthermore, our contribution is not limited to CSR issues as our work may be related to the growing body of economic research on how shareholders process information.\n\nThe reminder of the paper is organized as follows. “Related Empirical Papers” section surveys the related literature about the impact of ESG news on stock prices. “Hypotheses Development” section provides some theoretical background and posits a set of testable hypotheses. “A Two-Step Hypotheses Testing Procedure” section describes the data and the variables, while the event study methodology is briefly presented in “Data on ESG News” section. The econometric analysis is implemented in “The\n\n# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\nImpact of ESG News on Stock Prices’’ section, and the results are discussed. ‘‘Conclusion’’ section concludes.\n\n# Related Empirical Papers\n\nSeveral academic papers have aimed at assessing the reaction of shareholders to various types of extra-financial events, in particular events harmful to the environment.4 Most of them focused on public environmental disclosure programs (mainly the US Toxic Release Inventory; e.g., Hamilton 1995), judicial actions following environmental violations (e.g., Karpoff et al. 2005), or industrial accidents causing ecological damages (e.g., Capelle-Blancard and Laguna 2010). Some academic papers also consider the impact of ‘‘bad’’ social or corporate governance practices on firms’ market value. This includes a very diverse set of events: product recalls (e.g., Jarrell and Peltzman 1985), airline crashes (e.g., Borenstein and Zimmerman 1988), product tampering (Mitchell 1989), corporate fraud (e.g., Karpoff and Lott 1993; Chaney and Philipich 2002), ‘‘unethical behavior’’ (Gunthorpe 1997), social movements and protests (King and Soule 2007) or massive layoffs (e.g., Farber and Hallock 2009). These studies provided salient results and showed, overall, that the market penalty may go beyond the direct cost for the company, although apparently without providing sufficient incentives for corporate executives to behave differently.\n\nA common limit of these previous papers, however, is that they focus on extreme events. Oil spills, industrial accidents, toxic releases, product tampering, corporate frauds, etc., have a significant negative impact: this is a well-established fact. But what about less dramatic events? How do shareholders react to ‘‘ordinary’’ news? This question is important for at least three reasons. First of all, CSR does not consist merely in avoiding ecological or social disasters. Instead, according to its proponents, CSR should be embedded in all corporate operations, at every stage; CSR is a matter of day-to-day practices. Accordingly, everyday events should be addressed to assess corporate social performance. Second, all previous studies focus on few industries (particularly the petrochemical firms) which are prone to extreme events, while all firms should be involved. Specifically, the stock market impact of CSR in services or for high-tech companies is largely ignored, whereas these industries represent a large and growing part of the economic activity.
