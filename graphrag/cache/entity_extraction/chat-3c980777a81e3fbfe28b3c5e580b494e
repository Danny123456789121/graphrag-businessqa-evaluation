The accounting sector can play a role in environmental conservation efforts related to environmental costs, and the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) could be a key factor that can improve the company’s financial performance. This study aims to determine how green accounting through the application of CSMS can improve the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country. The sampling method used was purposive sampling, while the research sample consisted of 38 companies that had followed PROPER and were indexed on the IDX. Data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs by earmarking a portion to carry CSMS implementation so as to improve financial performance. People in Indonesia consider that manufacturing companies that have good company rankings in the evaluation program for company performance ratings in environmental management run by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment are in a position to generate customer loyalty, especially in financial performance.\n\n# Keywords\n\nGreen Accounting, Financial Performance, Corporate Sustainability Management System\n\n# JEL Classification Code\n\nQ56, Q58, G23\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe increasingly numerous and varied human activities have an impact on the natural environment. People in meeting their daily needs can have an impact on the environment. Environmental impacts occur because humans tend to exploit natural resources from the environment in an excessive manner, not just maintaining the necessities of life. As a result of these human activities, the environment is damaged. Environmental damage is getting worse along with the development of industrial and technological companies. In the end, environmental damage has a negative impact on human life. On the one hand, industry has an impact on the environment, but on the other hand, the industrial world can have an impact on the economic development of a country. Companies in managing natural resources have the potential to impose negative risks on environmental aspects. For this reason, companies need to make a commitment to the environment and the social dimension as the main and inseparable part of the company’s operational activities. In making it happen, the company complements its operational activities with environmental management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations, for example, the Environmental Impact Analysis Documents. Environmental management efforts aim to estimate the impact that will arise from operations, evaluate, and find appropriate solutions to overcome them.\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\n\nI Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\n\nThe accounting sector can play a role in environmental conservation efforts, namely, through voluntary disclosure of the green manufacturing is to save the environment and to reduce the cost of the product (Paul et al., 2014). An accounting system that discloses accounts related to environmental costs is known as green accounting. Disclosure of environmental activities and environmental costs in the company’s annual report will provide an overview to users of the company’s financial statements, which can help users make decisions for company programs related to environmental preservation in the future. The environmental conservation program carried out by the company will be positively perceived by the community. In the end, the community will have high trust in the company. The trust that arises will encourage people to be loyal to the company. Environmental performance can have a significant effect on a company’s financial position (Miroshnychenko et al., 2017). It also shows the need for adequate environmental cost information. Green accounting, in this case, is one of the sources of a company’s financial performance. Besides that, corporate sustainable development also plays an equally important role.\n\n# 2. Literature Review and Hypotheses\n\n# 2.1. Green Accounting\n\nSustainability stands out among the most vital management paradigms that key business leaders must react to today in search of competitive success (Bansal, 2005; Fakir & Jusoh, 2020). Bansal (2005), a leading author, argues that almost inevitably companies that do not react to sustainability will face extinction. Likewise, some say that the capability to incorporate sustainability into corporate strategy and stakeholder engagement will determine which businesses will grow in the 21st century and which businesses will fail (Andriosopoulos, 2016; Napitupulu et al., 2020). Considering these dauntless claims, it is obviously important to know how businesses adapt to sustainability. Azapagic (2003) formulates the concept of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) into five stages, namely, sustainable development policy, planning, implementation, communication, and review and corrective action. These five stages are conceptualized into four indicators, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental.\n\nCompanies are currently required to improve their performance, namely by increasing their productivity. Productivity can be measured by comparing output and input during the production process. In this case, the company is required to pay attention to consumer tastes by increasing the quality and quantity of its products.
