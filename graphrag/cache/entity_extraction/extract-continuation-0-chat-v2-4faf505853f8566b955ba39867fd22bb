They further challenge the seemingly accepted notion that financial activists tend to be more effective in achieving their goals than social activists.\n\nWhile these findings extend the academic literature on shareholder activism, they also have potential implications for managers, activists, and policy-makers. For managers, the knowledge that low female board representation attracts activists and that both financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists are successful in improving gender diversity may lead them to improve board gender diversity without the impetus of a formal shareholder.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

For activists, the knowledge that prior activists have been successful in improving gender diversity may inspire new initiatives, particularly for socially-motivated activists.\n\nHowever, we note that while our results indicate that shareholder activism is an effective means of improving corporate board gender diversity, mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the 20 percent or 30 percent thresholds that are sought by various activist groups, even in the post-proposal period. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these more ambitious goals. To best inform policy-makers, more research is needed to understand the consequences of alternative regulatory responses, from mandated quotas to “softer” initiatives including “comply-or-explain” disclosure requirements that have been introduced in recent years (Adams et al., 2015).\n\nFuture research can also help us better understand the antecedents and consequences of female board representation. Hillman (2015) asks whether the different outcomes of increased female board representation depend on how the increase was achieved. For example, does the role that women play on the board, such as committee membership or board tenure differ depending on whether the female appointment is voluntary, through the introduction of a legal quota, or as a result of activism? Does the method of appointment affect other outcomes, such as subsequent firm performance and board monitoring? That is, is the method of appointment a moderating variable between female representation and outcomes? Also, does female board representation increase female representation at other levels within the firm (Ferreira, 2015) and does this depend on how the increase is achieved?\n\nFurther, is shareholder activism an effective mechanism for addressing broader gender inequities such as equal employment opportunity reporting for all levels within a firm? Future work is needed to address these important questions.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n# Future Work and Limitations\n\nSeveral areas for future work also arise from the inherent limitations of our study. We have relied on two theoretical perspectives in framing our analysis – that of agency theory and institutional theory – but acknowledge that other theoretical perspectives might also afford insight into gender diversity questions. For example, resource dependency theory or social network theory might also provide equally useful perspectives in this line of inquiry. Future research might consider related questions from these alternative vantage points.\n\nA second limitation is that we dichotomize our sample of shareholder proposals into two groups based on the motivation of the activist (i.e., either financially- or socially-motivated). However, motivations cannot be observed directly, and we must infer motivation from stated objectives of activist groups. While we conduct two tests to gain confidence that our classification scheme has reasonable construct validity, there may be some measurement error in determining activist motivation. Alternative research methods for exploring the motivations of activists, including field-based studies, could be useful here.\n\nAlso, our findings likely understate the effectiveness of shareholder activism in this setting. The proposals we examine call for both gender and racial diversity, but restrictions in the RiskMetrics database preclude us from evaluating outcomes regarding race over our period of interest. Therefore, we are unable to tabulate improvements to board diversity related to racial diversity. Future research might address the question of racial diversity and shareholder activism.\n\nAs a last point, while we focus on shareholder activism, Aguilera et al. (2015) propose that internal mechanisms, like board structure and ownership structure, and external mechanisms, like shareholder activism or media, can work together to improve governance effectiveness. An example would be the confluence of an active board, activist shareholders, and high levels of media scrutiny working together to influence strategic decisions and firm.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, future research could identify different configurations of internal and external mechanisms to better understand the drivers of effective corporate governance.\n\n# ENDNOTES\n\n1.
