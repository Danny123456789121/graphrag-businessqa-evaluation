Moderating factors analysis.\n\nNote: Unless otherwise stated, the subgroup H1 represents results greater than the respective average of the selected moderating factor. H2 represents the subgroup below the subgroup average. z ri and z pb i are the corresponding z-values for the subgroup means. The additional index (1) indicates the first-order level. See text for abbreviations. The significance values are: *p &lt; 0.10; **p &lt; 0.05; and ***p &lt; 0.01.\n\npublication year of the primary studies in each meta-analysis (pb i = 0.132 vs pbi = 0.194), the results indicate that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes (Table 5). However, the attenuation factors applied by the first-order meta-analytical reviewers for these two groups differ considerably. Relatively older meta-analyses used on average an attenuation factor of 0.66 in comparison to younger analyses (0.78). We also assess the relation on first-order level with data on 551 primary studies to rule out a distortion of initial results from changing meta-analytical methods and correction factors over time. This verification uncovers that the pattern of a correlation-level shrink is no longer observable as the differences in r 1 ð ) and p( ) do not exist anymore (0.002 and b 1 -0.002). Based on this extensive set of primary studies that avoids potential distortions through different meta-analytical attenuation factors, Hypothesis 4a cannot be confirmed.\n\nWhen separating our meta-analytical results into dichotomous groups depending on the number of underlying studies (n), we retrieve two summary effects that are marginally and insignificantly different from each other. Larger studies tend to be negligibly weaker in effect size (pb i = 0.153) in comparison to smaller studies (pbi = 0.160). We conclude that the CSP-CFP relation is not dependent on the study sample size as the difference is non-significant. Larger studies in our sample produce equally strong relations compared to smaller samples which can be interpreted as another sign of the stability of the CSP-CFP relation. Thus, we reject Hypothesis 4b.\n\nAs no meta-study in our sample was published in an economics, finance, or accounting journal, we are limited to sub-effects in SIM journals and GM journals. We determine, in contrast to findings at primary study level, even significant lower effect sizes of meta-analyses in SIM journals (p = 0.115) compared to GM journals (pb i = 0.174). These are interesting findings since prior research proposed the opposite. Working paper studies exhibit attenuated effect sizes comparable with those in published papers (r i = 0.115) but disattenuated effect sizes deviate significantly from those in published papers (pbi = 0.186 vs 0.152). Moreover, we find that higher-impact factor journals (factor 5.1 on average for the sample) produce significantly higher correlations than lower-impact factor journals (pb i = 0.177 vs pbi = 0.127).
