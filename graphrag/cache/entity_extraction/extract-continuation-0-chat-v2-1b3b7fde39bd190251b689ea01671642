In the latter case we converted the sign of the correlation. With regard to the presence of a CSR committee, we conformed to the existing literature (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Mallin & Michelon, 2011) and regarded “environmental committees,” “sustainability committees,” or “corporate ethics committees” as CSR committees. Our focal dependent construct, CSR, was measured in a variety of ways, reflecting its multidimensional nature. Most of the studies in our sample use aggregate measures of CSR combining different environmental and social aspects (e.g., aggregate indices based on the items of the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini [KLD] database). For our moderator analysis, we were primarily interested in potential differences between the environmental and social dimensions of CSR (Bansal et al., 2014). Therefore, we sought to keep these dimensions apart whenever it was possible. In particular, we built composites in the case of studies using different subdimensions of the social dimension of CSR (e.g., community-related CSR measures and employee-related CSR measures) as well as in the case of studies using multiple subdimensions of the environmental dimension of CSR (e.g., measures of waste and measures of toxic waste). Apart from the moderator analysis pertaining to the specific dimension of CSR, we included both effect sizes in our analyses when a study reported correlations for both the environmental and the social dimension. This procedure is in line with other recent meta-analyses (Lander & Heugens, 2017; Mutlu et al., 2018) and is deemed to outperform procedures using only a single effect size according to Bijmolt and Pieters (2001). In cases where studies measured corporate social irresponsibility, such as environmental lawsuits (Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002) or the amount of carbon emissions (Haque, 2017), we converted the sign of the correlation.\n\nApart from the distinction between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR, we examine two country-level institutional factors as potential moderators. First, with regard to all relationships between board\n\n# Business & Society 00(0)\n\ncharacteristics and CSR, we explore the influence of shareholder protection strength. Therefore, we coded each study using the value of the investor protection index provided by the World Economic Forum (Schwab, 2018). The index ranges from 0 to 10, with higher index values indicating better shareholder protection, and comprises of three dimensions: (a) the extent to which there is transparency of related-party transactions, (b) the extent to which directors are held liable for self-dealing, and (c) the ease with which shareholders can sue for director misconduct. For single-country studies, we coded the index associated with that country. For studies covering multiple countries (i.e., six or fewer countries), we calculated the average index for those countries. Studies using large multicountry samples were excluded from this moderation analysis. This procedure follows Post and Byron (2015). With regard to the relationship between female representation on boards and CSR, we explore the potential moderating effect of a country-level measure of gender parity. We coded each study using the World Economic Forum’s (2018) gender gap index. This index ranges from 0 to 1 with higher index values indicating greater gender equality in terms of economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. In cases of multicountry samples, we follow the same procedure as we did for the shareholder protection index.\n\n# Meta-Analytic Procedures\n\nWe used the software Meta-essentials (Suurmond et al., 2017) and calculated random-effects models assuming the variability between effect sizes is due to sampling error in addition to the variability in the population (Lee et al., 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). In line with prior meta-analyses (Jeong & Harrison, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Lee & Madhavan, 2010) and following Hedges and Vevea (1998), correlations were first transformed using Fisher’s z transformation, because the sample correlation r is not an unbiased estimator of the population r (Dalton & Dalton, 2005; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). Z-transformed correlations have statistical properties of being approximately normally distributed. Furthermore, according to Geyskens and colleagues (2009), this procedure ensures an optimal weighting of effect sizes as the sample variance depends only on sample size and not on the population itself. We computed 95% confidence intervals to assess the significance of the mean effect sizes. A confidence interval that does not include zero indicates that the mean effect size is statistically significant (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). To test the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, we used Q statistics and I2 statistics. The Q statistic represents total dispersion in effect sizes and reflects the need to test moderators when it is significant (Allan et al., 2018; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). The I2 statistic refers to the amount of observed variance.\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\nthat is due to true differences among the studies, rather than error (Allan et al., 2018). Significant heterogeneity suggesting the presence of moderating effects is indicated when the Q statistic is significant and the I2 statistic suggests that there is a significant amount of variance attributed to true differences (i.e., I greater than 75%) (Allan et al., 2018)2.\n\nOne potential problem of meta-analysis is the file drawer problem, also called publication bias, which refers to circumstances in which “the research that appears in the published literature is systematically unrepresentative of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Economic Forum is an international organization that engages political, business, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas, including indices related to investor protection and gender parity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS & SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business & Society is a journal that publishes research on the relationship between business and society, including studies on corporate social responsibility (CSR).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENDRIKAT ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Endrikat et al. refers to a group of authors who conducted research related to meta-analytic procedures in the context of corporate social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KLD DATABASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) database is a source of data on corporate social responsibility, providing aggregate measures of CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDER GAP INDEX<|>EVENT<|>The Gender Gap Index is a measure provided by the World Economic Forum that assesses gender parity in various dimensions such as economic participation and political empowerment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION INDEX<|>EVENT<|>The Shareholder Protection Index is a measure provided by the World Economic Forum that evaluates the strength of shareholder protections in different countries.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM<|>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION INDEX<|>The World Economic Forum provides the Shareholder Protection Index, which assesses investor protection strength across countries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM<|>GENDER GAP INDEX<|>The World Economic Forum provides the Gender Gap Index, which measures gender equality across various dimensions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESS & SOCIETY<|>ENDRIKAT ET AL.<|>Endrikat et al. published research in the journal Business & Society, focusing on meta-analytic procedures related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KLD DATABASE<|>BUSINESS & SOCIETY<|>The KLD database is referenced in studies published in Business & Society, which analyze corporate social responsibility<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
