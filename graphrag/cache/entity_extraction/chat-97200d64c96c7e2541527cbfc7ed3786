Portfolio studies comprise of studies on long-short ESG portfolios and in particular studies on ESG mutual funds and indices.\n4. Two of the typical ways to treat missing data are model-based distribution estimation and the replacement of missing data (imputation) with estimated ones (Schafer and Graham 2002; Tsikriktsis 2005). The latter is applied due to the nonparametric nature of the data. We estimate the total number of missing net studies based on the subgroup means of overlaps in transparent vote-count studies, meta-analyses, and among both. The determined subgroup overlap means are applied to each subgroup of nontransparent studies.\n5. The method assumes simplistically comparable sample sizes for the underlying primary studies, which is rather the exception in research synthesis. It is also constructed as fixed effect model, which assumes that studies draw samples from a population with the same standardized mean difference (Hedges and Olkin 1980). The calculated effect size for the vote-count sample should therefore be seen as quick approximate estimate instead of a final analysis (Hedges and Olkin 1985).\n6. Please refer to table 1, p. 210 in Schmidt and Oh (2013) for a technical summary of the approach.\n7. The applied tests are Pettitt, SNHT, Buishand, and von Neumann. The null hypothesis of the tests verifies if a time series is homogenous between two randomly selected times within the time series. The different tests allow conclusions not only for an assumed normal distribution but also for nonparametric distributions. Only data previous to 1997 are assessed as nonhomogenous to later observations in 2 of 4 tests. The SNHT test detects significantly higher results before 1985. The Buishand test detects significantly higher results previous to 1997 at the .05 level.\n\n# References\n\nAguinis, Herman, Dan. R. Dalton, Frank A. Bosco, Charles A. Pierce, and Catherine M.
