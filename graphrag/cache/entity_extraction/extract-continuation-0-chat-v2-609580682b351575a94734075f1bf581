ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\n# Gunther Capelle-Blancard1 • Aurélien Petit2\n\nReceived: 24 March 2016 / Accepted: 8 August 2017\n\nÓ Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2017\n\n# Abstract\n\nStories about corporate social responsibility have become very frequent over the past decade, and managers can no longer ignore their impact on firm value. In this paper, we investigate the extent and the determinants of the stock market’s reaction following ordinary news related to environmental, social and governance issues—the so-called ESG factors. To that purpose, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Our empirical analysis is based on about 33,000 ESG news (positive or negative), targeting one hundred listed companies over the period 2002–2010. On average, firms facing negative events experience a drop in their market value of 0.1%, whereas companies gain nothing on average from positive announcements. We find also that market participants are responsive to the media, but they do not react to firms’ press releases or to NGOs’ disclosures. Moreover, our results indicate that sector’s reputation mitigates the loss (the goodwill hypothesis) and that cultural proximity and lexical contents of ESG disclosures play a significant role in the magnitude of the impact.\n\n# Electronic supplementary material\n\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10551-017-3667-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n# Keywords\n\nCorporate social responsibility, Socially responsible investing, ESG news, Disclosure, Event study\n\n# Introduction\n\n“Even the largest avalanche is triggered by small things.” Vernor Vinge1\n\nCompanies are used to coping, almost everyday, with one or several news concerning their social responsibility. Certainly, the debate on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and what should be the firm’s objective(s) is not settled. There are still lively controversies on this question (Portney 2008; Porter and Kramer 2011), but whatever the answer, evidence suggests that environmental, social or corporate governance concerns—the so-called ESG factors—may impact firm value and managers can no longer ignore this.\n\nRecent history provides many instances where bad corporate social responsibility caused huge economic and financial losses. Consider, for instance, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010: 3 months after the disaster, BP had lost half its share value, which represents tens of billions dollars (Smith et al. 2011). Some even reported that, given the size of the company, the oil spill impacted the UK economy as a whole. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 is a dramatic example too. Admittedly, the accident is the direct consequence of the Great East Japan Earthquake, but the extent of the accident is also related to governance failures by TEPCO, whose market value has collapsed (Kawashima and Takeda 2012;\n\n1 The Coming Technological Singularity, 1993.\n\nG. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit\n\nLopatta and Kaspereit 2014). Another recent example, albeit much less dramatic, is the Moncler scandal: in November 2014, after a television report showed geese being mistreated while being plucked by jacket makers, the market value of the Italian luxury outerwear company decreased by 6%.\n\nHowever, beyond anecdotal evidence, we know little about the impact of ESG news on firm value, on a day-to-day basis. Recently, two papers provide interesting insights.2 First, Krueger (2015) studies how stock markets react to positive and negative ESG events and provide evidence that investors respond strongly negatively to negative events and weakly negatively to positive events. Second, Aouadi and Marsat (2016) have investigated the relationship between ESG controversies and firm market value using a dataset of more than 3000 ESG controversies provided by Asset4 Thomson Reuters. They show that higher CSP score has an impact on market value (Tobin’s Q) only for high-attention firms, located in countries with greater press freedom, more searched on the Internet, more followed by analysts, and with an improved corporate social reputation. Thus, these findings provide new insights on the role of firm visibility through which firms can profit from their CSP. These results are appealing and, in this paper, we attempt to contribute to this burgeoning literature.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the stock market’s reaction to about 33,000 ESG news from 2002 to 2010 targeting one hundred multinational companies listed among the largest in the world. To that purpose, we use an original dataset provided by Covalence EthicalQuote, a Geneva-based firm specialized in ethical quotation.3 The large number of news allows us to perform a robust-event study. The Covalence classification is used to build a range of variables of interest, such as the type, the source or the region of occurrence of an event. First, we globally examine the direct impact of positive and negative ESG news on firms’ stock market capitalization and the consequences on shareholders’ wealth. Second, we seek to determine whether certain characteristics of the news or of the targeted firm affect this impact. Thanks to the wide spectrum of events, we are able to implement multidimensional regressions to determine the main drivers of abnormal returns and which features have a key impact.\n\nThe academic literature on the impact of ESG news is larger, but most of the papers assess the market reaction following a specific event, based on small hand-collected samples without much details. Consequently, they provide little evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or comparison between different events.\n\nRecently, Elayan et al. (2014) have also used data from Covalence EthicalQuote, but\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GUNTHER CAPELLE-BLANCARD<|>PERSON<|>Gunther Capelle-Blancard is one of the authors of the paper discussing the impact of ESG news on stock market reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURÉLIEN PETIT<|>PERSON<|>Aurélien Petit is a co-author of the paper that investigates the stock market's reaction to ESG news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVALENCE ETHICALQUOTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Covalence EthicalQuote is a Geneva-based firm that specializes in ethical quotation and provided the dataset used in the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL SPILL<|>EVENT<|>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was a significant environmental disaster in April 2010 that led to substantial financial losses for BP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI NUCLEAR DISASTER<|>EVENT<|>The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred in March 2011 as a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake, leading to governance failures by TEPCO and a collapse in market value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONCLER SCANDAL<|>EVENT<|>The Moncler scandal in November 2014 involved mistreatment of geese, resulting in a 6% decrease in the market value of the Italian luxury outerwear company.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUNTHER CAPELLE-BLANCARD<|>COVALENCE ETHICALQUOTE<|>Gunther Capelle-Blancard authored a paper that utilized data provided by Covalence EthicalQuote to analyze ESG news impact<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURÉLIEN PETIT<|>COVALENCE ETHICALQUOTE<|>Aurélien Petit co-authored a paper that used data from Covalence EthicalQuote to study the stock market's reaction to ESG news<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL SPILL<|>BP<|>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill caused BP to lose half its share value, significantly impacting the company's financial standing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI NUCLEAR DISASTER<|>TEPCO<|>The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster led to governance failures by TEPCO, resulting in a collapse of its market value<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONCLER SCANDAL<|>MONCLER<|>The Moncler scandal resulted in a 6% decrease in the market value of the Moncler company due to negative publicity<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
