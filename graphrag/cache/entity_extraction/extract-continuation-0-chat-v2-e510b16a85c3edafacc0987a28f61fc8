Panel C reports the time-series variables. MKTRF is the monthly return on the value-weighted stock market net of the risk free rate; HML is the monthly return on the portfolio long value stocks and short growth stocks; SMB is the monthly return on the portfolio long small-cap stocks and short large-cap stocks; MOM is the monthly return on the portfolio long 12-month stock winners and short 12-month past losers; CMA is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on conservative investment stocks and short on aggressive investment stocks; BAB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low-beta stocks and short on high-beta stocks; LIQ is the liquidity factor of Pastor and Stambaugh; NET ISSUANCE is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high-net-issuance stocks and short on low-net-issuance stocks. Net issuance for year t is the change in the natural log of split-adjusted shares outstanding from the fiscal yearend in t-2 to the fiscal yearend in t-1; IDIO VOL is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. Panel D reports the ownership variables. IOi,t is the fraction of the shares of company i held by institutions in the FactSet database at the end of year t. IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions at the end of the year, and then dividing this amount by shares outstanding at the end of the year. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership by insurance companies; IO_INVESTCOS is the ownership by investment companies (e.g., mutual funds); IO_ADVISERS is the ownership by independent investment advisers; IO_PENSIONS is the ownership by pension funds; IO_HFS is the ownership by hedge funds. PRINVi,t is the inverse of firm iâ€™s share price at the end of year t; TOT VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of daily stock returns for company i over the one-year period; VOLUMEi,t is the average daily trading volume (in $million) of stock i over the calendar year t; NASDAQi,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is listed on NASDAQ in year t, and zero otherwise; SP500i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is part of the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zero otherwise.\n\n# Panel A: Emission variables\n\n|Variable|Mean|Median|Std.
