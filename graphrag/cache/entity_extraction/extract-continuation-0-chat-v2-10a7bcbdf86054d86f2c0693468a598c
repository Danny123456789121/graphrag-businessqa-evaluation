The population correlations (rs) were calculated by means of random effects models. Conﬁdence intervals were calculated at the 95 % level. To assess the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, Q B statistics were calculated (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Subgroup analysis was used in order to examine potential moderation effects (Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The complete samples for both positive and negative events were divided into subgroups referring to potential moderation effects and calculated separate meta-analyses for these subgroups (King et al. 2004).\n\nFirst, the sample was split by distinguishing studies focusing on US firms and studies examining non-US firms. Although the majority of studies focused on US firms, scholars have recently begun to use samples drawn from other geographical regions (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012). Several factors which are likely to affect the market reactions to CEP-related events may originate from country-specific differences with regard to economic, social, legal, or political aspects. For instance, the level of a country’s economic development has been shown to determine the general degree and enforcement of environmental regulations (Dinda 2004; Grossman and Krueger 1995), which may influence the extent to which environmental issues constitute potential threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). Moreover, general attitudes concerning environmental issues that may affect investors’ reactions to CEP-related events strongly depend on national contexts (e.g., Baughn et al. 2007; Kilbourne et al. 2002).\n\nSecond, the studies were distinguished between studies examining events that occurred before the year 2000 and studies examining events that have occurred since the year 2000. Environmental issues have been gaining momentum throughout the last decades in both academic research and business practice. For example, Jermier et al. (2006) surveyed scholarly journals cataloged in the ABI/Inform Global database and observed an increase of more than 300 % in the number of publications related to the field of organizations and the natural environment from the period 1990–1994 to 2000–2004. Furthermore, from 1995 to 2012, the size of the US SRI market, measured in total.\n\nIn cases of sample periods involving years before and after the year 2000, the studies were coded according to the main emphasis of the sample period.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nassets under professional management, increased by 486 % (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment 2012). Given the significantly increased relevance of environmental issues, it is likely that the stock market reactions to CEP-related events have changed since the 1990s. The year 2000 was chosen for splitting the samples because the DJSIs, the first global sustainability equity indexes, were launched in September 1999.\n\nThird, the sample was divided according to whether the study explicitly mentioned that it accounted for confounding events or whether the study failed to do so. According to McWilliams and Siegel (1997), confounding events constitute the most critical issue with regard to the event study methodology. Confounding events are firm-specific events, other than the focal event, that occur during the event window and might have an impact on the firm’s stock price. Such events can include dividend declarations, announcements of an impending merger, signings of major contracts, announcements of new products, filings of large damage suits, announcements of unexpected earnings, or changes with regard to key executive positions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Concerns regarding confounding events can be addressed by screening for potentially confounding events and excluding the relevant observations from the analysis.\n\nFinally, this work distinguished between effect sizes derived from ARs and effect sizes derived from CARs. ARs represent the difference between expected returns and actual returns, or in other words, returns earned by firms adjusted for the “normal” return process (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). ARs are usually measured on day zero (i.e., the date of the respective event) or on day 1 (i.e., the day following the respective event). CARs are calculated by cumulating ARs over a certain period of time, the so-called event window. Thus, CARs are assumed to measure the average effect of an event on the firm’s stock price (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). However, the use of CARs may exacerbate the problem of confounding events, especially if long event windows are used (McWilliams and Siegel 1997).
