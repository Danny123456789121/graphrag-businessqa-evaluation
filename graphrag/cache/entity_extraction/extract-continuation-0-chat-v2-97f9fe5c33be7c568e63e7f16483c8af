The difference between both groups is highly significant (Table 5). These conclusions are supported when the first-level meta-analytical results in the transparent primary studies are deconstructed. The differences in correlations are not so pronounced, nonetheless significant (Table 5). This distinct deviation of portfolio and nonportfolio findings is examined in more detail in the “Discussion” section.\n\n# Table 5.\n\nEffect size in dependence of portfolio and nonportfolio samples.\n\n|Number of review analyses|N|Effect size|Effect size value|powerα = 0.05|Non-p and p difference|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|30|1.578|rv(non−p)|0.177***|0.999|.238***|\n|5|238|rv(p)|–0.061*|0.154| |\n|–|471|^i(non−p) r|0.131***|0.815|.076**|\n|–|80|^i(non−p) ^i(p) r|0.055**|0.078| |\n|–|471|p|0.183***|0.981|.089**|\n|–|80|p^i(p)|0.094***|0.132| |\n\nThis table deconstructs the results in Table 4 for rv= (p), , and i in nonportfolio studies effect sizes (non-p) and portfolio studies effect sizes (p). Power0.05 is Cohen’s power with α = 0.05 and for the corresponding sample and effect size. The difference of portfolio and nonportfolio studies in effect sizes is tested for significance. The significance thresholds for p-values are *p < .10, **p < .05, and ***p < .01.\n\n# Sub-effects in asset classes\n\nAside from the overall distribution of results and correlation factors in vote-count studies and meta-analyses, the data allow for examinations of differences in asset classes (D’Antonio, Johnsen, and Hutton 1997; Bhojraj and Sengupta 2003; Eichholtz, Kok, and Quigley 2010) – although with limited availability of nonequity classes. In a sub-sample consisting of 751 gross and 334 net studies within the vote-count sample 87.1% analyze equity-linked relations.\n\nIn contrast, nonequity asset classes both for bonds and real estate display a considerably higher share of positive findings over equities. More than two-thirds of studies uncover significant positive performance relations to ESG criteria. The share of positive votes for the 36 analyzed bond studies stands at 63.9% – with 13 neutral or mixed findings (36.1%). The relatively young research field of green real estate studies is reflected with seven studies in the total sample. Five studies (71.4%) find a positive and the other two a neutral relation (Figure 5).\n\n# Sub-effects in ESG categories\n\nA key question is whether any of the three ESG letters may have a dominating effect on CFP. Some meta-analyses find significant positive relations for corporate environmental performance and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014). Human capital-focused meta-analyses (Combs et al. 2006; Crook et al. 2011; Rosenbusch, Brinckmann, and Bausch 2011) also find highly significant positive correlations. Various review studies on multifaceted corporate governance aspects and its relation to CFP exist and also support a positive relation (Dalton et al. 1999; Gillan and Starks 2007; Love 2010). However, not all of the E-, S-, and G-specific findings are free from ambiguity and no large-scale comparison between the subgroups has been undertaken yet.\n\nFor our sample of vote-count studies with identifiable ESG categories in 644 studies, we determine a relatively even positive relation for E, S, and G. The highest proportion is found in G with 62.3% of all cases. Governance-related aspects, on the other hand, demonstrate also the highest percentage of negative correlations with 9.2%. If the share of negative findings is deducted from positive ones, environmental studies offer the most favorable relation (58.7–4.3%). Studies with a social focus show 55.1% (5.1%) positive (negative) outcomes, hence the weakest relation.\n\n|Equities|Bonds|Real Estate|\n|---|---|---|\n|0.0%|63.9%|71.4%|\n|4.4%|0.0%|0.0%|\n\nFigure 5.
