Based on (short-term) shareholder maximization logic, this perspective contends that environmental activities conflict with firms’ primary objectives, as the voluntary reduction of environmental impacts is considered philanthropy, which incurs social costs and contravenes profit-maximization (King & Lenox, 2002). These neoclassical positions have been increasingly challenged by various scholars who have provided explanations for a positive impact of CEP on CFP leading to a “win–win” situation (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). The most important theoretical frameworks along these lines are the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) and the instrumental stakeholder theory.\n\nIntroduced by Hart (1995), the NRBV extends the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984) by integrating the natural environment into this framework. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities, leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan, 2005; Hart & Dowell, 2011). The NRBV argues that there are three key strategic capabilities, each building upon different key resources and each providing different sources of competitive advantage: pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development (Hart, 1995; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Pollution prevention, for example, can save costs of installing and operating end of pipe technologies and may reduce material and waste disposal costs, and decreases compliance and liability costs (Hart & Ahuja, 1996; King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Because the RBV emphasizes the interconnectedness of resources and capabilities, competitive advantage and improved CFP may not result from single resources, but from rather complex resource bundles (Hart & Dowell, 2011; Hoskisson, Hitt, Wan, & Yiu, 1999). Consequently, there are several mechanisms through which CEP may translate into CFP. For example, the adoption of environmental technologies and the implementation of an environmental policy can stimulate process innovations that may increase the efficiency of production processes (Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998; Surroca et al., 2010). A proactive environmental strategy may also foster organizational learning and advanced human resources practices that may increase employee skills and involvement (Hart, 1995; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Waldman, Siegel, & Javidan, 2006; Weber, 2008). Furthermore, high levels of CEP can improve reputation (Brammer & Pavelin, 2004; Hart, 1995; Surroca et al., 2010), which may increase a firm’s attractiveness as an employer and thus provides potential competitive advantages (Turban & Greening, 1996). Environmental activities can also lead to fundamental and beneficial changes with regard to decision-making processes and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman & Keim, 2001; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Hence, the reasoning of the NRBV allows a systematic examination of the CEP–CFP link by providing a rationale as to why proactive environmental strategies and management practices may constitute sources of competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Hart & Dowell, 2011).\n\nInstrumental stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Jones, 1995) provides another theoretical perspective from which a positive impact of CEP on CFP can be explained. As responsible behavior towards the natural environment constitutes an essential part of the stakeholder expectations firms are faced with, CEP can be viewed as an attempt to meet these expectations (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003). Instrumental stakeholder theory argues that meeting the claims of key stakeholders (e.g., claims for improved CEP) contributes to superior CFP. Through successful stakeholder management and the satisfaction of stakeholder demands, firms may acquire several sources of competitive advantage, such as reputation, long-term relationships with suppliers and customers, or increased efficiency in its adaptation to external demands in general (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Hillman & Keim, 2001; Lankoski, 2008; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010). For example, firms with superior CEP can increase their sales due to customer’s willingness to pay premium prices for products of environmentally responsive firms (Hart & Dowell, 2011; Hillman & Keim, 2001). Furthermore, CEP may lead to improved investor relations and thus may lower market risk (Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Sharfman & Fernando, 2008) and the cost of financial capital (Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; Lankoski, 2008).\n\nIn line with other scholars (e.g., Hart & Dowell, 2011; Russo & Minto, 2012; Surroca et al., 2010) we argue that instrumental stakeholder theory and the NRBV should not be considered as competing or disparate frameworks but as complementary approaches. First, a firm’s ability to encourage stakeholder integration can be considered an organizational capability (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Second, successful stakeholder management allows firms to access and capitalize on tangible and intangible resources (Russo &\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
