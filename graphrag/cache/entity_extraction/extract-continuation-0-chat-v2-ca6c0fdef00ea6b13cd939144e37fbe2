The more unstable behavior of this version of the indicator does not affect the results. The Greenium remains negative and highly significant with the benchmark factor fg,t as well as with f g,t and f g,t (Rob 3.1 - 3.3). The Greenium is still negative on the larger sample considering all the three alternatives for the construction of the factor. However, significance is lower in Rob. 4.2 and Rob. 4.3, while the estimate in Rob. 4.1 is not significant.\n\nOverall, the Greenium remains negative and significant across the majority of the several robustness checks. It tends to loses statistical significance mostly in extreme cases, when we only consider one of the two components of the synthetic greenness and transparency indicator.\n\n20\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n**Table 5: The table reports results for robustness checks Rob. 1.1 - Rob 2.3.
