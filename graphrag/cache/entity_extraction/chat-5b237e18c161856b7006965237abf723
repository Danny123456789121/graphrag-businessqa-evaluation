Hierarchal Structure of Corporate Sustainability\n\n# 4.3. The Prioritizing of Sub-Attributes\n\nThe ranking of sub-attributes of corporate sustainability is presented in Figures 7–15.\n\nGovernance sub-attributes: We identified the sub-attributes ranking (GOV) as following:\n\nGOV4 > GOV1 > GOV3 > GOV7 > GOV5 > GOV2 > GOV6. Management and audit of corporate governance\n\n(GOV4) obtained the highest score (0.4132) and is considered the main influencing sub-attribute of its category. The outcome proved that face validity is an accurate justification as audit expertise, then skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nSkilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses must address governance and strengthening it since governance is responsible for guiding companies towards sustainability. Another high score observed with sub-criteria in this category is the corporate governance report (GOV1), with a weight of 0.3884. Corporate award and recognition (GOV3) showed a score of 0.3732, standing at the top-three most important sub-criteria of this category (as seen in Figure 7). Investors are evaluating both economic and financial returns on investments (ROI), but the valuation of investees' reputation is increasing. Then, reputation is positively influenced by corporate sustainability governance at high standards (Gottschalk, 2011). Public Private Partnership on sustainability (GOV7) received a score of 0.2351, putting this sub-attribute at the fourth position of most important sub-attributes. Moreover, corporate governance accountability (GOV5) showed a score of 0.1717, being the fifth most important sub-attribute in this category. The structure and dynamics of corporate governance (GOV2) and conduct and conflict of interest in corporate governance (GOV6) are the least influencing sub-criteria, obtaining the weights of 0.1653 and 0.1089, respectively. The decision for a given company for engaging corporate sustainability governance depends on the achievements of the corporate goals. In this way, [97] underlined that a company’s sustainability is influenced by the stakeholder’s sustainability. Additionally, relations with stakeholders must be considered key for decision-making processes which, in turn, support the establishment of corporate strategies.\n\n|Conflict of interest in corporate governance-GOV6|0.1089|\n|---|---|\n|Structure and dynamics of corporate governance-GOV2|0.1653|\n|Corporate governance accountability-GOV5|0.1717|\n|Public Private Partnership on sustainability-GOV7|0.2351|\n|Corporate award and recognition-GOV3|0.3732|\n|Corporate governance report-GOV1|0.3884|\n|Management and audit of corporate governance-GOV4|0.4132|\n\nFigure 7. Governance Sub-criteria.\n\n# Product Responsibility\n\nUnder the Product responsibility (PR) category, we obtained the following sub-criteria ranking: PR4>PR3>PR5>PR2>PR1, as presented in Figure 8. Product research and development (PR4) is seen as a challenge in supporting the development of corporate sustainability infrastructure, with a score of 0.4102. The next sub-criteria that received the highest score is the compliance with products and policies (PR3) category, with a weight of 0.3297. Product complaint mechanism (PR5) received a score of 0.1737, being the third most important sub-criteria. Following this, indirect impacts of the product (PR2) reached the fourth position (within Product Responsibility category) with a weight of 0.1321. The fifth most important sub-attribute came from the personal impacts of product use (PR1) with a weight of 0.0952. Then, the first phases of product-innovation processes, as well as decision-making processes, must address a sustainability perspective in order to introduce a sustainability paradigm into the business’s practices. Additionally, organizations must incorporate a long-term perspective when considering sustainability as a strategic asset for businesses [98].\n\n# Transparency and Communication\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107. Transparency of general reports (TC4) reached the first position in the Transparency and Communication category, showing a score of 0.4321. Moreover, strategic perspectives after transparency of general reports (TC3) is in the second position, reaching a score of 0.3487. Following, commitments to the community (TC1) and alignment of commitments (TC2) are ranked at the third and fourth.\n\n# Personal impacts of product use-PR I\n\n0.0952\n\n# Indirect impacts of product-PR2\n\n0.1321\n\n# Product complaint mechanism-PRS\n\n0.2575\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n17 of 29\n\n# Compliance with products and policies-PR3\n\n0.3297\n\npositions, obtaining a score of 0.2175 and 0.1564, respectively. Finally, ethics and citizenship (TC5) are considered the least influencing sub-criteria with a score of 0.1324. Thus, sustainability supports knowledge creation and sharing, which, in turn, eases communication within organizations. To make a proactive sustainability strategy realistic,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
