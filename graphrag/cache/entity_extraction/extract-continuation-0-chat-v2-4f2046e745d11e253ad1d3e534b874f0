In this case, however, there is a significant difference between the two subgroups, with accounting measures showing a stronger relationship (Q B = 3.869, p = 0.049). This result supposes a stronger bidirectional relationship for accounting measures and might explain the findings of earlier meta-analyses, which suggested that the relationship is stronger when accounting measures are used (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Margolis et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the latter results are not to be used to draw a conclusion on the causal relationship between CP and CFP.\n\nOperationalization of CP Just as with the measure of the CFP variable, the indicator representing CP was expected to have an impact on the CP–CFP relationship. It was questioned whether the positive relationship would hold for the use of a donation dummy, the absolute donation amount, or the relative donation amount as a CP measure (RQ3b).
