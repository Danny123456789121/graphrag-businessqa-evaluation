With the acceleration in technical automation potential that generative AI enables, our scenarios for automation adoption have correspondingly accelerated. These scenarios encompass a wide range of outcomes, given that the pace at which solutions will be developed and adopted will vary based on decisions that will be made on investments.\n\ndeployment, and regulation, among other factors. But they give an indication of the degree to which the activities that workers do each day may shift.\n\nAs an example of how this might play out in a specific occupation, consider postsecondary English language and literature teachers, whose detailed work activities include preparing tests and evaluating student work. With generative AI’s enhanced natural-language capabilities, more of these activities could be done by machines, perhaps initially to create a first draft that is edited by teachers but perhaps eventually with far less human editing required. This could free up time for these teachers to spend more time on other work activities, such as guiding class discussions or tutoring students who need extra assistance.\n\nOur previously modeled adoption scenarios suggested that 50 percent of time spent on 2016 work activities would be automated sometime between 2035 and 2070, with a midpoint scenario around 2053. Our updated adoption scenarios, which account for developments in generative AI, models the time spent on 2023 work activities reaching 50 percent automation between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint of 2045—an acceleration of roughly a decade compared with the previous estimate (Exhibit 8).13\n\n# Exhibit 8\n\nThe midpoint scenario at which automation adoption could reach 50 percent of time spent on current work activities has accelerated by a decade.\n\n|Global automation of time spent on current work activities,1 %| |\n|---|---|\n|100|Updated early scenario including generative AI2|\n|80|Updated late scenario including generative AI3|\n|60|Midpoint 2017|\n|50%| |\n|40|Midpoint updated|\n|20| |\n|0| |\n|2020| |\n|2030| |\n|2040| |\n|2050| |\n|2060| |\n|2070| |\n|2080| |\n|2090| |\n\n1Includes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world. 2017 estimates are based on the activity and occupation mix from 2016.

Even if the potential for technology to automate a particular work activity is high, the costs required to do so have to be compared with the cost of human wages. In countries such as China, India, and Mexico, where wage rates are lower, automation adoption is modeled to arrive more slowly than in higher-wage countries (Exhibit 9).\n\n# Exhibit 9\n\nAutomation adoption is likely to be faster in developed economies, where higher wages will make it economically feasible sooner.\n\n|Automation adoption by scenario for select countries, %|United States|Germany|Japan|France|China|Mexico|India|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Early scenario¹|100|100|100|100|100|100|100|\n|Late scenario²|80|80|80|80|80|80|80|\n| |60|60|60|60|60|60|60|\n| |50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|\n| |40|40|40|40|40|40|40|\n| |20|20|20|20|20|20|20|\n| |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|\n\n¹ Early scenario: aggressive scenario for all key model parameters (technical automation potential, integration timelines, economic feasibility, and technology diffusion rates).\n\n² Late scenario: parameters are set for the later adoption potential.\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nOur analyses of generative AI’s impact on work activities and the pace of automation adoption rely on several assumptions and sensitivities (see Box 4, “Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities”).\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Box 4\n\n# Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities\n\nThis analysis considers the potential for developing automation technologies. It focuses on the role of small and midsize enterprises around the world, in addition to the challenges of incorporating and managing change in larger organizations. This analysis considers automation only of current work activities and occupations. It does not account for how those work activities may shift over time or forecast new activities and occupations.1 Also, the analysis accounts solely for first-order effects. It does not take into account how labor rates could change, and it does not model changes in labor force participation rates or other general equilibrium effects.\n\nThat said, while these models account for the time it may take for technology to be adopted across an economy, technologies could be adopted much more rapidly in an individual organization. Other research may reach different conclusions. The technology adoption curves are based on historical findings that technologies take eight to 27 years from commercial availability to reach\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey Global Institute is a research organization that analyzes economic trends and the impact of technologies like generative AI on productivity and labor markets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that provides insights and analysis on various economic and business issues, including the potential of generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can create content, automate tasks, and enhance productivity across various sectors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country where automation adoption is modeled to arrive more slowly due to lower wage rates compared to developed countries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where automation adoption is expected to be slower due to lower wage rates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEXICO<|>GEO<|>Mexico is a country where automation adoption is modeled to be slower because of its lower wage rates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a developed country where automation adoption is likely to be faster due to higher wages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is a developed country where automation adoption is expected to be rapid due to higher wages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is a developed country that is likely to adopt automation technologies quickly due to higher wages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is a developed country where automation adoption is expected to be faster due to higher wages.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>McKinsey Global Institute analyzes the economic potential and impact of generative AI on productivity and labor markets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>McKinsey & Company provides insights and analysis on the potential of generative AI in various sectors<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The United States is likely to adopt generative AI technologies faster due to higher wages<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMANY<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Germany is expected to adopt generative AI technologies quickly due to higher wages<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPAN<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Japan is likely to adopt generative AI technologies rapidly due to higher wages<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>France is expected to adopt generative AI technologies faster due to higher wages<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>China's lower wage rates are expected to slow down the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>India's lower wage rates are expected to result in slower adoption of generative AI technologies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEXICO<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>Mexico's lower wage rates are expected to delay the adoption of generative AI technologies<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
