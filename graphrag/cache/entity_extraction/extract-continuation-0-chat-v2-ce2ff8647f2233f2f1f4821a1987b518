Moreover, initiatives to reduce energy consumption (ECS1) is located at the second position with a score of 0.4646. The third and fourth sub-criteria within the energy consumption and saving category are energy use efficiency (ECS4) and energy saving policies (ECS3), which received weights of 0.4520 and 0.3752, respectively.\n\nInvestments in renewable energy projects lead to greater engagement by the local community related to renewable energy development. Thus, renewable energy projects can empower the community and enrich their social capital. In addition, an expected outcome is an increase in energy efficiency within a community and reducing energy costs. Organizations can improve sustainability by reducing material waste, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.\n\n# Energy saving policies-ECS3\n\n0.3752\n\n# Energy use efficiency-ECS4\n\n0.452\n\n# Energy Consumption and Caving\n\nFigure 15 presents the ranking of sub-criteria related to Energy Consumption and Caving to develop corporate sustainability as follows: ECS2>ECS1>ECS4>ECS3, with consistency ratio 0.0140.
