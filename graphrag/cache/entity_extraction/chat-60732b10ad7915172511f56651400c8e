The resulting analysis approximates the potential value of generative AI and foundation models in terms of productivity, or the equivalent amount by which the technologies could reduce the global functional spending required to maintain current revenue levels.\n\n# Summary of our approach\n\nOur micro-to-macro use-case-based approach to estimating the potential impact of generative AI included the following:\n\nHow we estimated the impact of generative AI across industries. We identified and cataloged generative AI and foundation model use cases with input from experts from McKinsey’s industry and functional practices. While the resulting generative AI and foundation model use case database is not necessarily exhaustive, it was meant to be as comprehensive as possible.\n\n# Business function overview\n\n|Business function|Definition|\n|---|---|\n|Customer operations|Activities related to customer care, such as call centers|\n|Software development|Activities related to designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software programs, applications, and systems, such as enterprise resource planning tools and other internal tools, that meet specific business or customer needs|\n|Product R&D|Activities related to new products or services, such as market and academic research, ideation, and simulations used in the early stages of product development, and heavy simulations, prototyping, and testing used later in the development process|\n|Legal, risk, and compliance|Activities related to risk and compliance, such as labor relations, litigation support, and contract creation|\n\n1 The AI Index 2023 annual report, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, April 2023.\n\n# Activities related to B2B and B2C marketing, for example,\n\n# Marketing and sales\n\nmarket research, creative, marketing strategy, and sales, customer preparation, and interaction support, including pricing analytical support, price scraping, and item matching\n\n# IT\n\nActivities related to internal information tech systems, such as administrative and IT help desk, but excluding software engineering for internal solutions (captured within software engineering)\n\n# Talent and organization (including HR)\n\nActivities related to organizational performance and talent management; for example, organizational health assessment, recruiting, learning and development, and human resources\n\n# Finance and strategy\n\nActivities related to financial operations, such as general accounting, financial planning and analysis, and accounts payable and receivable, as well as internal strategy functions such as market intelligence and strategic planning\n\n# Estimate generative AI’s impact in individual use cases.\n\nWe collected expert inputs, the results of McKinsey internal experiments, and published research to estimate the potential quantitative range of impact (in both cost savings and revenue uplift) and to gain qualitative findings from functions within individual use cases. Where generative AI and foundation models are assumed to increase revenue, we recast the effect as an increase in productivity that would be the equivalent of the reduced level of spending required to maintain the same level of output (thus enabling comparability with cost reductions).\n\nOur analysis of use cases only examines the direct impact of generative AI on productivity. They do not incorporate secondary benefits, such as the economic impact of hiring a more capable employee or hiring employees more rapidly.\n\n# Estimate the impact across industries\n\nTo estimate the impact of generative AI and foundation models across industries, we scaled our analysis from a functional lens to an industry lens for each industry, assessing the weight of functional costs. For instance, customer operations costs are higher in the telecom industry than in aerospace.\n\nFor each use case, the relevant costs were defined to account only for activities for which generative AI or foundation models were likely to deliver productivity gains. For example, the cost base against which we assessed productivity gains for the marketing function excludes ad buying costs because the use cases we assessed for generative AI in that function would have no productivity impact on the “ad buying” activity.\n\n# A.\n\nGlobal revenues for each industry in 2022 were sourced from IHS Markit and Oxford Economics.\n\n# B.\n\nWe estimated the functional cost for a function as a percentage of total revenue in an industry based on published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.\n\n2  Generative AI at work, April 2023.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nC. For each function, we estimated the relevant costs (considering only underlying activities affected by our use cases) as a portion of overall spending on a function, again informed by published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.\n\nD. For each use case, we quantified the potential impact of generative AI and foundation models based on the impact (either cost or revenue) as a function of the relevant addressable spending.\n\nE. We then calculated the impact by industry by aggregating the technology’s impact on use cases in an industry across functions.\n\n# Limitations of our impact analysis\n\nFor each use case, our analysis of the impact of generative AI and foundation models draws a conservative base case and a more accelerated upside potential. The estimates are based on existing data and experiences, and these estimates could be updated over time. Additionally, the list of use cases is not exhaustive but is as comprehensive as possible, given our methods.\n\nThe estimates in this report should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the nature of the technology and the wide range of uncertainty involved in the future development of generative AI. We welcome challenges to our analysis as well as additional inputs that would refine and enhance it.\n\n# Comparison with the 2018 report\n\n# Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning\n\nTo estimate the incremental impact that generative AI and foundation models could have in comparison to the value of artificial intelligence overall, we updated our 2018 estimates of the value that could be created through deployment of advanced analytics and previous generations of artificial intelligence.\n\nThis research incorporates 2022 updates to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
