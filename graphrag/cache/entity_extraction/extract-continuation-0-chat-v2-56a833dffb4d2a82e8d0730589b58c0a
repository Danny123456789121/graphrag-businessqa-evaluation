Therefore, future research is necessary to investigate the extent to which widespread GAI adoption may affect quality of life.\n\nIn this study, much of our discussion was primarily focused on the short-term, immediate applications of GAI adoption. However, the extent to which GAI applications can contribute to the corporate social responsibility efforts of HT stakeholders requires further attention and investigation. GAI’s role in enhancing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in HT firms and beyond needs to be analyzed and discussed in future research. ESG and various sustainability, societal marketing, and corporate social responsibility issues demand a long-term view (Dogru et al., 2022). Therefore, the extent to which HT firms can utilize GAI as a practical tool to enhance long-term welfare and social good for customers and other stakeholders, is one of the most important avenues for future research.\n\nEmpirical investigations of the effects of GAI on the HT industry will shed more light on the practical and policy implications of GAI adoption. Utilizing stakeholder theory, disruptive innovation theory, Leader-Member-Exchange theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and so on, future studies should develop GAI-specific scales, operationalize the constructs, collect data, and empirically and extensively.\n\n# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)\n\nAnalyze the effect of GAI on HT stakeholders. Specifically, future research is needed to investigate the value of GAI-enabled experiences and to examine whether an optimum level of GAI-enabled experience exists that provides a higher level of satisfaction for consumers, employees, and other stakeholders. Also, the effect of GAI applications might be different across different service segments in the HT domain. While GAI might be well perceived and needed in economy scale hotels or fast-food restaurants, luxury hotel guests and fine dining restaurant patrons might seek more human interaction. Indeed, luxury in the future could include the ability to interact with humans versus GAI only. As former Loews Hotels President and CEO Kinsell (2022) once stated, “Service comes from a manual; hospitality comes from the heart.” This noble expression provokes an important question in this new age: Can technology, like GAI, even without heartbeats, deliver heartfelt hospitality? This important question should be investigated in a comprehensive manner utilizing qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. Also, analyzing the problems that such adoption may cause to HT stakeholders will be necessary as companies start adopting GAI extensively in the HT industry.\n\nTo further explore the potential benefits of GAI for HT firms, future studies need to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of investing in the GAI ecosystem and to test whether GAI-related platforms help achieve better financial gains. Future research needs to delve into the economic aspects of the implementation of GAI in companies and assess the actual impacts of GAI on companies’ revenue, costs, productivity, and competitiveness. There are also risks associated with GAI, including data breaches, bias, discriminatory behavior, and the potential for decreased human interaction. Hence, the risk component of GAI can be evaluated in future research endeavors to see the best ways to mitigate these risks and create corresponding strategies. Although ethical and legal implications have been discussed in detail in this study, context-specific ethical and legal implications of GAI, such as privacy, security transparency, accountability, biases and stereotyping, and intellectual property rights, are the key areas to be analyzed further.\n\nGAI has important implications for HT research and education as well; however, for GAI initiatives to be successfully implemented in creating value for stakeholders, HT research and education institutions need to strategically integrate GAI as an aiding tool for research, teaching, and education, by developing clear policies and guidelines for scholars, educators, and students in utilizing GAI. Further research is necessary to investigate the implications of GAI for research and higher education in HT.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThe leading four authors reviewed, sorted, aggregated, and interpreted the contribution of the 26 other authors, extended the content, developed the conceptual model, and revised the manuscript addressing the anonymous reviewers’ and editors’ feedback and comments.
