We find that, during the first few years of the scheme, firms that received free carbon emission allowances on average significantly outperformed firms that did not. This suggests the presence of a large and statistically significant “carbon premium,” which is mainly explained by the higher cash flows due to the free allocation of carbon emission allowances. A carbon risk factor can also explain part of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns as firms with high carbon emissions have higher exposure to carbon risk and exhibit higher expected returns.\n\n# Keywords\n\nEuropean Union Emissions Trading Scheme; Carbon Emission Allowances; Carbon Risk; Stock Returns.\n\n# JEL Classification\n\nG12; G18; Q58.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThis paper is forthcoming in the Journal of Banking and Finance.

The EU ETS has created a new financial market for trading carbon emission allowances that give firms the right to emit carbon dioxide. During the initial two phases of the scheme, beginning in 2005 and ending in 2012, carbon emission allowances were granted to European firms predominantly free of charge. Firms that chose to pollute more than the allowances they received had to purchase extra allowances in the open market from firms that used less allowances than they received. This has led to the emergence of the largest multinational carbon market in the world (World Bank, 2014).\n\nThis paper is at the cross-section of environmental economics and finance. As the emergence of the European carbon market is a recent phenomenon, there is little work on how environmental regulation on carbon emissions can affect the financial performance of firms. This paper fills this gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical investigation of the effect of the EU ETS on stock returns. Our empirical analysis uses data on monthly stock returns from Germany as well as manually collected data on the number of carbon emission allowances received by each firm in the sample. We focus on Germany because it is by far the largest national market for carbon emissions and accounts for a quarter of Europe’s total carbon emissions. For robustness, we also examine data from the UK.\n\nTo be more specific, the main question of our empirical analysis is the following: did the free allocation of carbon emission allowances during the initial two phases of the EU ETS generate a “carbon premium” in stock returns? We address this question empirically by designing three carbon portfolios: the “dirty”, “medium” and “clean” portfolios. The dirty portfolio is a portfolio of firms that received a high number of free carbon emission allowances, the medium portfolio comprises firms that received a lower number of free allowances, and the clean portfolio includes all firms in the sample that did not receive any allowances. We then define the carbon premium as the abnormal excess return (alpha) of the “dirty-minus-clean” portfolio, which is assessed relative to the CAPM, the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model and the Carhart (1997) four-factor model.\n\nOur empirical analysis relies on an economic mechanism that attributes the carbon premium to two effects: the cash flow effect and the “carbon risk” effect. In terms of the cash flow effect, we show that the free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant\n\n1\n\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nproÖts to carbon emitting Örms. We use the framework of Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) to demonstrate that a cap-and-trade system increases the marginal cost of production since the free carbon allowances constitute an opportunity cost to the Örm. Firms tend to respond to the higher marginal cost by increasing output prices, reducing production so that less carbon allowances are used up, switching to less carbon-intensive production technologies or a combination of these options. This is the primary mechanism that justiÖes the carbon premium as it implies that the free allocation of carbon allowances can lead to large windfall Örm proÖts.\n\nThere is also a secondary mechanism that explains the carbon premium based on the carbon risk e§ect.
