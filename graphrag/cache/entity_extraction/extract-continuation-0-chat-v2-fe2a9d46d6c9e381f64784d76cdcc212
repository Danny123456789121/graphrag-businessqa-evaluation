The strategic aspect—practising and introducing Sustainable HRM to the company’s strategy.\n\nIn the evaluation of all statements, except for statement 2, the variants with the answer “yes” dominated (from 65 to 85% of responses). The evaluation of statements 4 and 6 concerning the consciousness aspect was higher than the others, as evidenced by a very high value of skewness coefficients as well as a median and a mode of 6.\n\nWhen assessing the activities related to the implementation of Sustainable HRM into the company’s strategy, the majority of respondents declared that they were undertaken in terms of statements 1, 3, and 5. The median in each of them was 5, i.e., half of the respondents indicated at least the answer “rather yes”. However, the detailed distribution of answer variants differed. The most frequently chosen variant in statement 1 was “yes”, in statement 5 “rather yes”, and in statement 3 the distribution of answers was bimodal—the most common answers were “rather yes” and “yes”.\n\nThe weakest asymmetry of the distribution and the lowest median were observed in the assessment of statement 2 (introducing sustainability into the company’s action plan). The median was 4, and affirmative answers were slightly less than half of the total (48%). At the same time, a high percentage (21%) of respondents had a problem with an unambiguous assessment of this statement, thus selecting the middle value on the scale.\n\n# 3.2.
