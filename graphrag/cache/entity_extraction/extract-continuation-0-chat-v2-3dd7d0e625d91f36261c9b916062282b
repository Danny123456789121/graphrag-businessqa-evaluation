Although it is a bit too early to see more publications now, a number of events associated with main stream finance journals in the last couple of years will surely link to relevant outputs (e.g. 2018 RFS Climate Finance Initiative in London3). Lacking of relevant research also means potentially high impact with ground-breaking research in this area. Overall, we are very positive to make the claim that an opportunity exists.\n\n# 3.2 Authors’ country of origin\n\nIt is also worth exploring where the keenness on green finance research mainly comes from. We look at this issue by linking it to the authors’ countries of origin. Figure 2 summarizes the information of country of origin of the authors. It depicts a clear picture showing that the main contributors to the recent fast progress of this field are mainly from the US, Europe and a few other developed countries. It is not surprising to see the dominance of US-based researchers in this field, as the World Bank, UN and many other most influential international organizations have their headquarters based in the US, which can much facilitate and encourage relevant research. For years, Europe has been the most enthusiastic promoter of global cooperation on climate change. Its world’s largest carbon trading market (EU ETS) with a long history has attracted substantial attentions from academic researchers.\n\n2 https://www.reuters.com/article/greenbonds-issuance/global-green-bond-issuance-hit-record-155-5-billion-in-2017-data-idUSL8N1P5335\n\n3 http://rfssfs.org/rfs-climate-finance-initiative/\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\non green energy issues. The color in the figure also demonstrates time dimension. The lighter the color is, the earlier the work appears. It is observed that this subject is piloted and led by researchers from the US and England, while the majority of studies from other regions follow up and appear later.\n\n(Insert Figure 2 here)\n\nAmong all visible contributors’ origins in the graph, China and India are the only two emerging economies. Considering the sizes of these two countries and their shares of global GHG emissions, it is very important to have China and India actively participating in the debates. The unbalanced distribution between developed and developing countries of origin may also imply that developed countries remain dominating on green finance topics. In the international negotiations on climate agreements, developing countries have been playing an increasingly important role. This is argued to be one of the main reasons that a universal agreement is difficult to reach (Costantini et al., 2016).\n\nAlthough developed countries are mainly the source of financing, without active cooperation from developing countries, it is hard to achieve efficient green financing or investment. Further investigations and understanding on developing economies and their status quo are very necessary.\n\nOf course, we have to acknowledge that academic research has been dominated by developed economies and author structure is unlikely to change much in a short period of time. Issues in developing countries however, should be one of the main future directions of research.\n\n# 3.3 Keywords analysis\n\nTable 2 lists the top ten keywords. Climate Finance, Climate Change and Policy are the top three main.\n\nPage 9 of 20\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nconcerns in the literature. The objective of developing green finance is to cope with climate change and this is clearly a policy relevant question.\n\n(Insert Table 2 here)\n\nFigure 3 provides a graphical illustration of keywords appearing in these articles. The graphical information combined with the world top ten list reveals some interesting patterns. In addition to the core issues, a number of keywords are shown to have attracted much attention. For example, Management is ranked the 10th, which reflects the concerns on how green finance is managed by a state or in a market. Another relevant keyword (Governance) also visible in Figure 3 is related to management, indicating that proper governing is an important concern to green finance. Researchers are also interested in Impact, or how much green finance may affect sustainability and development (Growth). China is the key player of green finance and thus is unsurprisingly an important research focus. Market, Finance and Investment fail to make to the top ten list, but they are clearly visible in Figure 3, implying the needs to study green finance topics from finance aspects.\n\n(Insert Figure 3 here)\n\nKeywords analysis conveys important information that can be used to clarify the conceptual points of green finance. It is obvious that green finance is related to climate change and should be policy driven. Issues of financing or investment on climate adaption are the key subject of interests. Green finance is not only relevant to environmental economists or scientists, but also requires contribution from economists and financial economists.\n\n# 3.4 Citation analysis\n\nPage 10 of 20\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nPapers on green finance are generally well cited. The average number of citations for the sample composed of 381 papers is 8.54. The highest citation number is 183 on Heinkel et al. (2001). Table 3 reports the top ten most cited papers in our sample. These ten papers come from very widely ranged sources, which indicates once again the interdisciplinary nature of this subject.\n\n(Insert Table 3 here)\n\nWe also investigate the source of references cited by these 381 papers. It is plotted in Figure 4. Clearly it is dominated by science, climate change and environmental journals. Though a few economics journals (for example, American Economic Review, Ecological Economics) are shown to affect these researches, it is obvious that finance journals are hardly involved. Citation analysis for cited journals also indicates how the relevant literature network is developed\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOND ISSUANCE<|>EVENT<|>The bond issuance reached a historical record of 155.5 billion US dollars in 2017, indicating a significant event in the financial market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|>GEO<|>The United States is a major contributor to green finance research and home to influential international organizations like the World Bank and UN.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>GEO<|>The European Union has the world's largest carbon trading market (EU ETS) and is a strong promoter of global cooperation on climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is an emerging economy and a key player in global greenhouse gas emissions, actively participating in green finance discussions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is an emerging economy with significant global GHG emissions, playing an increasingly important role in climate change debates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Bank is an influential international organization headquartered in the US that facilitates and encourages research in green finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is a major international organization that promotes global cooperation on climate change and green finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RFS CLIMATE FINANCE INITIATIVE<|>EVENT<|>An event held in London in 2018 focused on climate finance, linking to relevant research outputs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>EVENT<|>Green finance refers to financial activities that support sustainable development and address climate change issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Climate change is a significant global issue that green finance aims to address through various financial mechanisms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMIC RESEARCH<|>EVENT<|>Academic research in green finance is increasing, driven by high demand and interest from various researchers.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOND ISSUANCE<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>The record bond issuance indicates a growing interest and demand for green finance initiatives<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US<|>WORLD BANK<|>The World Bank is headquartered in the US, facilitating research and initiatives in green finance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US<|>UN<|>The UN is based in the US and plays a significant role in promoting global cooperation on climate change<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>The EU is a leading promoter of green finance and has established the largest carbon trading market<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>China is a key player in green finance discussions due to its significant GHG emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>India's participation in green finance discussions is crucial given its role in global emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RFS CLIMATE FINANCE INITIATIVE<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>The RFS Climate Finance Initiative is an event that focuses on advancing research in green finance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>Green finance aims to address the challenges posed by climate change through financial mechanisms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMIC RESEARCH<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>The increase in academic research outputs is linked to the growing interest in green finance<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
