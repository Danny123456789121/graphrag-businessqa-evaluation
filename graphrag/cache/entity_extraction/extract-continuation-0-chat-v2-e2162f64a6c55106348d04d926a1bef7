The strategies with an external focus (extroverted and visionary sustainability strategy) are likely to have a particularly strong societal impact. By achieving improvements in terms of the sustainability issues described above, both internal and external stakeholders (employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, neighbors and society itself) are likely to benefit.\n\n# Table 3: Social issues of business activities (based on Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; ISO, 2010)\n\n|Internal social issues|Internal social issues|\n|---|\n|• workplace health and safety, avoidance of workplace accidents|• employee orientation and employee development, attractiveness of the company to employees|\n|• corporate governance|• respect for human rights in the company|\n|• participation of employees in decision making|• protection of customer data|\n|• diversity and equality|• ethical behavior of the company (avoidance of corruption, cartelization)|\n| |• company´s contribution to societal development on a regional, national, or international level (e.g., job offers)|\n| |• integration of external stakeholders, ensuring stakeholder legitimacy|\n|External social issues|External social issues|\n|• respect for human rights in the company´s sphere of influence (e.g., with respect to child labor, rights of indigenous people, a right to labor unions and collective agreements)|• reporting on social aspects of the business activities|\n| |• product descriptions and consumer information|\n\nAn important task for management is now to identify the economic, environmental and social issues that are important to the company. This may be done by applying the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) with its five-level model sustainability principles, ABCD-planning procedure and funnel-metaphor (Broman and Robèrt, 2015). The FSSD is recommended because it provides robust, comprehensive and generic principles for sustainability, as well as a logical process for integrating these principles into strategic planning.\n\nThe funnel-metaphor is included in the FSSD to indicate how a current (non-sustainable) business practice will reduce the decision-making autonomy of companies in the mid- to long-term, since they are confronted with, for example, continually increasing social pressures and resource costs. This will lead to increased financial risks, and these are likely to be lower for more sustainable companies. By using the ABCD-planning process, a company can identify its options to comply with the FSSD sustainability principles and reduce the risk of sudden costs that jeopardize opportunities and are difficult to predict, as well as stay informed about cutting edge sustainability-driven business developments (Ny et al., 2006).\n\nNot all businesses have a positive social value, however, and whether a company delivers a positive societal value or not is based on societal perceptions about the company’s products and services, as well as its physical impact on the natural environment. There is, for instance, a considerable consensus that producing nuclear weapons does not generate positive societal values. In the case of conventional weapon systems, however, arguments concerning their relative social value are more mixed. Whether cars or coffee pods have a positive societal value is also debated.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nvalue is even more controversial. While both products have positive impacts on individual users, they also have clear systemic disadvantages. However, identifying the societal value of business activities from a sustainability perspective requires the application of robust sustainability principles as defined by the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015).\n\nBelow, four propositions are made, indicating how corporate sustainability management may enhance societal value.\n\n# Proposition 1a:\n\nIntegrating environmental and social issues into the content dimension of strategic management is a prerequisite to creating societal value.\n\n# Example 1a:\n\nConsidering environmental (such as CO2 emissions in production processes or the product portfolio) and social issues (such as working conditions throughout the supply chain) in strategic decisions to reduce negative impacts is beneficial for society and the biosphere.\n\nThe measurement of whether a company creates societal values from a sustainability perspective requires a benchmark or reference point. With regard to economic criteria, indicators such as tax payments, investment in local communities, or R&D expenditures are commonly used. With regard to environmental and social sustainability criteria, the Brundtland definition of sustainable development must be operationalized. Environmental and social problems may arise, for instance, from damage caused by emissions or poor working conditions. For example, Labuschagne et al. (2005), Krajnc and Glavic (2005) or Cunha Callado and Fensterseifer (2011) provided frameworks that could be used to measure corporate economic, environmental and social impacts. However, defining all kinds of environmental and social impacts is highly challenging, not only because different spatial conditions that change over time apply, but also because of the interdependencies between different issues and their impacts. Nevertheless, by focusing on the major factors involved, relatively robust sustainability principles can still be defined (Robèrt, 2000). Using the principles as defined in the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015) provides a solid, stable and comprehensive basis for assessing whether corporations create societal values or not. Additionally, these sustainability principles can be used as guides to define sustainability criteria (Hallstedt, 2015).\n\n# Proposition 1b:\n\nIn\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) provides principles for sustainability and a process for integrating these principles into strategic planning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAUMGARTNER AND EBNER<|>PERSON<|>Baumgartner and Ebner are researchers who contributed to the understanding of corporate sustainability strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ISO is an international standard development organization that provides frameworks for various management systems, including sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LABUSCHAGNE ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Labuschagne et al. are researchers who provided frameworks for measuring corporate economic, environmental, and social impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRAJNC AND GLAVIC<|>PERSON<|>Krajnc and Glavic are researchers who contributed to frameworks for assessing corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUNHA CALLADO AND FENSTERSEIFER<|>PERSON<|>Cunha Callado and Fensterseifer are researchers who provided frameworks for measuring corporate impacts on sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIETY<|>GEO<|>Society refers to the collective of individuals and communities that are impacted by corporate activities and sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOSPHERE<|>GEO<|>The biosphere encompasses all ecosystems and living organisms on Earth, which are affected by corporate environmental practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Corporate sustainability management involves strategies and practices aimed at enhancing societal value through sustainable business practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability principles are guidelines that help organizations assess and improve their environmental and social impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY<|>EVENT<|>A sustainability strategy is a plan that integrates environmental and social issues into corporate decision-making to create societal value.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>The FSSD provides a framework for integrating sustainability into corporate management practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAUMGARTNER AND EBNER<|>FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<|>Baumgartner and Ebner contributed to the development of the FSSD<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISO<|>FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<|>ISO provides standards that can be integrated into the FSSD for sustainability practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LABUSCHAGNE ET AL.<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Labuschagne et al. provided frameworks that can be used to measure impacts in corporate sustainability management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRAJNC AND GLAVIC<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Krajnc and Glavic contributed frameworks for assessing sustainability in corporate management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUNHA CALLADO AND FENSTERSEIFER<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Cunha Callado and Fensterseifer provided frameworks for measuring corporate impacts on sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIETY<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Corporate sustainability management aims to enhance societal value and address societal impacts<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOSPHERE<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Corporate sustainability management seeks to protect and enhance the biosphere through sustainable practices<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Sustainability principles guide corporate sustainability management practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>A sustainability strategy is a key component of corporate sustainability management<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
