In that case, carbon emissions for year t will be gradually reflected in returns over the year. An additional consideration is that investors obtain information about carbon emissions from multiple sources that are not all available at the same time. For example, a lot of firms disclose their emissions first to the CDP, data which then is merged into and combined with other sources by Trucost. Different information that is likely to be highly correlated with other information (given that all providers use the same data collection protocols) becomes available at different times. This is another reason why carbon emissions are only gradually reflected in stock returns.\n\nWe report the results in Table A.3. A remarkable pattern emerges from this analysis. Panel A1 reports the results for LOG (SCOPE 1 TOT). The coefficient is statistically significant for the first month (without industry fixed effects), remains significant at the 5% level until month 6 (with industry fixed effects), and is insignificant thereafter. Not surprisingly, it takes time for information about emissions to be reflected in stock prices, but eventually (after six months or so) this information appears to be fully absorbed. Essentially the same pattern is observed for the level of scope 2 and scope 3 emissions (with a somewhat faster (slower) integration of scope 2 (scope 3) emission information into stock prices), as the results in Panels A2 and A3 show. The same pattern is present for the growth in total emissions, as can be seen in panels B1, B2, and B3. However, emission intensity is nearly always insignificant, as we report in Panels C1, C2, and C3. The only visible exception is scope 1 emission intensity, which is significant at the 5% level in month 6 in the model with industry fixed effects. We conclude from this analysis that our results are not biased by a look-ahead effect.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that firms with higher emissions have also been exposed to unexpected positive value shocks. We explore this hypothesis by analyzing returns that strip out the effect of earnings surprises. Specifically, we subtract from the monthly stock returns the component that is realized on earnings announcement days and re-estimate the regression model in (1) with the adjusted returns. We report the results in Table 9 for the level of total emissions (Panel A), for the growth rate of emissions (Panel B), and for emission intensity (Panel C). We find no significant differential effect of earnings announcements on the carbon premium. Stocks with higher levels and growth rates of emissions still have higher returns, and emission intensity is still insignificant.\n\n# 3.3. Carbon premium and risk factors\n\n# Is the carbon premium linked to traditional risk factors?\n\nTo answer this question, we estimate the following time-series regression model using monthly data:\n\n, (2)\n\nwhere is the carbon return premium estimated from the cross-sectional Fama-MacBeth regression in Eq. (1); F is a set of factor-mimicking portfolios that includes MKTRF, HML, SMB, MOM, CMA, BAB, LIQ, NET ISSUANCE, and IDIO VOL. These factors have been widely used in many studies of asset prices. There are also economic reasons to believe that they could be meaningfully related to our carbon factor. Specifically, the first five factors correspond to the classic framework of Fama and French. In light of our results reported above, firm-level emissions are related to firm size and to firms’ growth opportunities; hence we include both the SMB and HML factors. The investment factor, CMA, controls for any differences in investments across firms. The market and momentum factors are standard controls in all time-series regressions. The BAB factor controls for the possibility that high carbon risk firms may be exposed to margin investments. The liquidity factor controls for possible differences in market liquidity among firms with different levels of carbon emissions, which could arise if some firms are not as actively traded as others due to ESG norm-based reasons. The net-issuance factor controls for any variation in capital structure and market timing by firm managers. Finally, the idiosyncratic volatility factor controls for the possibility that the measure of risk we capture may be idiosyncratic in nature. We calculate the standard errors of the coefficients using the Newey-West procedure with 12 lags to account for autocorrelation in error terms. Our coefficient of interest is , which measures the residual carbon premium, controlling for other risk/style factors.\n\n# Panel A\n\nPanel A in Table 10 shows the results for the carbon premium related to total emissions. In the odd columns, we report the unconditional carbon premium as a benchmark. In the even columns, we report results from regressions that add various factors MKTRF, HML, SMB, MOM, CMA, BAB, LIQ, NET ISSUANCE, and IDIO VOL. Comparing the odd and even columns for the respective scope categories of emissions, we find that the carbon premium remains statistically and economically significant after we adjust for differential factor exposures. However, the economic size of the premium is about 10%-20% smaller in magnitude. Overall, the regression intercepts from the cross-sectional return regressions are both economically and statistically significant in the presence of various risk factors.\n\n# Panel B\n\nPanel B shows the results for the carbon premium related to the growth rate in total emissions. We find again that the set of standard risk factors cannot explain the average value of the carbon premium for any of the emissions categories. This time, however, the difference in magnitudes across specifications is much smaller.\n\n# Panel C\n\nPanel C gives the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
