This is a novel result in the asset pricing literature. We obtain this result because we take greenness and environmental transparency seriously, unlike studies based on publicly traded funds or indices, which often market themselves as greener than they actually are. To attenuate the problem of greenwashing, we construct an index of greenness and environmental transparency at the individual company level, which takes into account both the GHG emission intensity of a company and the quality of its environmental disclosure. Based on this index we identify the greener and more transparent companies, while we select brown companies among those that do no disclosure, and operate in brown sectors. These two portfolios are used to define the greenness and transparency factor. The negative sign attached to the Greenium indicates that investors buy stacks of greener and more transparent firms accepting a ceteris paribus lower return, as a hedging strategy to reduce their exposure to climate risk. Based on a battery of robustness checks, we show that investors take into account both firms’ GHG emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures.\n\nIn the last part of the paper we use our model to price investors’ equity holdings. We find that their current portfolio allocation exposes them to non-negligible losses in a severe but plausible scenario, where greener and more transparent firms outperform brown firms. We estimate that direct losses could amount to 1.5% of the global equity exposure, and to USD 7 bn for European SIFIs overall. By adding up second-round effects and losses on loans and other assets, this figure could rapidly increase. We calculate that halving investors’ exposure to carbon-intensive activities would decrease losses only marginally, while only a radical portfolio reallocation towards greener\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
