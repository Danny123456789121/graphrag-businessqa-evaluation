Searches for event studies were conducted using electronic databases, including ABLINFORM, INFOTRAC, LEXIS, and PERI. An extensive manual search, making use of the reference lists of each event study, was also done to find additional event studies. Because there may be a bias among journal editors to print studies producing significant results, a special effort during the manual search phase was devoted toward finding yet-unpublished studies or studies appearing in conference proceedings. (Only a few of these studies, though, ultimately ended up passing the inclusion/exclusion criteria.) Each event study found during the search procedure was considered for inclusion in this article's meta-analysis, based on whether illegal behavior was involved and based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria generated from the definition of a CSR event; as given below.\n\n# Definition of a CSR event\n\nBecause this article uses the results of event studies as its data, it defines CSR in terms of \"events.\" The definition is given below. Within that definition can be found inclusion/exclusion criteria for deciding which event studies ought to be meta-analyzed here. The definition of a CSR event that this study uses is based on similar ones found in the business ethics literature defining moral issues and actions. A CSR event is:\n\n- An action by a firm, which the firm chooses to take, that substantially affects an identifiable social stakeholder's welfare.\n\nIn the paragraphs that follow, this definition will be unpacked for meaning: It has five components, and each will be explained. It will also be shown how in each case the five parts of the definition form, in essence, the criteria for determining whether a study's event is a CSR event and therefore whether the study ought to be included in or excluded from this meta-analysis.\n\n# An action by a firm\n\nThe first phrase in the definition indicates that CSR events must stem from actors that are firms and not governmental units. The purpose of this part of the definition is to put this meta-analysis squarely into the realm of corporate social responsibility and out of the public policy realm. In other words, the focus of this meta-analysis is on the market's response to the actions of corporations, not the actions of governmental units.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\n# Table 1\n\n# Event Studies With CSR Events\n\n|Study|Event|\n|---|---|\n|Peltzman (1981)|Federal Trade Commission (FTC) false advertising suits|\n|Garbade, Silber; and White (1982)|Department of Justice (DOJ) and FTC antitrust suits|\n|Eckbo (1983)|DOJ and FTC antitrust suits against bidders|\n|Eckbo (1983)|DOJ and FTC antitrust suits against targets|\n|Shane and Spicer (1983)|Council of Economic Priorities pollution ratings|\n|Strachan, Smith, and Beedles (1983)|Domestic criminal misconduct|\n|Wier (1983)|DOJ and FTC antitrust suits resulting in convictions|\n|Wier (1983)|DOJ and FTC antitrust suits resulting in settlements|\n|Jarrell and Peltzman (1985)|Pharmaceutical product recalls|\n|Jarrell and Peltzman (1985)|Automobile recalls|\n|Pruitt and Peterson (1986)|Nonautomobile product recalls|\n|Davidson and Worrell (1988)|Domestic criminal misconduct|\n|Hoffer; Pruitt; and Reilly (1988)|Automobile recalls|\n|Bromiley and Marcus (1989)|Automobile recalls|\n|Fry and Lee (1989)|Occupational Safety and Health Administration citations|\n|Muoghalu, Robison, and Glascock (1990)|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hazardous waste lawsuits|\n|Viscusi and Hersch (1990)|Agent Orange lawsuit|\n|Viscusi and Hersch (1990)|DES (pregnancy drug) lawsuit|\n|Block (1991)|Criminal misconduct|\n|Block (1991)|Federal Aviation Administration fines for airline safety violations|\n|Bosch and Eckard (1991)|DOJ indictments for price fixing|\n|Davidson and Worrell (1992)|Nonautomobile product recalls|\n|Alexander and Cohen (1993)|Criminal misconduct|\n|Karpoff and Lott (1993)|Criminal fraud|\n|LaPlante and LaNoie (1994)|Canadian EPA environmental lawsuits|\n|Davidson; Worrell, and Lee (1994)|Criminal misconduct|\n|Dranove and Olsen (1994)|Pharmaceutical product recalls|\n\ngovernmental agencies  Thus, an event study that examines the market's reaction to the government imposing new tax laws (e.g., Umlauf; 1993) is not of interest; but an event study that examines the market's reaction to firms choosing to break tax laws is of interest (e.g., Davidson and Worrell, 1988).
