Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

These five journals are chosen for two reasons. They are either ranked as the top journals in the area of management or mainly focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR). The authors also tried to include Business & Society (BAS), which has a high impact factor (1.936 in 2012), but BAS focuses on relatively wide-spread topics besides CSR, such as corporate governance, and business–government relations. So the authors did not conduct a manual search on it, but some papers on CSR–CFP (corporate financial performance) from BAS are included in the meta-analysis.\n\n# References\n\nAbbott, W.
