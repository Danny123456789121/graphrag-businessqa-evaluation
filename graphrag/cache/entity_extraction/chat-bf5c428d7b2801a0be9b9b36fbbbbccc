When working with\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Policymakers’ responsibilities\n\nIt is expected that the generative AI model will disrupt financial services. Thus, it is imperative to understand policymakers’ responsibility and preparedness for this disruption. As Huang reflected on the UK’s regulatory guidance on crypto-assets, research needs to evaluate the attitude of policymakers and what they are doing to help manage the impending technology transformation. Future research must understand if policymakers are trying to stop it or provide the relevant infrastructure needed to support it. Specifically, Mogaji and Nguyen examined managers’ comprehension on digital transformation of financial services in several countries. They found that policymaking in developing countries is lagging, indicating a need for further research to identify the differences in approaches between developing and developed nations.\n\n# The use of generative AI\n\nBanks must reflect on who will use the generative AI if and when it is developed. Would this generative AI be available to consumers seeking financial advice or bank managers for training and streamlining business operations? As with BloombergGPT which does not have a public-facing chatbot interface, banks will need to determine if they want to make generative AI available for consumers. This model can also be made available to third-party organizations including credit agencies and personal finance management apps. While it has advantages in enhancing financial services provision, there are significant implications on ethics, access to data, and trust in the advice offered.\n\n# Generative AI in retailing\n\n# Overview\n\nThe many waves of digitalization have constantly resulted in disruptions in the retail industry. In the past, retail activities (e.g., inventory management, sales) had to be done physically and manually. Since then, innovations such as the cash register and barcode have automated some aspects of retailing. More recently, the Internet has allowed companies to carry out their retail activities digitally via electronic retailing (e-tailing). With that said, e-tailing has been incorporated into the operations of many retailers ranging from small, local ones to multinational giants. This is predominantly due to the relatively low barriers to entry into e-tailing and increased digitalization among the general public.\n\n# Research agenda\n\n# Consumer awareness and attitude\n\nFuture research should investigate consumers’ awareness and attitudes toward generative AI by financial services providers. It is imperative to engage with consumers to evaluate if they would be willing to use it for financial advice, trust the output of generative AI, and envisage its use in banking services. Therefore, this research strand will extend the existing research on generative AI for banking services.\n\n# Managers’ awareness and attitude\n\nAs Mogaji and Nguyen evaluated managers’ understanding of AI concerning marketing financial services, future research will be required to understand bank employees’ willingness and attitudes toward generative AI. This research strand would need to include contact center agents, advisors, and marketing executives to evaluate their understanding of generative AI, level of technical capabilities to use these models, and impact on their job. As generative AI is posited to disrupt financial services workforces, future research needs to evaluate bank managers’ attitudes and preparedness for the disruption presented by generative AI.\n\nIn view of this, many retailers around the world have started integrating generative AI into their operations. For example, the grocery delivery company Instacart.\n\n# 18 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\n\nuses generative AI to answer questions from its custo- media sentiment. Based on this, detailed customer profiles with personalized recommendations and retail experiences can be generated. Expedia is a company that has integrated generative AI into its mobile application to provide users with personalized travel recommendations and planning assistance. Furthermore, companies can also employ generative AI to encourage customer co-creation. For instance, Coca-Cola encouraged people to create art through its new generative AI platform for a chance to be featured on its digital billboards. These would help retailers in enhancing their marketing strategies by understanding the customers’ preferred types of advertising; thereby increasing their competitive advantage and customer satisfaction.\n\n# Opportunities\n\nThere are endless opportunities that can be gained from integrating and deriving value from generative AI in the retail setting. This is because there is still much untapped potential as retailers are only in the early stages of incorporating generative AI with their operations. More recently, Google and Microsoft have made their generative AI available via an application programming interface. One key implication is that it enables retailers to integrate these tools into their systems. With that said, generative AI can offer benefits to retailers with regard to their front-end and back-end operations. More specifically, front-end operations refer to the retail activities that directly impact customers which include marketing and customer service. In contrast, back-end operations denote the functions that support retail activities that happen behind the scenes such as merchandising and data management.\n\n# Challenges\n\nThere are challenges that retailers need to overcome for the successful integration of generative AI into their operations. This section specifically highlights three major challenges which can be collectively referred to as the 3Ds.\n\nThe first challenge is related to data. It is undeniable that data plays a significant role in the utilization of generative AI to supplement various retail activities. While there is a lot more data available than ever before, it is fragmented across different platforms and sources. Besides, not all data is relevant in the decision-making of different retail activities. On the other hand, the lack of data is a problem that is pertinent among smaller retailers. This is because smaller retailers are unable to generate large volumes of data given the\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\nscale of their operations. This will put them at a major disadvantage as data is essential in refining the results of generative AI. Moreover, privacy is another significant concern as the input data and resulting\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
