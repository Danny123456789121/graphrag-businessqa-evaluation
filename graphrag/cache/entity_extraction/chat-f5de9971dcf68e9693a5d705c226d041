At present, the company is run by the second generation, Kosin Virapornsawan, who shares the original vision and mission to create a sustainable world. The written vision of PlanToys is “Better Kids, Better World”, with a belief to run a stakeholder-friendly business. PlanToys has expanded its distribution channel overseas through partnerships in Asia, America, Europe and Australia. Their products are educational toys for kids of all ages, with a large variety of products. PlanToys is chosen as the sample for the present study because the company is endorsed by the three criteria of sustainable enterprise [1]. The company also delivers the cultural, social, environmental and economic outputs and outcomes of self-reliance, immunity and resilience [3].\n\nWith over 640 employees and 350 SKUs to toys in 2019, PlanToys has an average annual revenue of 388 million Baht (approximately 12.2 million USD) with a registered capital of 150 million Baht (approximately 4.7 million USD). PlanToys has survived several crises over the past decades, ranging from the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, the subprime crisis in 2008, and the sudden increase in minimum labor wage by the Thai government in 2012. With prudent financial and operational risks management, PlanToys survived these crises by receiving support from employees and all stakeholders without laying off a single employee. PlanToys has a strong brand image. Customers trust the brand and constantly purchase safety toys for their kids, continuously maintaining its market leadership in Thailand.\n\n# 5. Discussions of the Findings\n\nOur findings reveal that many practices at Plan Creation are consistent with the Sufficiency Thinking model. The virtuous values and knowledge are infused throughout the entire enterprise. Evidence is also clear about the corporate Sufficiency Mindset that informs the practices. In the section below, we do not categorize our discussions by the virtuous values, knowledge and Sufficiency Mindset, and sustainability practices in this order. Instead, we present the sustainable leadership practices found at Plan Creation. We also demonstrate in detail how these practices are influenced by the Virtues, Knowledge, Sufficiency Mindset. However, the resulting outputs and outcomes are discussed respectively in this order.\n\n# 5.1. Sufficiency Thinking Practices\n\nVirtues are being practiced at Plan Creation. A practicing virtue at Plan Creation is perseverance that forms a strong company culture, a sustainable leadership practice. Perseverance starts when employees first join the company.\n\n“Most of our new employees are willing to learn the sufficiency thinking concept. Some of them are very enthusiastic and eager to learn new things. We prepare and support them for their career advancement. The company considers their background, performance, perseverance and other skills” (Marketing Officer)\n\nAs endorsed by the Perseverance predictor for corporate sustainability [5], perseverance at Plan Creation is a performance appraisal criterion. Performance evaluation is conducted annually, including other criteria as diligence, the ability to focus and deliver values. Perseverance at Plan Creation is seen clearly when it encounters a tough time. In the past crises, a united team of employees who exhibited an organizational citizenship behavior attitude at Plan Creation persisted despite a great obstacle to ensure corporate survival. Certainly, this enhances its corporate resilience.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n“At a time of crisis, we needed to reduce operating costs by reducing over time (OT) and to increase employees’ day offs, but there was no policy to reduce the number of staff. The top management team called for a meeting at the canteen to inform the situation to staff. At that time, there were not many staffs resigning. The staffs understood and were committed to ensuring the company’s survival.\" (HR Officer)\n\nConsistent with the sustainable leadership practice of considered organizational change, Plan Creation constantly adapts to the changing business environment, including new opportunities to expand its market. When a market however is declining, Plan Creation also finds a new market as a replacement. Such a practice is consistent with the long-term orientation practice of sustainable enterprises [26]. In terms of products, Plan Creation always innovate to add values to customers and to ensure sustainable competitive advantage, endorsed by the sustainable leadership practice of innovation. Staff at Plan Creation usually come up with small and continuous innovation, including incremental process improvement and its resulting cost saving. It is clear that the sustainable leadership approach of the long-term perspective improves its corporate ability to immune itself from external shocks.\n\n“Now we need to diversify our business to the new market, for example, toys for elderly, pets, and kids’ furniture. We need to plan for the new marketing strategy. Secondly, we need to change the selling platform. We have started with export, then wholesale and then will do more retail through online channel.” (Managing Director)\n\n“At the factory, there is a machinery development department. Systematically, it is in charge of bringing in innovative ideas to improve production processes and products.” (HR Officer)\n\nPerseverance at Plan Creation also reflects in its attempt to always adjust its standards to meet rising client expectations, consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of quality. They systematically consider and manage change here. Since more and more large clients prefer to set their own criteria for selecting suppliers, Plan Creation needs to be able to meet their demand. These demanding standards include ethical standards, environmental standards and production standards. Thus, “doing the right thing”, is an exhibited behavior among Plan Creation employees. Certainly, this behavior is in line with the sustainable leadership practice of ethical behavior.\n\n“PlanToys products help to support child development very well. I feel very confident in letting my children plays with PlanToys products because it made from the wood with high quality of standards. I would prefer my children playing with wooden toys rather than plastic toys.” (Customer A)\n\n“I have PlanToys on our office desk\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
