To ensure a high degree of content validity in this research, two rounds of pretests were conducted.\n\nRespondents from different industries and sectors were recruited in this study because such recruitment reduces common method variance problems. To effectively improve the response rate, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire, before the questionnaire was issued, we contacted the relevant companies by phone to determine whether they provided green products or related services and confirmed whether green products were their primary revenue source. We provided gifts to the respondents after they filled the questionnaire. On the first page of the questionnaire, the research objectives were explained, and informed consent was requested from the participants. The participants were then informed that the green products or related services provided by their company were the evaluation targets of the companyâ€™s GSV, EGC, EEP, and GPPO. We issued 750 formal questionnaires and obtained 475 valid questionnaires. Thus, the effective response rate was 63.33%. In this study, in order to effectively reduce the possible factors that MacKenzie and Podsakoff [80] pointed out that are likely to cause CMV, we can hide the respondent information, the design purpose of the item, and randomly sort the items when designing the questionnaire. Furthermore, as suggested by Cacioppo and Petty [81], the semantics and words used in the design of the questionnaire are closer to the background of respondents. This can improve the entire questionnaire design, and we can survey people in different industries or units. Afterwards, the CMV test was conducted through Harmanâ€™s one-factor test. The result indicated that the load of the first factor was 28.319%, which met the standard value below 50%. As a result, there was no serious CMV problem.\n\n# 3.2. Measurements\n\nThis research framework questionnaire contains four measurement dimensions (the scale presented in Appendix A), including GSV [25], GPPO [35], EGC [18,82], and EEP [46], using a 7-point Likert scale. While this research questionnaire refers to the scale developed by related scholars, there may still be research biases. This research is further verified through exploratory factor analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal rotation with varimax. The verification result shows that Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity and the Kaiserâ€“Meyerâ€“Olkin (KMO) value all as stated by standard value [83] is suitable for exploratory factor analysis, with 17 items and 4 components. The component names are the same as the original construct, namely GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP (Table 1). Nunnally and Bernstein [84] suggested that the standard value of correlation coefficient (Cronbachâ€™s Î±) should be more than 0.7 and each aspect meets the standard value. Consequently, the questionnaire of this research has good reliability.\n\n**Table 1.
