Here, we provide a roadmap for future research in this area:\n\n- What new roles and responsibilities are expected to emerge with the integration of AI in the L&SCM sector?\n- How will the skill requirements evolve for professionals in this sector by adopting AI-enabled technologies?\n- Which strategies can be implemented to facilitate a smooth workforce transition into AI-integrated environments?\n- How can training programs be designed to upskill and reskill existing employees for new roles generated due to AI adoption across different generations?\n- How is AI integration expected to influence career development and progression patterns in the L&SCM sector?\n- What new opportunities and challenges might professionals encounter in their career paths with the evolution of AI?\n- What are the implications of AI adoption on job security, worker rights, and labor market dynamics? The aim should be to study changing employment patterns, including contractual arrangements, freelance opportunities, wage structures, employment rates, and job security.\n- What ethical considerations are associated with AI-induced transitions in the job market?\n- How can organizations ensure inclusivity and fairness in AI-driven job environments?\n- How can policymakers foster a conducive environment for AI integration while safeguarding employee interests?\n\nTherefore, future research should focus on developing a balanced pathway that maximizes the benefits of AI integration while mitigating potential adverse impacts on the workforce. Through empirical analysis, researchers can help forge a future where AI transforms the sector and fosters an environment characterized by growth, opportunity, and inclusivity along the key tenets of Industry 5.0.\n\nAI is a promising catalyst for fostering regenerative and servitization business models in the L&SCM sector. On one hand, the regenerative model emphasizes restoring, renewing, and revitalizing one's sources of energy and materials, creating sustainable systems that integrate the community and environment at their core (Hahn & Tampe, 2021). AI can facilitate this by optimizing resource allocation, predicting material life cycles, and helping to create closed-loop systems that minimize waste and nurture the natural environment. On the other hand, the servitization model is centered on transitioning from selling products to delivering comprehensive services that offer higher value to customers. AI can play a pivotal role by analyzing customer data to craft personalized service offerings, predicting product maintenance needs before issues arise, and fostering dynamic and responsive service delivery channels. Through the adept analysis and utilization of heterogeneous big data, AI can thus aid in constructing innovative business models.\n\n# EDITORIAL\n\nthat drive economic growth and promote environmental rejuvenation and a more customer-centric approach, paving the way toward a more sustainable and service-oriented business landscape. This would pave the way for a new era where business models are characterized by innovation, inclusivity, and value creation. Several research questions that are critical to fostering a more profound comprehension and facilitating successful adaptation to the evolving business environment are as follows:\n\n- How can AI enhance service delivery and customer experience in the L&SCM sector?\n- What novel business models can emerge to leverage AI capabilities in enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction?\n- How can AI facilitate the integration of sustainable practices and circular economy principles into business models?\n- What role can AI play in fostering business models that promote resource efficiency and waste reduction?\n- How can AI contribute to enhancing transparency and traceability in supply chains?\n- What innovative business models can be developed to leverage AI for real-time tracking and reporting in supply chains?\n- How can AI aid in developing business models that enhance risk management and resilience in supply chains?\n- What are the prospects for AI in facilitating predictive analytics for proactive risk mitigation?\n- How can AI contribute to developing regenerative business models in the L&SCM sector focusing on societal benefits and ecological restoration?\n- What innovative strategies can be formulated using AI to foster business models that promote environmental regeneration and social equity?\n- How can organizations ensure compliance with regulatory requirements while adopting AI-driven business models?\n\nThe future research landscape should shed light on AI's transformative potential in shaping innovative business models within the L&SCM sector. By exploring the complex implications of AI integration, researchers can contribute to the evolution of business strategies that not only leverage the capabilities of AI but also foster sustainability, efficiency, and resilience in the industry.\n\n# LEVEL 4: L&SCM OUTCOMES\n\nThe future research landscape examining the impact of implementing AI applications, particularly focusing on productivity and performance enhancements, is vast and promising (Wamba et al., 2023). Several questions that researchers could explore to deepen the understanding in this area are outlined below.\n\n- How can AI systems streamline operations in the L&SCM sector?\n- What are the specific areas within supply chain operations where the application of AI can markedly enhance productivity?\n- How can AI transform customer service, supply chain, and logistics engagement? What innovations can AI bring in personalizing customer experiences and fostering stronger relationships?\n- What are the prospects for AI in fostering innovations that promote resource optimization and environmental sustainability?\n- How can AI facilitate better knowledge management and foster innovation in supply chain operations?\n- What avenues can AI open for creating knowledge repositories and facilitating organizational learning and innovation?\n- What opportunities can emerge from successfully integrating AI technologies in enhancing supply chain performance?\n\nThe research should involve understanding the potential enhancements in productivity and performance and exploring innovative strategies and models that can redefine the sector's trajectory. Through rigorous studies, researchers can foster a knowledge base that guides organizations in leveraging AI to craft a more efficient, sustainable, and responsive supply chain landscape. Future research should prioritize an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from fields such as environmental science, data science, and L&SCM management, to holistically study the potential of AI in fostering a more sustainable L&SCM management. This includes analyzing the direct impacts on environmental and social sustainability and examining the broader implications for industry practices, policies, and governance structures. The key research questions that emerge are outlined below.\n\n- How can AI facilitate the development of more sustainable supply chain networks?\n- In what ways\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
