This study thus uses sustainable resource management (SRM) to improve corporate sustainability (CS) performance considering the socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficacy aspects. In this study, the vague set (VS) theory and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method are integrated as a hybrid decision-making tool by which social media data can be transformed into entropy weights. The results indicate eco-efficacy and society should be prioritized to improve the corporate sustainability performance. Specifically, the aspects should be promoted through encouraging environmental innovation, redesigning consumers' offer, raising support of the institutions and policy measures, and organizing synergetic involvement. The contributions of this study are three-fold: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment data and social media information and address the interrelationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM criteria to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe Chinese automobile industry has witnessed a surge growth since the 21st century. In 2007, the amount of China's automobile production had reached 8.88 million, which resulted in a net increase of 16.6 million over the previous year. In the meanwhile, automobile sales reached 8.79 million. Under the 2030 sustainable development goals agenda, the Chinese automobile industry is striving for sustainable development. The industry is seeking appropriate managerial paths to balance the economic performance, environmental benefits and social reputation under limited resources. SRM is considered as a key instrument in assisting industrial sector to achieve the CS goal when developing sustainable resource strategies. Lozano (2012) defined CS as “corporate activity seeking to achieve sustainability equilibrium, which consists of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions (i.e. triple bottom line, TBL), for today as well as throughout the time dimension while addressing the firm's systems and its stakeholders”. However, it is argued that these three pillars of TBL can neither cover the entire concept of corporate sustainability, nor sufficiently address CS issues (Bordass, 2000; Jeurissen, 2000; Wu et al., 2018). Consequently, these studies presented difficulties in precisely identifying the CS problems merely from economic, environmental and social perspectives (Wu et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019d). Furthermore, TBL was found that it existed conflicts and overlapped field among themselves (Tseng et al., 2019b). Therefore, the socio-economic, socio-environmental and eco-efficacy aspects are added as a supplementary of TBL to enrich the CS literature (Wu et al., 2019a). Therefore, this study attempts to adopt SRM practice based on the TBL dimensions with the socio-economic, socio-environmental and eco-efficacy aspects to provide precise guidelines for Chinese automobile industry.\n\nThe Chinese automobile industry also requires a valid tool to be adopted to process types of data for decision making. Previous studies mainly considered qualitative data or quantitative data to inform decision-making processes when they discussed SRM issues (Mak et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b). However, these studies ignored the critical type of data which stemmed from social media. Song et al. (2019) pointed out social media data can assist firms to avoid blind.\n\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Thus, this study designs a scrapping tool to collect the frequencies of keywords from social media and transfer them into corresponding entropy weights. Moreover, SRM is characterized with nonlinear, systematic feature (Song et al., 2019). Wu et al. (2019b) stated SRM possesses multiple criteria and includes several qualitative perspectives. Therefore, this study integrates VS and TOPSIS to address these problems. The novel VS-TOPSIS tool enables the transformation of experts' linguistic preference to vague set assessment matrix, as well as arranges all the obtained individual pro-t ratio matrix into the decision matrix. The ranking order can be computed to offer a specific direction for firms to utilize SRM practice to effectively and efficiently improve their CS performance.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this study is to explore the inter-relationship between SRM and CS\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
