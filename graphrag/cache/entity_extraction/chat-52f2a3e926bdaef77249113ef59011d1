Moreover, while accounting-based measures of CFP are limited in that they entail a historical perspective (Hamann et al. 2013; Peloza 2009; Richard et al. 2009), stock market returns incorporate assessments of a firm’s prospective development and reflect the notion of external stakeholders, especially investors, regarding future performance (Fryxell and Barton 1990; Hamann et al. 2013). Thus, event studies imply a forward-looking view on the financial consequences of CEP. This point is of crucial importance because several potentially beneficial impacts of CEP are considered to accrue in the long term (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Peloza 2009). In addition, stock market returns also incorporate intangible assets and reputation effects (Richard et al. 2009), which are obviously relevant given the theoretically proposed mechanism linking CEP and CFP.\n\nAnother advantage of event studies for examining the CEP–CFP link is that they can rather clearly determine the direction of causality (Heal 2005). While correlation and regression-based studies in most instances cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality or endogeneity, issues that are likely to be at play in the relationship between CEP and CFP (Endrikat et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Hart and Ahuja 1996; Surroca et al. 2010); event studies reasonably allow inferring causality running from CEP to CFP.3\n\nFurthermore, as several third variables (either of moderating or mediating nature) have been suggested to be involved in the CEP–CFP link (Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Russo and Minto 2012), it is of crucial importance to control for such factors in empirical tests in order to ensure valid and reliable results.4 In this regard, event studies “are unusually precise because companies serve as their own matched control when its stock price is compared before versus after a news announcement” (Margolis et al. 2009, pp. 13–14).\n\nDue to the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytic overall effect calculated from event studies would provide strong evidence with regard to the question whether CEP has an impact upon CFP and if this impact is positive or negative.\n\nIn view of the preceding considerations regarding the theoretical arguments and given the results of available meta-analyses, the following hypotheses are posited:\n\nH1a Across the body of event studies, there is a positive stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.\n\nH1b Across the body of event studies, there is a negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events.\n\n# Positive and Negative Events: Asymmetry in the Stock Market Reactions\n\nThere are several event studies, which have examined the stock market reactions to both positive and negative CEP-related events. Some of those studies found stronger stock market reactions (in terms of magnitude of the ARs or CARs) to negative events compared to positive events (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996; Lorraine et al. 2004). Thus, there seems to be some evidence that the market punishes firms in cases of negative CEP-related events to a greater extent than it values firms in cases of positive CEP-related events. In other words, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events appear to be asymmetric.\n\nThere may be several reasons for reverse causal links between CEP and CFP. For example, firms with superior CFP may be likely to possess slack resources that allow them to invest in environmental activities (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Waddock and Graves 1997). Furthermore, also CEP related events themselves might be a trigger for causal links from CFP to CEP. For instance, negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events in time period one may initiate corporate environmental investments leading to improved CEP in time period two. (I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point).\n\nFor example, previous empirical studies have revealed moderating effects of firm size (e.g., Sharma and Henriques 2005), innovation activities (e.g., Wagner 2010), or industry characteristics (e.g., Hull and Rothenberg 2008) and mediating effects of reputation (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997), organizational culture (e.g., Surroca et al. 2010), or firm risk (e.g., Bansal and Clelland 2004).\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\nDifferent non-exclusive explanations can be offered for this phenomenon. Psychological research, in particular research on impression formation (e.g., Anderson 1981), consistently indicates that individual impressions and judgments concerning particular events or situations are inordinately influenced by more negative information than by positive information (Baumeister et al. 2001; Skowronski and Carlston 1989). That is, humans weigh negative events more heavily than positive events (Jayachandran et al. 2013; Lankoski 2009). This pattern, denoted as negativity bias or positive–negative asymmetry effect, has been recognized and repeatedly confirmed in several research domains (Baumeister et al. 2001\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
