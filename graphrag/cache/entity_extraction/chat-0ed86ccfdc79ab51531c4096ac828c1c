The paradox perspective, building on the recent advancement of organizational paradox theory, posits that organizations are rife with persistent, contradictory, yet mutually interdependent demands (Smith and Lewis, 2011). The paradox theory has been applied to explain diverse organizational phenomena, including leadership (e.g., Zhang et al., 2015, 2017) and innovation (e.g., Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009). For corporate sustainability, pursuing competing economic, social, and environment goals at the same time is essentially an organizational paradox (Hahn et al., 2014). The paradox perspective acknowledges the tensions underlying opposing goals. However, in contrast to other perspectives, the paradox perspective centers on the tensions with which organization and management scholars have little choice but to engage (Lindgreen and Maon, 2019), exploring how organizations and decision-makers experience and manage the tensions underlying the sustainability paradox (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Gao and Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2015). For example, in contrast to ignoring or eliminating conflicts (an “either/or” solution), scholars have found that embracing the tensions can lead to an innovative (“both-and”) solution, followed by sustainable outcomes (Tracey et al., 2011; Jarzabkowski et al., 2013; Jay, 2013; Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015; Ortiz-de-Mandojana and Bansal, 2016).\n\nIn this study, the authors adopt the dynamic equilibrium model proposed by Smith and Lewis (2011) on organizational paradox theory, attempting to offer a systematic review of academic developments in the management of the corporate sustainability paradox. The dynamic equilibrium model is influential in the literature of organizational paradox. It assumes that opposing forces of a paradox are dynamic rather than static, are persistent rather than transient within complex systems, and can be beneficial and powerful rather than detrimental and threatening. Specifically, the model encompasses three stages: how latent tensions turn into salience, how management strategies enable reinforcing cycles, and the outcomes of paradox management. The first stage introduces environmental factors and individuals’ cognition and rhetoric as the major two types of manifestation forces that render the latent paradoxical forces (e.g., social goal and economic goal) salient and tensional. The second stage proposes how resolution and acceptance strategies fuel vicious and virtuous cycles. The last stage describes how, while focusing on one goal might achieve short-term success, long-term sustainability depends on constant efforts to address the diverging goals in a mutually reinforcing fashion. As a meta-theoretical perspective, the model encompasses the nature, approach, and impact of paradox management, providing a holistic guide to frame and explore how sustainability as disciplinary knowledge deals with its own inherent paradoxes (Smith and Lewis, 2011, p. 297).\n\nThe current work is not the first review on the paradox perspective in the corporate sustainability field. In an earlier review, Van der Byl and Slawinski (2015) identify four major approaches in corporate sustainability, that is, win–win, trade-off, integrative, and paradox perspectives. The reviewers mainly offer a conceptual distinction of the paradox perspective from the other three perspectives and highlight the emergence of the paradox perspective in corporate sustainability research. However, up to 2014, the year before Van der Byl and Slawinski’s review was published, only eight articles (e.g., Berger et al., 2007; Wijen and Ansari, 2007) were found to adopt such a paradox lens. Later, in 2018, the Journal of Business Ethics published a thematic symposium on “paradoxes in corporate sustainability.” Among the issued articles, Hahn et al. (2018) are the first to develop a three-aspect framework, namely, descriptive, instrumental, and normative, and locate the six articles in the symposium within different aspects. Thereafter, the paradox perspective gained increasing recognition and sparked intensive research work among corporate sustainability scholars (e.g., Smith and Besharov, 2019; Hengst et al., 2020; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020).\n\n# Luo et al. Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\n2020). However, as a disciplinary approach, this perspective is still in its infancy in the corporate sustainability area. Considering the rapid emergence of recent literature and the insufficient exploitation of existing research, a comprehensive and systemic review of corporate sustainability from the paradox perspective is timely and imperative. There is no preexisting published review specifically on this topic.\n\nGuided by the three-stage dynamic equilibrium model, in this review, the authors aim to reveal the existing approaches to the manifestation of corporate sustainability tensions, the management of such tensions, and the downstream outcomes. In the rest of this article, the authors first outline the method for the selection of papers in the literature, then present the findings and discuss a future agenda for further corporate sustainability research, and finally outline the implications and conclusions of the review.\n\n# RESEARCH METHODS\n\nTo conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability from an organizational paradox perspective (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015), the authors followed the PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) to the extent that they apply to non-medical systematic reviews.
