After receiving the signal, relevant stakeholders may provide premiums to organizations if these stakeholders value the above unobservable characteristics (Ramchander et al., 2012; Spence, 1973). The CSR signal can gain support to meet stakeholder demands, prevent costly conflicts, improve stakeholder relationships, and enhance business performance. In other words, better CSR could be the difference that would improve employee satisfaction, corporate reputation, and\n\nM. Hou et al.\n\ncustomer loyalty, all ultimately beneficial to firm outcomes (Hart & Ahuja, 1996). In addition, environmental pollution is becoming a critical problem in East Asia, so governments have established related policies to encourage environmentally friendly activities. Thus firms engaging in environmental CSR to reduce pollution, recycle, and reduce energy consumption can receive grants and incentives (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006; Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Besides, investors and financial analysts also attach great importance to organization’s CSR practices (Doh, Howton, Howton, & Siegel, 2010; Luo, Wang, Raithel, & Zheng, 2015).\n\nPrevious empirical studies have obtained promising evidence that types of CSR signals are beneficial in East Asia. For example, citizenship and employee commitment were found to be positively related in China (Chun, 2009). Philanthropic disaster relief was found to positively impact firm profitability in China (Gao, 2011). CSR (both equal-weighted and stakeholder-weighted CSR indexes) was found to be positively related with business performance in Korea (Choi et al., 2010). CSR scores were found to be positively related with ROA indicators in Asian samples (Scholtens & Kang, 2012). Those studies prompt us to argue for a positive relationship between CSR and business performance in the East Asian context. Therefore, we propose the following:\n\n# Hypothesis 1\n\nIn East Asia, corporate social responsibility is positively related to business performance.\n\n# Environmental CSR vs. social CSR\n\nIn the current CSR–performance literature, CSR has been identified as environmental performance, corporate philanthropy, and ethical behavior, all referring to different scopes and contents of CSR practice. We investigate how the categories of CSR affect the CSR–performance relationship. According to the types of CSR signals, we divide CSR practice into two categories: environmental and social CSR (Baughn et al., 2007). Environmental CSR captures natural environmental protection and green production. Social CSR is related to social and community issues such as ethical behavior and corporate philanthropy (Marín, Rubio, & Maya, 2012). Environmental CSR can transfer “green signals” to stakeholders, while social CSR mainly send “good signals.” Both CSR types can send signals and satisfy stakeholders’ demands and yield competitive advantage. However, environmental CSR and social CSR have different influences in the aspect of signaling.\n\nAlthough in the past, the natural environment took a back seat to boosting the economic development in East Asia, the public and government value more about environmental issues (Baughn et al., 2007). We argue that the natural environment is closely tied to human health; everyone has a stake in environmental CSR practices. Under great pressure from the public, communities, and the media, the Chinese government has pledged $275 billion over the next five years to clean the air. Since January 2014, 15,000 factories, including large state-owned enterprises, have been required to publicly report real-time figures on their air emissions and water discharges. The government promises to improve environmental quality, and asks firms to enhance their environmental CSR practices to assist in the cleanup. These environmental CSR activities help firms build close relationship with governments, obtain political legitimacy, and get access to key regulatory resources (Sheng, Zhou, & Li, 2011), which in turn may bring beneficial privileges. Other studies also demonstrated a more important role of environmental CSR in East Asian regions. In Tanimoto and Suzuki’s (2005)\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nIn their research, they found that Japanese firms prefer to disclose CSR information about environmental conservation policies and relative activities rather than social issues. Welford’s (2005) research found that 50% of Korean enterprises and 62% of Japanese enterprises had detailed policies on environmental protection reporting. In South Korea, there was a greater emphasis on green production processes (environmental CSR) and less emphasis on employee relations (social CSR) (Chapple & Moon, 2005). Drawing from over 8700 surveys of firms in 104 countries, Baughn et al. (2007) found that both Japanese and Taiwanese regions demonstrate substantially higher commitment to environmental than social CSR. They also found the level of environmental CSR was higher than social CSR in South Korea (Baughn et al., 2007). Welford (2005) also conducted surveys to compare CSR in different regions and found social CSR (philanthropy) was most prevalent in North America, significantly lower in Europe and even lower in Asia. We argue that East Asian firm’s stakeholders are expressing more concern about firm’s natural environmental signals. That is, the “green signals” are more attractive than “good signals” to stakeholders in East Asian contexts. In contrast, Western countries are focused more on social CSR, which emphasizes social and community issues, ethical behavior, and corporate philanthropy. Thus, we expect:\n\n# Hypothesis 2\n\nIn East Asia, environmental CSR has a stronger positive effect on business performance than social CSR.\n\n# Operational performance vs. financial performance\n\nMost practicing managers and branches of organization and management research are interested in business performance as a recurrent theme (Richarc, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). In the CSR research area, CSR and business performance have mixed relationships partly because of diverse performance measures (Lev, Petrov\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
