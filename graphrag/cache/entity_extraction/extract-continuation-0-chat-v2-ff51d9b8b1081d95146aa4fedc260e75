Alternatively, the rigor provides an avenue for analysts to convince managers of the scientific propensity of the technique, further justifying decisions.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n# 5.3. Future Research Directions\n\nAlthough we believe that our study can provide a new framework and a decision-making tool for selecting and evaluating suppliers in the sustainable supply chain, our research work could be expanded and improved in future research. Some future directions are identified as follows:\n\n- This study was more methodologically oriented as the research showed how the methodology can integrate various complex issues in managerial decision-making. As the problem size increases, the applicability and accuracy of the model will require further investigation. For example, what if the number of factors increases regarding the number of alternatives or criteria?\n- A complete validation of the study will be undertaken by considering more scenarios. Experimenting with the methodology would be worthwhile to determine if all scenarios are supportive. For example, what if all the data were known, or only known data were utilized? What if none of the data were known and it was a completely new product with new suppliers? How well can the model learn? These are all questions that may be asked in various experimental scenarios or in long-term longitudinal studies.\n- It will be also useful to expand the BN model with indicators for some criteria and to consider the decision-maker characteristics; for example, would supply chain managers differ from engineering or marketing managers?\n- Furthermore, the proposed model can be solved by using other approaches and the obtained results can be compared with each other using the Spearman rank correlation method, such as multiple criteria tools including ANP, TOPSIS and PROMETHEE, to name a few. Otherwise, different methods can be compared regarding the time, the complexity and the restriction on the number of alternatives or criteria used in the selection process in order to identify which method is more robust.\n- Additionally, this study can be extended to other domains for evaluation and selection decision-making problems. The update of the evaluation criteria according to each specific case will be necessary.\n\nFinally, we sought to integrate a series of tools and found the technique useful and feasible. Thus, we continue to build on the important supplier selection field and knowledge.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, N.K., A.J. and J.S.; Methodology, N.K., A.J. and J.S.; Visualization N.K. and A.J.; Formal Analysis & investigation, N.K. and A.J.; Validation, A.J. and J.S.; Resources and Data curation N.K. and A.J.; Supervision, J.S.; Writing—Original draft, N.K. and A.J.; Writing—Review & editing, N.K., A.J. and J.S.
