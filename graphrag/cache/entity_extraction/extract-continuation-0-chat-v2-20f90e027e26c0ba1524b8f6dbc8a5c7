Accordingly, the model can be formulated as follows (Card & Krueger, 1995):\n\nri = β0 + β1SE(ri) + εi  εi ∼ N(0, SE(ri))\n\nThe dependent variable ri is the i‐th partial correlation coefficient, SE(ri) is the standard error of the partial correlation, and εi is the error term.\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\nAs proposed by the Egger test (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997), the t‐test of the regression coefficient β1 in this model investigates publication selection bias. If β1 = 0, it can be reasoned that literature is unbiased. Hence, the probability of measuring the true population effect increases with the precision of the estimates, and the reported effect estimates in the primary studies are normally (symmetrically) distributed around the true population effect. If there is statistically significant evidence that β1 ≠ 0, certain results are overrepresented, and the presence of publication bias would be confirmed.\n\nWhile performing the publication bias test, the following aspects are considered in the model specification. (a) The errors of the regression might be heteroskedastic due to the usual great variation of the standard errors of the reported estimates across the primary studies. Therefore, a weighted least squares (WLS) approach is conducted using the inverse standard errors of the effect sizes as weights. Accordingly, studies reporting lower standard errors, more precise results respectively, get larger weights in the MRA estimation (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). (b) Multiple estimates per study are integrated in our meta‐analysis. For this reason, potential within‐study correlation among the effect sizes obtained from the same study has to be taken into account. Thus, standard errors are clustered at the level of each individual study (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). (c) We perform a random‐effects model to account for residual heterogeneity. The latter might, for example, come from deviations of the effect sizes due to unobserved heterogeneity on the firm‐level (such as management quality).\n\n# 4 | PRESENTATION OF META ‐ANALYTICAL RESULTS\n\n# 4.1 | Results of Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis\n\nFor the analysis of the causality between CEP and CFP, we conduct Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis measuring the effect between CEP and CFP in the form of a random‐effects mean effect size. The adequacy of the random‐effects model is especially motivated by the results from heterogeneity tests. Table 1 sums up the results given by the Q statistic (Cochran's heterogeneity statistic), I2 (percentage of total variation across studies, which stems from heterogeneity rather than chance), and τ2 (variance of the effect size parameters across the population of studies; Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). In general, the statistics confirm that a statistically and economically significant part of the variation of effect sizes stems from heterogeneity. For this reason, the assumption of random effects seems appropriate.\n\nThe random‐effects model is applied to various subsamples of effect sizes measuring the relation between CEP and CFP depending.\n\n**Table 1 Results of Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis**\n|Subsample|n|k|Random‐effects mean effect size|Standard error|Q statistic (df)|I2 (%)|τ|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Full sample|142|893|0.072***|0.006|5217.99*** (892)|85.68|0.144|\n|CEPt ↔ CFPt Total|106|569|0.077***|0.007|2705.32*** (568)|82.32|0.134|\n|CEPt → CFPt+j Total|46|260|0.056***|0.010|1553.49*** (259)|89.40|0.150|\n|j = 1|42|186|0.030**|0.012|1112.07*** (185)|88.10|0.146|\n|j = 2|9|54|0.110***|0.024|376.06***(53)|93.40|0.161|\n|j = 3|5|18|0.158***|0.022|18.65 (17)|0.02|0.001|\n|j = 5|1|2|0.117***|0.031|0.05 (1)|0.00|0.000|\n|CFPt‐j → CEPt Total|12|64|0.100***|0.020|672.76***(63)|88.23|0.146|\n|j = 1|10|59|0.104***|0.021|667.68***(58)|89.35|0.150|\n|j = 2 a|1|1|−0.058|0.118|−|−|−|\n|j = 3 a|1|4|0.055|0.041|−|−|−|\n|j = 5 a|0|0|−|−|−|−|−|\n\nNote.
