DISCUSSION\n\nAlthough our meta-analysis refers to board composition attributes, we are aware that there are further variables of corporate governance (e.g. external corporate governance as block holding or individual board attributes as CEO tenure). The board composition variables that were taken into consideration...\n\n# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\n\nAccount in previous studies have interdependencies as well and should be specified. With respect to gender diversity, it remains open to question whether women on boards have an impact on CSR reporting. Thus, it should be analyzed to what extent female directors have a positive influence on CSR reporting. The critical mass theory indicates that a critical mass of women on boards is necessary to change board attitude towards CSR strategy and reporting. Surprisingly, up to now, sustainable management compensation and the structure thereof have not been analyzed so far.\n\nIn line with these recommendations, future research should also include other board composition variables that might have an impact on CSR reporting. The first useful variable to include in future CSR research is board tenure diversity. Rao and Tilt (2016b) state that short-term relationships may contribute to limited awareness of CSR reporting because the specific board member has only little firm-specific knowledge. Another variable that is not well recognized in current research on CSR reporting is the existence of multiple directorships. According to Elsakit and Worthington (2014), the participation of the chairman of the board in discussions regarding CSR reporting is expected to have a positive impact on CSR reporting. Finally, as board diversity represents one of the main board composition variables in current empirical research, board outcome is the result of the collective discussion, so that an overall diversity variable is useful to analyze the combined effect of diversity on CSR reporting. The “Blau index” (Blau, 1977) has reached a key relevance in empirical diversity research, but not in CSR reporting research (Rao & Tilt, 2016b).\n\nMultinational studies are not very common in our sample. There is a need for further research because a key aspect is the impact of different cultures in different countries on board composition and CSR reporting practice as a mediator, with special reference to the risk of litigation (Morros, 2016). Culture is relevant in view of the different ranges of stakeholder pressure on CSR reporting practice in a specific society. Most of our included studies contribute to developing countries and only differ between the banking industry and other industries. We encourage future researchers to focus on European member states with regard to the huge regulations on board composition and CSR reporting during the last years. It seems to be important to analyze the different branches of non-financial industries to a greater extent (e.g. pharmacy, automobiles) as the contents of CSR reporting will differ.\n\nOur meta-analysis has also main regulatory implications. In contrast to the US-American capital market, the European legislator and other regimes (e.g. South Africa) have finalized reform initiatives on board composition and CSR reporting since the financial crisis. The intention is to increase the motives for high quality CSR reporting. However, we know very little if these regulations will positively contribute to board effectiveness and CSR reporting. The related implementation and transaction costs and the market implications of a decision-useful CSR reporting are rather a “black box”. Sustainable management behaviour won’t be generally generated by stricter regulations on board composition and CSR reporting. In order to prevent greenwashing of CSR reporting and information overflow, the board of directors must implement a sustainable vision and philosophy as a top-down approach in accordance with the total employees and permanent dialogue with related departments (e.g. finance and accounting) (Schaltegger & Zvezdov, 2015).\n\nPractical implications can be also stressed. In general, the included studies in our meta-analysis found rather low CSR reporting scores in their descriptive statistics. Insofar, there are many possibilities for improvements in CSR reporting activities. Management should not only be aware of the reporting costs but also on the positive link on firm reputation and stakeholder trust, which could lead to better (non) financial performance in the long run. However, CSR practices may not generally be transformed into decision-useful CSR reporting (Majeed et al., 2015). Insofar, firms without CSR reporting can be active in CSR management and may plan to introduce a CSR report in the future. Even though some studies indicate that PIEs have higher CSR disclosure scores, also small and medium-sized entities are aware of CSR, especially family firms.\n\n# 6. CONCLUSION\n\nEmpirical research on the impact of board composition on CSR reporting has increased since the last decade. As CSR reporting usually includes corporate governance information, e.g. sustainable management compensation or gender diversity, there many interdependencies between corporate governance and CSR reporting (“sustainable corporate governance”).
