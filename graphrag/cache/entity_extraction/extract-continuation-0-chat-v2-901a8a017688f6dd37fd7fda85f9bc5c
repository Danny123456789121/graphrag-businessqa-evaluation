Perrini and Minoja (2008) emphasized that corporate behavior towards sustainability has gained a central position among sustainability-conscious decision-makers. Policy formulation and implementation are two different domains (Galbreath 2009), and according to Kotler (2001), policy implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organizational objectives. Therefore, despite focusing on sustainability policy and planning, failures in the implementation phase occur up to some extent; one reason for the failure of sustainability policy is the gap between policy and its implementation. In view, Ménard et al. (2018) argued that policies are written documents, and, without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication cannot be implemented in the contexts.\n\nIt is rare in literature how to make a policy coherent with all three dimensions of CS (Klettner et al. 2014); thus, when management device policies and when it implements, most of the time it lacks (Spiller and Savedoff 1999). One core gap, which causes flaws, is the lack of leadership commitment and the clarification/understanding of policy. Ménard et al. (2018) argued that meso-institutions are responsible for the implementation and operationalization of policies; if not adequately addressed the policy, then they mislead and end up with gaps between policy and practice.\n\nThere are several contributing factors to the success or failure of policies. Roosa (2007) argued that sustainability policy’s objectives and goals could not be achieved without the contribution and successful nexus of stakeholders (citizens) and the policymaking authorities.\n\nJiménez and Pérez-Foguet (2010) argued that gaps between policies and practices occur particularly in developing countries due to unrealistic thinking, overambitious policies, objectives that are distant from reality, local culture, norms and values of society. Unrealistic policies end-up with gaps when these policies come to the level of implementation. Ménard et al. (2018) also argued that some part of the gap arises due to poor performance of meso-institutions.\n\nBonn and Fisher (2011) explained that CS is the missing part of the policy, and it must be incorporated in the organizations’ strategic decisions. Corporate policy and CS policy of the organization in the form of a single organizational strategy can address problems of environmental and social dimensions along with profit maximization (Engert et al. 2016). Baumgartner (2014) said that making a CS policy is not the only important factor, but how to implement the same is even more essential.\n\nDespite the popularity of CS and its priority in the western world, one single generic policy encompassing CS and organizational strategy may not be equally adaptable for all.\n\norganizations due to the specific needs and demands of differ-\n\nent stakeholders. Hence, the companies’ management has to\n\nput their efforts and look into their particular needs while\n\nformulating the policies (Bos Brouwers 2010; Gouldson and\n\nSullivan 2007; Springett 2003). One more area which needs\n\nattention is that when policymakers need to choose one among\n\nenvironment and economic dimension; policymakers always\n\nsupersede the economic dimension over the environmental\n\ndimension. Paulraj (2009) argued that commitment to the pol-\n\nicy and implementation of the policy are two different and\n\nindependent factors, and companies opt the minimum of legal\n\ncompliances and try to resolve the environmental issues.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of developing countries, it\n\nvaries from country to country according to their needs and\n\ndemands (Abreu 2009).\n\nWith the passage of time, most companies have started\n\nadopting the CS, instead of avoiding it as the management\n\nof the companies has realized that by adopting CS, efficiency\n\nand productivity of the company may be increased (Jnr et al.\n\n2019). However, to become a responsible organization in the\n\nbusiness community, it requires planning in the realm of\n\npolicymaking and implementation, which may not only take\n\nthe organization beyond the profitmaking and legal compli-\n\nance but also provides the opportunity to work for the mitiga-\n\ntion of risk aversion and bridging gaps between business and\n\nsociety (Morgan et al. 2009). Furthermore, CS addresses the\n\nissues of well-being and environmental degradation. It also\n\nguides management to resolve the core problems related to\n\ntheir products (Werther and Chandler 2010).\n\n# Corporate sustainability policy approaches\n\nThere are several underlying approaches to develop a policy\n\nfor CS. Researchers contributed different ideas in this realm;\n\nall have their rationale and significance. Scholars have\n\ndiscussed different approaches (Klettner et al. 2014).\n\nPedersen (2006) stressed that in social responsibility, the par-\n\nticipatory approach has five elements to understand the dia-\n\nlogue between social responsibility and stakeholders; it\n\nincludes inclusion, openness, tolerance, empowerment, and\n\ntransparency.\n\nDavies (2009) suggested the idea of a Grassroots approach\n\nthrough environmental education on grassroots and\n\ncommunity-based interventions. The Environmental Impact\n\nAssessment Approach is another avenue for policy planning,\n\nwhich integrates policy appraisal and supports sustainable de-\n\nvelopment more than the sectoral appraisal system. This ap-\n\nproach provides rational and quality information for decision-\n\nmaking. Integrated Sustainability Assessment approach for\n\nsustainable development policymaking is participatory and\n\nbased on a participatory cyclic process of scoping,\n\nenvisioning, experimenting, and learning through the shared\n\ninterpretation of sustainability; it helps to develop and apply in\n\nan integrated manner in the context (Whitmarsh et al. 2009).\n\nEvidence-based policymaking is another approach, but as\n\nthe perspective of business sectors and its context complicates\n\nthe application of this approach (Jasanoff 200\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant",
