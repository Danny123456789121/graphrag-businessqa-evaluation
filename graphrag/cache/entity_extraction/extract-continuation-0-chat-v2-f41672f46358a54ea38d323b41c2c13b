The gap between policy and its implementation causes failures of the sustainability policy. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of the present study is to explore the factors that create hurdles in the implementation of corporate sustainability policy in letters and spirits. The study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) approach and reviews all the possible studies from 1950 to 2019 published by six major publishing houses. These studies were found using selected keywords. The findings of SLR reveal governance, education, and SMEs as frequently appearing words while exploring corporate sustainability. The stakeholder theory and the institutional theory appear as the most cited theories in the sustainability literature. The grassroots approach, environmental impact assessment, integrated sustainability assessment, evidence-based practice approach, systematic approach, economical instrument policy approach, and consultant services approach appear as the most relevant approaches used for policymaking in corporate sustainability. The SLR findings reveal five significant factors that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation and can cause the gap between policy and its implementation. These factors are government institutions (including macro and meso-institutions), internal and external stakeholders, management, organizational barriers, and normative references.\n\n# Keywords\n\nCorporate sustainability . Systematic literature review . Policy . Practice . Implementation gap . Stakeholders\n\n# Introduction\n\nCorporate sustainability (CS) has become a part of the business community’s vernacular worldwide. The origin of the CS concept is mainly linked to the Brundtland report (1987), which incorporates CS through the triple bottom line of long-term economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility into a company’s management and operations (Bansal 2005). Despite the effective policymaking on CS, its implementation is frequently questioned. Since the policymaking and implementation are two different realms (Galbreath 2009), both aspects need to be equally reinforced for productive results. Kotler (2001) mentioned that the policy’s implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organization’s objectives. Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation is one of the core reasons for sustainability policy’s failure. Further, since the policies are written documents, these cannot be implemented in the real organizational setting without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication down the line to the implementation team (Ménard et al. 2018).\n\nOrganizational policies for long-term growth give an apex position to sustainability (Perrini and Minoja 2008). The reason for the importance of CS in decision-making can be traced back to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, S. W. S 1987). The report titled “Our\n\nCommon Future considers sustainability as the key driver for the prosperous global future for present and future generations. The report strongly suggests the corporate sector to focus on sustainable policies to meet the need of the present generation without harming future generations’ ability to meet their own needs.\n\nThe challenges to corporate sustainability are continual and require exploring new sustainable approaches (Alexander 2020) to overcome them (Raja et al. 2019). Especially at the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) level, it is crucial to see as to why the execution of policy remains a dilemma. Whether these are internal capabilities of a firm like dependability, flexibility, and future technology improvement (Caldera et al. 2019) or the external factors like governmental laws and regulations that affect an SMEs’ sustainability (Kumar and Saravanan 2017; Yang and Ha-Brookshire 2019). It requires a comprehensive review of the sustainability research to explore factors that play an intermittent role between formulated policies and their implementation. This way may provide plausible solutions to tackle the intermittent factors which cause damages to sustainability policy (Fischer et al. 2020; Jang 2020).\n\nSustainability encompasses three dimensions. First, organizations need to become socially responsible, the second organization needs to be environmentally friendly, and third, the organizations should create wealth for the shareholder. In this context, CS practices can simultaneously create benefits for society and profit maximization for shareholders in an environmentally driven business situation (Al Am 2016; Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013). Furthermore, CS practices also better all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, contractors, community members, positive impact on the environment, and shareholder value maximization (Miska et al. 2018). Hence these practices improve reputation, reliability, and good relationship with stakeholders (Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013; Moktadir et al. 2018).\n\nThere are a thousand of initiatives practiced by private organizations for societal and environmental improvement. International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) (n.d.-a, b), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are among those who provide generic guidelines and are recognized by the governments and implementing in their countries according to their need and priority (Klettner et al. 2014). Despite having extensive policy frameworks to ensure sustainable corporate practices, their implementation is grossly missing. According to crude estimates, a few percent of the businesses truly execute the CS policies. Many organizations do greenwashing by showing some charity and environmental driven steps (Ramus and Montiel 2005). It raises a serious question of whether the CS policies are overambitious\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MUSHTAQ AHMED<|>PERSON<|>Mushtaq Ahmed is one of the authors of the study on corporate sustainability policy implementation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUHAMMAD SHUJAAT MUBARIK<|>PERSON<|>Muhammad Shujaat Mubarik is one of the authors of the study on corporate sustainability policy implementation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUHAMMAD SHAHBAZ<|>PERSON<|>Muhammad Shahbaz is one of the authors of the study on corporate sustainability policy implementation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Springer-Verlag GmbH is the publisher of the study on corporate sustainability policy implementation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY<|>EVENT<|>Corporate sustainability policy refers to the strategies and practices that organizations implement to ensure long-term economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW<|>EVENT<|>The systematic literature review is a method used in the study to analyze existing research on corporate sustainability policy from 1950 to 2019.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Labour Organization (ILO) provides guidelines for sustainable corporate practices recognized by governments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) offers frameworks for corporate sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides guidelines for organizations to report on sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) offers guidelines for sustainable practices recognized by governments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSHTAQ AHMED<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH<|>Mushtaq Ahmed is an author of the study published by Springer-Verlag GmbH<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUHAMMAD SHUJAAT MUBARIK<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH<|>Muhammad Shujaat Mubarik is an author of the study published by Springer-Verlag GmbH<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUHAMMAD SHAHBAZ<|>SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH<|>Muhammad Shahbaz is an author of the study published by Springer-Verlag GmbH<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY<|>SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW<|>The systematic literature review analyzes factors affecting the implementation of corporate sustainability policy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY<|>The ILO provides guidelines that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY<|>The UNGC provides frameworks that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY<|>The GRI provides guidelines that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY<|>The OECD provides guidelines that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
