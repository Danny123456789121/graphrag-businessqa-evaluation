These might very well perceive the absolute amount of donations made by companies, but setting these donation amounts in relation to total firm resources seems to be beyond the means of the average customer. Following this line of thought, large amounts of charitable donations can cause large amounts of positive public attention and can hence generate a positive CFP impact on the same level as generosity in terms of relative donations. Finally, supporting the idea of an inverted u-shaped relationship between CP and CFP, a quite small sample indicates that initial participation in CP activities might have a stronger impact on CFP than ever increasing donations.\n\nWith regard to the donation medium included in the CP measurement (RQ3c), and contrary to our expectations, results indicated that the inclusion of in-kind donations did yield less business benefits compared to the donation of only cash. A possible explanation for this finding could be that managerial opportunism, i.e. agency costs, are a greater problem with in-kind donations because they are less controlled than philanthropic cash flows. In this context, management control boundary systems might play a crucial role in directing donations according to the company’s purposes (Simons 1994). Moreover, stakeholders might perceive cash donations to community purposes as more genuine compared to in-kind donations of company products.\n\nWhile a positive relationship was empirically shown for studies investigating continuous CP efforts, the subgroup of studies exploring disaster relief donations did not show a significant relationship (RQ3d). A reason for the fact that the positive relationship does not hold for effect sizes which measured disaster relief donations might be that most of the studies in this subsample focused on stock market values a few days after the incident. Medium and long-term effects of CP cannot adequately be captured by this approach, which is why no significant relationship was found.\n\nWith regard to the country where the data was gathered, results did not confirm that in developed countries (i.e. the USA) the relationship between CP and CFP was significantly different from the found relationship in developing countries (i.e. China; RQ3e). However, while in the USA the relationship was significantly positive, in China it was not, mainly due to the great heterogeneity of integrated effect sizes from Chinese samples. A possible explanation for the wide range of results.\n\n# F. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nfor China could be that within the country there exist regions with large differences regarding their degrees of development, respective CSR expectations, and market inefficiencies (Su and He 2010; Wang and Qian 2011). Furthermore, state or private ownership of companies might play an important role for the wide spread of results for China (Zhang et al. 2010; Qiu 2013) as agency costs might be greater for companies with state affiliations because managers make donations to increase their personal standing instead of company value (Jia and Zhang 2014). Filtering the studies according to their time of data acquisition showed that a significant positive relationship could only be assessed for the last decade, which supports the assumption that the relationship has strengthened over time (RQ3f). Still, in the context of this finding it should be considered that the majority of empirical research was based on data from the decade 2000–2010 and very little data was available on previous decades.\n\n# RQ4—methodological moderators\n\nNot to include the influence of moderating variables into such an analysis could easily compromise the validity of any findings (McWilliams and Siegel 2000). To eliminate the upward bias derived from CP-correlated variables which also influence CFP, such as advertising intensity or firm size, the effect of these variables can be controlled by partial correlations. It was found that, when only partial instead of bivariate correlations were analyzed, the relationship between CP and subsequent CFP was still significantly positive (RQ4a). However, we found mixed results when different control variables were considered individually (RQ4b–f). The relationships of the subgroups of studies that controlled for firm size, industry effects, or past financial performance, although remaining positive, were no longer significant. To resolve doubts concerning this matter, future research should always include the mentioned control variables into the analysis.\n\nSumming up our meta-analysis results, the following can be stated. Regarding the recent suggestions of Schaltegger and Burritt (2015) and arguments of agency theory, no evidence was found suggesting that CP would mainly inflict costs and, as a consequence, negatively influence CFP. On the contrary, a statistically significant positive relationship between CP and subsequent CFP was found, which allows for the interpretation of a causal effect of CP on CFP. Additionally, this positive effect was found to hold for the majority of study designs that were used for its investigation. Although the relationship was not significantly positive for every subgroup analyzed, there was not a single case in which a negative relationship was found. Thus, we could identify no particular context in which CP would harm a company’s financial situation, but often found evidence for the opposite justifying a stronger attention to CP in the context of management control systems.\n\n# 5.2 Limitations and further research\n\nThe goal of this study was to provide empirical evidence for the existence of a causal relationship between CP and CFP and only time-lagged measurements were valid for this purpose (Mitchell and James 2001). Although the inclusion of concurrent relationships, which in all cases supported our results, would have considerably enlarged our sample size, research questions were answered based only on observations which\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\nhad introduced a time lag into their study designs. As a consequence, significant statistical relationships were found which allowed inferring a positive effect of CP on CFP. We encourage future research to construct their methodological design according to the intended findings and to employ time-lagged variables when investigating causal relationships.
