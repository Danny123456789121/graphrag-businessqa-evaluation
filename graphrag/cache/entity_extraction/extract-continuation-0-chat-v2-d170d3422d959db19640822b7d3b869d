We thus predict that the association between board independence and the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is intensified for financially-motivated activists than socially-motivated activists. Stated formally:\n\n# Hypothesis 2b.\n\nThe effect of existing levels of board independence on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.\n\n# The Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism\n\nThe effectiveness of shareholder activism has received considerable attention in the literature, and findings regarding their effectiveness are mixed. A shareholder proposal can either be withdrawn by the activist if a concession is made by management, or can go to a shareholder vote if no concession is made. For proposals that are withdrawn, there is the risk that management has merely made a symbolic offer or paid “lip service” to temporarily placate the activist (Landier & Nair, 2009). For proposals that go to a vote by shareholders at the annual general meeting, the resulting vote is nonbinding, and therefore proposals resulting in a majority vote do not necessarily result in action by management. Therefore, the effectiveness of activists is by no means a foregone conclusion. On the other hand, a majority vote can send a strong signal to management, spurring them to action.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nEarly studies conclude that there is little evidence that shareholder proposals create value and that they have only a limited impact on firm governance structures (Karpoff, 2001), but some of the more recent studies document that shareholder proposals are having an impact (Goranova & Ryan, 2014; Aguilera et al., 2015). Thomas and Cotter (2007) find that seven percent of shareholder proposals filed between 2002 and 2004 on governance issues such as executive compensation and corporate control are adopted by the board. Ertimur, Ferri, and Stubben (2010) find that proposals that receive a majority vote are more likely to be adopted, especially in more recent years. They report that 22.4 percent of majority-vote proposals are adopted in 1997-2001, but that this frequency increases to 36.9 percent over 2002-2004. However, this still represents a small fraction of proposals filed, as only 18.0 percent and 31.7 percent of proposals receive majority-votes during those respective time periods. Ertimur et al. (2010) also report that proposals related to board composition have the lowest rates of implementation, following shareholder rights and executive pay.\n\nWith particular regard to proposals related to environmental/social issues, Reid and Toffel (2009) find that firms are more likely to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project if they are targeted by environmental shareholder proposals. In contrast, David, Bloom, & Hillman (2007) find that corporate social performance proposals are negatively related to subsequent corporate social performance.\n\nHowever, given the more recent evidence on the growing effectiveness of shareholder activism and the increased attention on gender diversity issues, we expect proposals to have some measurable impact on female board representation. Stated formally:\n\n# Hypothesis 3a.\n\nThere is a significant increase in female board representation after a firm has been targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity.\n\nAs with H1 and H2, we again consider how activist motivations might affect our prediction. Gillan and Starks (2000) find that proposals sponsored by institutional investors received significantly more favorable votes than those sponsored by independent individuals.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nor religious organizations. Similarly, Renneboog and Szilagyi (2009) find that proposals submitted by public pension funds and investment firms garner the most votes compared to unions, religious groups and individual investors. Ertimur et al. (2010) report that proposals initiated by religious organizations have the lowest majority-vote and implementation rates relative to other activist types.\n\nAs we discuss below, we categorize public pension funds and investment firms as financially-motivated, and religious groups and individuals as socially-motivated. To the extent that weak voting support represents a misalignment of activist interest to the interests of the average firm shareholder (Gillan & Starks, 2007), we would expect proposals by the socially-motivated investor groups to be less effective in changing management behavior. Further, if financially-motivated activists do target firms with lower female representation, as predicted in Hypothesis 1b, management may feel greater pressure to improve performance on this dimension. We therefore predict the following:\n\n# Hypothesis 3b.\n\nThe increase in female board representation after a firm has been targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is lower (higher) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.\n\n# RESEARCH METHOD\n\nDetails of our sample selection process are reported in Table 1. We obtain 182 shareholder proposals related to board diversity for S&P 1500 firms over the 1997-2011 period from RiskMetrics. Ending our sample period in 2011 allows us to analyze subsequent board appointments for two years following the target year. We consider both proposals that went to vote (64) and those that did not (118). Proposals may be withdrawn for two primary reasons: they may be omitted or withdrawn. Omitted proposals result when the SEC grants exclusion of the proposal because of ineligibility (typically if the proposal is vague, false or misleading, the proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations, the proposal...\n\nis contrary to applicable law, a duplicate proposal exists, or on procedural grounds such as the defects in the shareholder’s proof of ownership. A proposal is withdrawn by the submitting shareholder when the firm\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>EVENT<|>Shareholder activism refers to the efforts of shareholders to influence a corporation's behavior by exercising their rights as owners.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>EVENT<|>Gender diversity in corporate boards refers to the representation of women on the boards of directors of companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISKMETRICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RiskMetrics is a firm that provides governance and risk management data, including information on shareholder proposals related to board diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S&P 1500<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The S&P 1500 is a stock market index that includes 1500 of the largest companies in the U.S., used for analyzing shareholder proposals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARPOFF<|>PERSON<|>Karpoff is a researcher who has studied the impact of shareholder proposals on firm governance structures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILAN AND STARKS<|>PERSON<|>Gillan and Starks are researchers who have analyzed the effectiveness of shareholder proposals and the motivations behind them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERTIMUR<|>PERSON<|>Ertimur is a researcher who has reported on the rates of implementation of shareholder proposals and their effectiveness.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>Shareholder activism often targets issues of gender diversity in corporate boards, aiming to increase female representation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISKMETRICS<|>S&P 1500<|>RiskMetrics provides data on shareholder proposals related to board diversity for companies in the S&P 1500<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARPOFF<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>Karpoff has conducted studies on the effectiveness of shareholder activism and its impact on governance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILAN AND STARKS<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>Gillan and Starks have researched the motivations behind shareholder activism and its effectiveness<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERTIMUR<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>Ertimur has analyzed the implementation rates of shareholder proposals, contributing to the understanding of shareholder activism<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
