When we disaggregate by investor categories (mutual funds, insurance companies, banks, pension funds, and hedge funds), we find that insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds are underweight scope 1 emission intensity. The negative ownership effect of moving from high to low scope 1 emission-intensity firms is economically large and accounts for about 15%-20% of the cross-sectional variation in the ownership variable. This finding is in line with the rise in the sustainable investment movement and the popular negative exclusionary screening investment strategy followed by funds with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) tilt.\n\nWe find that divestment is only based on scope 1 emission intensity. This is true both in aggregate and for each institutional investor category. Essentially, institutional investors have been applying exclusionary screens (or not) solely on the basis of scope 1 emission intensity. Even more remarkable, we find that when we exclude the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil & gas, utilities, and motor industries), there is no significant exclusionary screening at all by institutional investors. In other words, the exclusionary screening is done entirely in these salient industries; in all other industries, there is no significant divestment. Overall, these findings lead us to reject the divestment hypothesis. First, although there is significant divestment by institutional investors, it is not directly linked to an effect on stock returns. Institutional investor portfolios are significantly underweight firms with high scope 1 emission intensity, but stock returns are not affected significantly by emission intensity.\n\nSee Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020). Also, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review 2018, negative/exclusionary screening is the largest sustainable investment strategy globally, representing $19.8 trillion of assets under management. http://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSIR_Review2018.3.28.pdf.\n\nOur finding that stock returns are positively related to the level (and changes) of carbon emissions is largely consistent with the view that investors are pricing in a carbon risk premium at the firm level. This result contradicts the carbon alpha hypothesis, whereby investors holding a portfolio long stocks of companies with low carbon emissions and short stocks of companies with high emissions generates positive abnormal returns. Garvey, Iyer, and Nash (2018) and In, Park, and Monk (2019) suggest that portfolios that sort stocks by emission intensity (going long stocks with low intensity and short stocks with high intensity) generate a positive alpha. In contrast, we find that there is no significant effect of carbon intensity on stock returns. Our study differs in two important respects from theirs. First, we cover a different time period and sample of firms. Second, we control for industry, firm characteristics, and known risk factors, while neither of these studies includes all of these controls. Controlling for industry significantly affects the results. Also, in contrast to In, Park, and Monk (2019), we analyze the effects of carbon emissions for each scope category separately, thereby avoiding double counting.\n\nAnother important finding is that the carbon premium has only materialized recently. We show that if we look back to the 1990s by imputing the 2005 cross-sectional distribution of total emissions to the 1990s, there is no significant carbon premium, consistent with the view that investors at that time likely did not pay as much attention to carbon emissions. However, if we apply the same analysis to our sample period, by imputing the 2017 cross-sectional distribution of emissions back throughout our sample period, we find that there is a highly significant carbon premium.\n\nTo summarize, investors seem to take a somewhat schizophrenic attitude to carbon emissions. On the one hand, institutional investors clearly want to take a proactive approach by divesting from industries with high CO2 emissions. On the other hand, this categorical exclusionary screening approach only partially addresses the carbon risk issue. Indeed, investors price in a carbon emission risk premium at the firm level in all industries even though divestment is concentrated in the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil & gas, utilities, and transportation industries). If there is one general lesson that emerges from our analysis it is that carbon risk cannot just be reduced to a fossil fuel supply problem. It is also a demand problem. Once one factors in both the supply and demand aspects, all companies in all sectors are exposed to various degrees to carbon emissions risk. A coarse exclusionary approach focusing only on the energy and utility sectors misses the full extent of the problem investors face. Accounting for carbon risk is also required on the demand side, which inevitably involves the careful tracking of emissions at the firm level in all sectors.\n\nOur study is related to a rapidly growing literature on climate change and financial markets. An early study by Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera‐Munoz (2014) of S&P 500 firms between 2006 and 2008 looks at the effects of direct carbon emissions on firm value, and the effects of voluntary public disclosure of emissions (through CDP) on firm value. They find that higher emissions are associated with lower firm values, but that voluntary disclosure mitigates the negative valuation effect of emissions. Relatedly, Chava (2014) looks at the effects of environmental concerns, as reflected in KLD ratings, on firms’ cost of capital. He finds that firms that derive substantial revenues from the sale of coal or oil, as reflected in a KLD rating, are associated with a higher implied cost of capital. In an extensive survey of institutional investors, Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020) also find that institutional investors believe that carbon emissions represent a material\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institutional investors are entities that invest on behalf of others, such as mutual funds, insurance companies, banks, pension funds, and hedge funds, and they are involved in the sustainable investment movement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT MOVEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The sustainable investment movement focuses on investing in companies that adhere to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, promoting responsible investment practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUTUAL FUNDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mutual funds are investment programs funded by shareholders that trade in diversified holdings and are managed by professionals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSURANCE COMPANIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Insurance companies provide coverage against financial loss and are involved in investment activities, including sustainable investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENSION FUNDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pension funds are investment pools that collect and invest money to provide retirement income for employees.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEDGE FUNDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hedge funds are investment funds that employ various strategies to earn active returns for their investors, often involving high-risk investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CO2 EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>CO2 emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a significant factor in climate change and is monitored by investors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON RISK PREMIUM<|>EVENT<|>The carbon risk premium is the additional return that investors require for taking on the risk associated with carbon emissions and climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON EMISSION RISK<|>EVENT<|>Carbon emission risk refers to the financial risks associated with the potential impact of carbon emissions on investments and company valuations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSI ALLIANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The GSI Alliance is an organization that focuses on promoting sustainable investment practices and provides resources such as the Global Sustainable Investment Review.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT REVIEW 2018<|>EVENT<|>The Global Sustainable Investment Review 2018 is a report that outlines trends and statistics in sustainable investment practices globally.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT MOVEMENT<|>Institutional investors are key players in the sustainable investment movement, applying exclusionary screens based on ESG criteria.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUTUAL FUNDS<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Mutual funds are a category of institutional investors that manage investments on behalf of shareholders.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSURANCE COMPANIES<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Insurance companies are a type of institutional investor that also engages in sustainable investment practices.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PENSION FUNDS<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Pension funds are another category of institutional investors that invest for the benefit of employees' retirement.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEDGE FUNDS<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Hedge funds are part of the institutional investor landscape, often employing high-risk strategies.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CO2 EMISSIONS<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Institutional investors monitor CO2 emissions to assess investment risks and apply exclusionary screening.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON RISK PREMIUM<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Institutional investors price in a carbon risk premium when evaluating investments based on carbon emissions.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON EMISSION RISK<|>INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS<|>Institutional investors are concerned with carbon emission risk as it affects their investment strategies and returns.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSI ALLIANCE<|>GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT REVIEW 2018<|>The GSI Alliance published the Global Sustainable Investment Review 2018, which provides insights into sustainable investment trends.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
