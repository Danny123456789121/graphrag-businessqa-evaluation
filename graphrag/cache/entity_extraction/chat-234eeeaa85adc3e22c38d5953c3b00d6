For example, if one measurement subgroup were found to contain many studies with very small sample sizes, this subgroup would show a relatively large random sampling error. Thus, differences in sampling error across measurement subgroups may explain CSP/CFP correlational differences in primary studies. In addition, measurement error of CFP and CSP (that is, unreliability) might act as another artefactual source of cross-study variability in correlations. If, for example, CSP disclosure measures were plagued by comparatively low psychometric quality (for example, Abbott and Monsen 1979; Ingram and Frazier 1980; Wiseman 1982), observed correlations between CSP disclosures and CFP would be systematically lower than the correlations between CFP and other, more reliable measures of CSP. Therefore, this meta-analysis hierarchically breaks down the overall data set in order to compare the relative magnitudes of correlations arising from different CSP and CFP measurement subcategories, and to test for these three possible sources of cross-study variation of correlations (substantive differences, sampling error, and measurement error). We hypothesize that:\n\n# H4a:\n\nA large proportion of cross-study variance is due to statistical or methodological artefacts (sampling error and measurement error).\n\n# H4b:\n\nConsistent with stakeholder mismatching, after accounting for statistical artefacts, there will still be differences in the statistical associations between different sub-dimensions of CFP and CSP (after correct matching).\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Organization Studies 24(3)\n\n# Figure 1\n\n# Hypothesized Relationships (H)\n\n|CSP| |CFP|\n|---|---|---|\n|H4a|Artefacts|H4b|\n|Measurement Strategies| | |\n|Competencies, Learning, and Efficiency|H3a| |\n|CSP| |CFP|\n|Reputation-Building|H3b| |\n\nNote: CSP = corporate social performance; CFP = corporate financial performance.\n\n# Methods\n\nPrior summaries of the CSP–CFP literature have relied mostly on narrative reviews (for example, Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985) or the vote-counting method of aggregation (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995). Narrative reviews are literature reviews that attempt to make sense of past findings verbally or conceptually. The vote-counting method refers to the cumulation of significance levels or, in the simplest case, to the tabulation of significant and non-significant findings (Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Light and Smith 1971). Both of these research integration techniques tend to draw false inferences because they do not correct for sampling and measurement error, two important study artefacts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In fact, the statistical errors in the typical ‘vote-counting’ literature review tend to be more serious than in the average narrative review because the statistical power of the vote-counting procedure decreases with increasing.\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nnumber of studies reviewed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Although we have known for more than 20 years that vote counting is marred by a lack of validity, the technique is still widely used today (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995).\n\nIn contrast, effect-size (r) meta-analysis is a rigorous approach to external validation, which calculates population parameter estimates (ρ) by correcting for the aforementioned artefacts. The effect of sampling error is important because sample sizes that are smaller than the population cause observed sample correlation statistics r to vary randomly from the population parameter, the true-score correlation ρ. In addition, as mentioned before, measurement error (that is, unreliability) systematically attenuates observed correlations (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994).\n\n# Search for Relevant Studies\n\nComputer searches of ABI/Inform Global and PsycINFO were conducted, using the keyword search ‘organizational effectiveness and corporate social performance’. Synonyms for the former, used in separate computer searches, were ‘organizational performance’, ‘profitability’, ‘economic success’, and ‘financial performance’. ‘Corporate social performance’ as a keyword search term was alternately substituted with ‘(corporate) social responsibility’, ‘corporate environmental performance’, ‘responsiveness’, and simply ‘resp?’. ABI/Inform Global gives access to the full text and images of more than 1,200 US and international business and trade journal articles (1970-current), while PsycINFO indexes abstracts of journal articles and book chapters in psychology starting in 1974. To increase the scope of our search, cross-citations from previous narrative reviews (for example, Aldag and Bartol 1978; McGuire et al. 1988: 857 –860; Preston 1978a; Waddock and Mahon 1991; Wood and Jones 1995) were explored as well.\n\n# Criteria for Relevance\n\nThe studies that were deemed relevant for the meta-analysis had the following characteristics. First, the studies quantitatively examined the relationship between CSP and CFP.
