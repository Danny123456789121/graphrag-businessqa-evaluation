The studies’ results based on data from advanced economies yield stronger effect sizes than those obtained from developing economies (r = .0404 vs. r = .0175, respectively). Meanwhile, the statistical power is different between the developed and developing countries. For the studies based in the developing countries, the p value is significant at the level of .1. However, it is significant at the level of .001 for the samples from the developed countries. Therefore, Hypothesis 5 is supported (see Table 4).\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe relationship between CSR and CFP has been extensively studied in strategic and organizational management, yet the empirical findings on its importance have been noticeably mixed. The authors conducted a meta-analytic review to seek to clarify this issue. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives regarding instrumental stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory, this study reviews the linkage of CSR–CFP at the organizational level and answers the following questions: (a) whether CSR is positively linked to financial performance; (b) and if so, in what direction does the causation run; and (c) whether methodological and contextual heterogeneities moderate CSR–CFP linkage.\n\nThe results of this study make several contributions to the literature on the value of CSR. First, based on 42 studies and 119 effect sizes, an integration correlation revealed a positive association of CSR–CFP linkage, thus answering positively the question: Do firms “do well by doing good”? This question has been invoked as the primary concern of the management literature on CSR (McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright 2006). Showing that a firm does well by doing good is often referred to as making the business case for CSR (McWilliams & Siegel, 2006). Therefore, understanding whether CSR is effective in facilitating organizational performance is not only important to researchers but also financially meaningful to practitioners who have been practicing or are being advised to practice social involvement. As a compilation of previous findings cannot produce a definitive conclusion, Margolis and Walsh (2003) argued that “the CSP-CFP empirical literature reinforces, rather than relieves the tension surrounding corporate responses to social misery” (p. 278). The findings drawn from this meta-analysis thus provide some indication that prior literature, in aggregate, indicates a positive relationship between CSR and CFP, which is supposed to be beneficial to clarifying the mystery.\n\n# Moderating Effects of Environmental Context\n\n|95% CI|[0.00, 0.04]|[0.03, 0.06]|\n|---|---|---|\n|p|<.0001|0.0850|\n|z|6.9692|1.7224|\n|SE|0.0058|0.0101|\n|r Corrected|0.0404***|0.0175*|\n|Total sample size|(100,218)|(100,218)|\n|N|20,904|20,904|\n|Number of effect sizes|(44)|(44)|\n|1.

There are many factors, found in the past 30 years of research, potentially influencing a firm’s social involvement. Without a comprehensive consideration of those factors, it may be hard to say that any one of them, such as financial performance, positively caused subsequent CSR. As stated above, the study results did not support the slack resource theory, which assumed that firms with good prior financial performance would be associated with a higher degree of subsequent social responsibility. The authors believe that this result may be related to the diverse and complex predictions determining companies’ social responsibility. For the past 30 years of research, a great number of scholars have discussed, from exogenous and endogenous perspectives, the antecedents of CSR. Government requirements, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), developing status, and social security are viewed as external antecedents of social-level factors. One source of endogenous influences are firm-level factors, such as CFP (Aupperle et al., 1985; McGuire et al., 1988; Moskowitz, 1972), firm strategy (Berman et al., 1999), business exposure (Miles, 1987), political participation level (Wu, 2006), and institutional ownership (Hansen & Hill, 1991). Another type of endogenous factor focuses on the individual factors, for instance, managers’ demographic characteristics, managerial value, and CEO power (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1987; Hambrick & Mason, 1984).\n\nThis viewpoint gets support to a certain extent from Mishina, Dykes, Block, and Pollock (2010). Arguing that “good firms do bad things,” they found that high firm accounting performance is positively related to the likelihood that a firm engages in corporate illegality, and this likelihood being due to a lot of pressure to maintain high relative performance that may induce risk-seeking behaviors. Recent history illustrates the complexity of this issue. Many of the firms involved in corporate scandals, such as Arthur Andersen, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and several leading investment banks, were generally viewed as high-performing companies until their scandals were uncovered (Mishina et al., 2010).\n\nThird, this study also contributes to the literature on CSR by demonstrating how measurement strategy and environmental context may explain the heterogeneity of CSR–CFP linkage. The meta-analytic correlations indicate that the association between CSR and CFP depends\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WANG ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Wang et al. refers to the authors of the study discussing the relationship between CSR and CFP)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) refers to a company's financial health and profitability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPED ECONOMIES<|>GEO<|>Developed economies are countries with high levels of income per capita and advanced technological infrastructure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPING ECONOMIES<|>GEO<|>Developing economies are countries with lower income levels and less advanced technological infrastructure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGOLIS AND WALSH<|>PERSON<|>Margolis and Walsh are researchers who discussed the empirical literature on the relationship between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTHUR ANDERSEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arthur Andersen was an accounting firm that was involved in one of the largest corporate scandals in history)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Enron was an American energy company that became infamous for its accounting fraud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tyco International was a multinational corporation that was involved in a major financial scandal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLDCOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WorldCom was a telecommunications company that was involved in a massive accounting scandal)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Wang et al. conducted a study analyzing the relationship between CSR and CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG ET AL.<|>CFP<|>Wang et al. conducted a study analyzing the relationship between CSR and CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>The study indicates a positive association between CSR and CFP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGOLIS AND WALSH<|>CSR<|>Margolis and Walsh discussed the empirical literature on CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGOLIS AND WALSH<|>CFP<|>Margolis and Walsh discussed the empirical literature on CFP<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTHUR ANDERSEN<|>CSR<|>Arthur Andersen's scandal illustrates the complexities of CSR and its impact on corporate reputation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENRON<|>CSR<|>Enron's scandal illustrates the complexities of CSR and its impact on corporate reputation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYCO<|>CSR<|>Tyco's scandal illustrates the complexities of CSR and its impact on corporate reputation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLDCOM<|>CSR<|>WorldCom's scandal illustrates the complexities of CSR and its impact on corporate reputation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPED ECONOMIES<|>CSR<|>The study indicates that CSR practices may vary significantly between developed and developing economies<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPING ECONOMIES<|>CSR<|>The study indicates that CSR practices may vary significantly between developed and developing economies<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
