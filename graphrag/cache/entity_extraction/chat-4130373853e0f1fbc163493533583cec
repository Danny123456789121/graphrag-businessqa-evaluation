Moreover, as proposed, the relationship is stronger for proactive CEP (r = .138, k = 72, N = 54,361, p < .001) than for reactive CEP (r = .072, k = 48, N = 44,170, p = .001). It is worth mentioning, that we were not able to unambiguously assign all effect sizes to the categories of proactive or reactive. Therefore, the sum of the effect sizes of both subgroups (k = 120) is smaller than the overall number of effect sizes (k = 245).\n\nIt should be noted that overall the summary effects we found are small by conventional standards (Cohen, 1992), implying that the magnitude of relationship between CEP and CFP is rather modest. However, Aguinis et al. (2011) showed that meta-analyses in management research commonly yield rather weak summary effects in terms of magnitude.\n\n# Partial HOMA\n\nTable 3 reports the results of the partial HOMA. The partial correlation-based summary effect is smaller compared to that based on product–moment correlations (rxy.z = .083, k = 208, N = 179,318, p < .001). The 95% confidence interval ranges from .066 to .100, not including zero. That means that even if the effects\n\n**Results of the partial HOMA.**\n|Study characteristics|k|N|r xy.z|95% CI|Q|QB|p|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Overall relationship between CEP and CFP|208|179,318|.083***|.066|.100|2133.051***|.000|\n|Control variables| | | | | | | |\n|Firm size controlled|180|142,459|.081***|.062|.100| |.000|\n|Firm size not controlled|28|36,859|.081***|.050|.111| |.000|\n|Type of industry controlled|147|114,786|.090***|.069|.110| |.000|\n|Type of industry not controlled|61|64,532|.061***|.032|.090| |.000|\n|Financial risk controlled|98|98,791|.049***|.025|.072| |.000|\n|Financial risk not controlled|110|80,527|.113***|.089|.137| |.000|\n|R&D intensity controlled|38|34,428|.115***|.074|.157| |.000|\n|R&D intensity not controlled|170|144,890|.073***|.054|.091| |.000|\n|Advertising intensity controlled|20|12,832|.120***|.070|.170| |.000|\n|Advertising intensity not controlled|188|166,486|.076***|.059|.094| |.000|\n|Capital intensity controlled|32|47,398|.075***|.039|.110| |.000|\n|Capital intensity not controlled|176|131,920|.082***|.063|.101| |.000|\n|Endogeneity| | | | | | | |\n|Endogeneity addressed|58|82,942|.027*|.006|.047| |.011|\n|Endogeneity not addressed|150|96,376|.107***|.085|.129| |.000|\n|Type of sample| | | | | | | |\n|Cross-sectional sample|135|127,689|.063***|.042|.084| |.000|\n|Single-industry sample|73|51,629|.115***|.088|.141| |.000|\n|Timing of research| | | | | | | |\n|Until 1997|28|21,270|.117***|.067|.167| |.000|\n|After 1997|180|158,048|.076***|.059|.093| |.000|\n\n*Note: H = hypothesis, k = number of effect sizes, N = total sample size, r xy.z = mean partial correlation, CI = confidence interval, Q = Q statistic, Q B = between-group Q statistic.\n\np < .05.\n\n** p < .01.\n\n*** p < .001.\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al.
