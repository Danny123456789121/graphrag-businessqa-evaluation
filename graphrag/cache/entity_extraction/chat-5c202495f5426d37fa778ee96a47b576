So was socially irresponsible, but other arguments in the CSR literature although it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these three studies as a group; their existence indicates that it is at least possible to conduct event studies focused on socially responsible events. I believe that more such event studies are called for; and at some future date a meta-analysis of socially responsible behavior and its effects on shareholder wealth would be warranted.\n\nThe second question that future research needs to concern itself with is how the magnitude of the abnormal returns relates to the size of any costs absorbed by the firms. The theoretical literature suggests that the size of the abnormal returns ought to be tied closely to the size of the costs a company must pay to rectify a socially irresponsible act. Only eight of the event studies, however, tried to find a correlation between the size of the abnormal returns and the magnitude of remedial costs (e.g., court costs, damages, lost goodwill) firms incur. Five of these eight studies (Studies 9, 11, 14, 21, and 24 in Table 1) showed no systematic relationship between remedial costs and abnormal returns. One study (27), however, did find that the size of the abnormal returns correlated to the added costs of more stringent regulations that were passed in response to the irresponsible behavior: Two studies (5, 22) tested whether the magnitude of the penalty imposed by the market was related to the magnitude of the firms' irresponsible behavior and found that indeed the most irresponsible companies were penalized the most.\n\nClearly this is not enough evidence to conclude anything, and so correlating the size of the market penalty in dollar-per-share terms to the abnormal returns is something for all future CSR event studies to consider doing. A final question researchers still need to address is this: The market does appear to be reacting to the socially irresponsible and illicit behavior of firms in such a way that shareholder wealth decreases. If we were to think of this as a penalty absorbed by shareholders, we might ask whether the market is imposing the penalty in response to the socially irresponsible and illegal behavior of the firms (in which case the market's action would be ethical in nature), or whether it is imposing the penalty in response to the bad news and its potential to decrease expected future income streams (in which case the market's action would be economic in nature).\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nWhichever the answer turns out to be, though whether ethical or economic we can say that based on this meta-analysis, the shareholder wealth of firms engaging in socially irresponsible or illicit behavior is decreasing: In other words, even if we do not know why the shareholders are losing wealth, this meta-analysis shows that they are. And, as a result, we can still say that Proposition 3 holds true, that socially responsible and lawful behavior is necessary, though not sufficient; for shareholder wealth to be increased.\n\nSo despite the need for further research; this meta-analysis does indicate that socially responsible and illicit behavior is necessary (though not sufficient) to increase shareholder wealth, all other things equal. That the shareholder wealth of those firms engaging in irresponsible or illegal behavior does decrease finally gives economically self-interested firms a self-interested motive for being socially responsible and law abiding:\n\n# APPENDIX\n\n# Event Study Methodology\n\nEvent studies focus on a particular type of event—product recalls, for example—and try to determine whether the stock market responds to the news of the event; In other words, does anything \"abnormal\" happen to a company's stock when the company makes a recall? The theory underlying event studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, which argues that modern financial markets are information efficient. The markets can anticipate and correctly interpret news about a security and adjust the price of the security very quickly to reflect that news (Fama et al., 1969). Although most researchers agree now that financial markets are not \"information perfect\" in their performance, they do work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy (Holthausen, Leftwich, and Mayers, 1990). The methodology for event studies became standardized by the mid-1980s, before most of the CSR event studies meta-analyzed here had even been done. (This standardization served to facilitate this meta-analysis because it ensured that the results of the studies are roughly comparable, that is, homogeneous.)\n\nThis article includes only a brief summary of event study methodology that centers on the use of two key concepts: abnormal returns and average abnormal returns.\n\n# Abnormal Returns (ARs)\n\nAbnormal returns accrue when a stock outperforms the market. So when a stock earns significantly greater positive or negative returns than other stocks in the market, it is considered to have abnormal returns.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman MTA-ANALYSIS 245\n\nAccording to the market model and its equation for calculating abnormal returns, its risk class, it is earning abnormal returns. Abnormal returns can be computed (Fama et al, 1969). An abnormal return can be defined as:\n\nAbnormal Return = Actual Return - Expected Return,\n\nOr, in mathematical terms, as:\n\nARit = Rit - E(Ri),\n\nwhere ARit = the abnormal return for security i in time period t, Rit = the actual return for security i in time period t, and E(Ri) = the expected return for security i in time period t.\n\nIt should be noted here that E(ARi) = 0; that is, on average we expect a firm's abnormal returns to be zero - we expect nothing abnormal to be happening to a firm's returns (unless of course, as will be explained, something\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
