As studies controlling for ﬁnancial risk yield smaller relationships (rxy.z = .049, k = 98, N = 98,791, p < .001) than studies which do not control for this variable (rxy.z = .113, k = 110, N = 80,527, p < .001), this ﬁnding indicates that latter studies tend to show upwardly biased estimates of the focal relationship. Also, our ﬁndings suggested that studies controlling for possible endoge-\nneity (rxy.z = .027, k = 58, N = 82,942, p = .011) show weaker rela-\ntionships than studies not controlling for this issue (rxy.z = .107, k = 150, N = 96,376, p < .001) (QB = 27.726, p < .001). Furthermore, our results indicated that studies relying on single industry sam-\nples (rxy.z = .115, k = 73, N = 51,629, p < .001) tend to ﬁnd stronger relationships than studies drawing on cross-sectional samples (rxy.z = .063, k = 135, N = 127,689, p < .001) (Q B = 8.922, p = .003). Fi-\nnally, our ﬁndings suggested that the timing of research does not signiﬁcantly moderate the focal relationship (Q B = 2.402, p < .121).\n\n# Discussion\n\nIn conducting this study, we sought to address the widely de-\nplored lack of consensus regarding the CEP–CFP relationship. Our\nmain purposes were (1) to shed light on the direction of causality,\n(2) to account for the multidimensional nature of both constructs\nby disentangling the available empirical evidence with respect to\nthe constructs’ underlying dimensions, and (3) to explore whether\nmethodological artifacts provide possible explanations for the\ninconsistency of the ﬁndings yielded by empirical studies to date.\nOur ﬁndings enable us to provide solid ground for future research\non one of the most puzzling questions facing research on organiza-\ntions and the natural environment.\n\nWhile several scholars, on the basis of narrative reviews and\nvote counts, have noted that a general conclusion cannot be drawn\nor that ‘‘the only conclusion to be extracted is that empirical esti-\nmates report mixed results’’ (Blanco et al., 2009, p. 465), our study\nprovides evidence that, overall, the relationship is positive.\nAlthough the summary effects derived from our analyses are small\nin terms of magnitude, we can clearly reject the neo-classical argu-\nments for a trade-off between CEP and CFP. Furthermore, though\nour ﬁndings do not fully support the existence of a virtuous circle,\nour results indicate that the relationship involves some reciprocal\ncausal mechanisms. Finally, we identiﬁed moderation effects of\nseveral methodological artifacts, which to some extent provide\nreasons for the inconsistency of study ﬁndings. In the following\npassages, we expand on these and other issues that arise from\nour analysis.\n\nWhile most of the research on the relationship between CEP and\nCFP has been tied to the question of whether it pays to be green,\nmore recently, scholars have begun to challenge the assumption\nof an unidirectional relationship by introducing theoretical argu-\nments for a reverse direction or even a possible ‘‘two-way interac-\ntion’’ (Molina-Azorín et al., 2009, p. 1094) in terms of bidirectional\ncausality. Hence, we divided the complete sample of effect sizes in\nterms of the temporal sequence of measuring both constructs.\nWith regard to the causal link from CEP to CFP our ﬁndings prepon-\nderantly conﬁrm the arguments of the NRBV and the instrumental\nstakeholder theory. Outcome-based CEP is positively related to\nboth subsequent market-based and accounting-based CFP with a\nslightly stronger relationship for the latter dimension of CFP. First,\nthis means that the observable and quantiﬁable results of a ﬁrm’s\nenvironmental activities (i.e., outcome-based CEP) increase the\nﬁrm’s internal efﬁciency and have positive impacts on its tangible\ncosts and revenues (reﬂected by accounting-based measures). This\nﬁnding reinforces Porter and van der Linde’s (1995) assertion that\npollution is a sign of inefﬁciency and entails hidden costs. There-\nfore, reduced environmental impacts in terms of less waste or de-\ncreased levels of pollution are accompanied with short-term\nbenefits that may result from lower costs of raw materials (due\nto better utilization of inputs), reduced waste disposal costs, or\nlowered liability costs (Delmas et al., 2011; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Pe-\nloza, 2009; Shrivastava, 1995). Second, this indicates that out-\ncome-based CEP also positively inﬂuences external evaluations of\na ﬁrm and may entail reputational effects\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
