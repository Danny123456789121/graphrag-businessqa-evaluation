To achieve corporate sustainability, a company must strengthen its members’ GPPO and formulate a clear corporate GSV. The findings of this study have several theoretical implications.\n\n# 5.1. Theoretical Implications\n\nOur research provides three academic contributions to the sustainable development of green management in the field of psychology. First, the empirical results verified the hypothesis that expectancy–valence theory incorporates PO. When results meet people’s expectations, they receive additional investment and compensation, strengthening the PO’s degree [49, 94]. The aforementioned contribution expands the original expected value theory to fields such as topic teaching and learning for young children [94–97], unemployment issues [47, 98], and physical and mental health issues [99], which enables research gaps in the field of business management to be filled. Moreover, few studies have examined confusion issues from the perspective of employees. Therefore, this study used the views of PO theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV to fill an existing research gap. Second, the empirical results of the past GSV research literature found that GSV contributes to employee’s proenvironmental behavior [100], green product development performance [34, 101, 102], and organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35], especially focusing on employee behavior and product development performance. Finally, the study results indicate the effect of psychological process related to green issues on green management performance in an integrated conceptual framework. The expectation value theory and PO theory indicate that relationships exist among GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP. This finding expands the contribution of psychology to sustainable environmental development. This study also verified PO theory by examining the mediation effects of EGC and EEP on the relationship between GPPO and GSV. The results indicated that GSV enhances the degree of PO and positively affects GPPO. The research model expands the PO model and indicates that GSV is crucial for the formation of PO, reduces a company’s EGC, and improves a company’s EEP. Thus, GPPO is critical for corporate sustainability [35, 103].\n\n# 5.2. Practical Implications\n\nThe research findings can help Taiwanese companies promote environmental sustainability. These findings also provide a reference to other Asian companies seeking to perform green management. The research results indicate that a relationship exists between GSV and GPPO in psychological processes related to green issues. Moreover, the results indicate that an organization’s green management performance is affected by its EGC and EEP. This study indicates that EGC and EEP are caused by GSV and GPPO. GSV is positively correlated with EEP, GPPO is negatively correlated with EGC and positively correlated with EEP, and EGC is negatively correlated with EEP. The aforementioned results indicate that psychological processes related to green issues improve an organization’s green management performance. We found that employees’ EEP is affected by their EGC. Therefore, this study proposes several steps for corporate management to reduce EGC and promote EEP. First, the head of the enterprise management class should formulate a GSV, express the goals and aspirations of the company’s sustainable development, and regularly discuss and reflect on the amendments to the GSV. The development of a shared vision for the organization would improve organizational performance and motivate members to work toward organizational goal [29, 42, 63, 104, 105]. Thus, companies should use psychological processes related to green issues for verifying the execution results and adopt an active GSV strategy to create employee GPPO in their business models. By using the aforementioned strategy, companies can reduce employees’ EGC and improve their EEP. In particular, companies should formulate an environmental development blueprint and develop incentive plans to encourage their employees to participate in the design and production of environmental products. A good practice is for employees to participate in the production process of environmentally friendly.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\n# 5.3. Limitations and Future Research\n\nThis study has certain limitations. First, the data analysis results unexpectedly revealed that EGC has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between GSV and EEP. The findings of this study provide preliminary concepts that should be verified using relevant studies. Second, this study analyzes the perspectives of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory and discusses the environmental behavior and performance of organizational employees. Future research can go further and use other theories. For example, the value theory can further strengthen the relationship between Psychological Processes of Green Issues and Green Management Performance through the exploration of Costs and benefits or the expectancy theory. Third, all the research participants were from Taiwan. The universality of the study results may be limited by differences in the national conditions, cultures, industrial scenarios, and economic structures between different countries. Therefore, the results of this study can be verified by conducting research in other countries and regions, such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Finally, from the perspective of the company’s internal green management\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GSV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GSV is an organization involved in promoting green management and sustainability practices within companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPPO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPPO is an organization that focuses on enhancing employee engagement and performance related to green practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EGC refers to the environmental governance compliance that organizations must adhere to in their operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EEP stands for employee environmental performance, which measures how well employees contribute to environmental sustainability efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIWAN<|>GEO<|>Taiwan is a country where the study was conducted, focusing on corporate sustainability and green management practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability 2020 is a publication that discusses various aspects of sustainability and green management.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>GPPO<|>GSV aims to strengthen GPPO to enhance organizational goals related to sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>EGC<|>GSV is crucial for reducing EGC in organizations, promoting better environmental governance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>EEP<|>GSV positively affects EEP by enhancing employee engagement in environmental practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPPO<|>EGC<|>GPPO is negatively correlated with EGC, indicating that better employee engagement reduces environmental governance issues<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPPO<|>EEP<|>GPPO positively influences EEP, leading to improved employee performance in environmental initiatives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGC<|>EEP<|>EGC negatively affects EEP, suggesting that compliance issues hinder employee performance in sustainability<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSV<|>TAIWAN<|>The study on GSV and its implications for green management was conducted in Taiwan<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>GSV<|>Sustainability 2020 discusses the importance of GSV in promoting corporate sustainability<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
