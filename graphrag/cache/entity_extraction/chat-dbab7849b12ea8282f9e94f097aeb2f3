In the year prior to being targeted, only 21.7 percent of target firms have at least one female board member; by year +2 this percentage increases to 57.5 percent. Therefore, 35.8 percent of target firms increased their female board representation from zero to at least one female board member from year -1 to year +2, an increase that is significant at the p = 0.01 level.\n\nControl firms that had similar characteristics to targeted firms but were not targeted also show significant increases over the sample period, increasing from 35.8 percent to 52.5 percent. However, when comparing differences in differences, we find that the target firms’ increase of 35.8 percent is significantly higher than the control firms’ increase of 16.7 percent (p = 0.01).\n\n------------------------------- Insert Table 6 about here -------------------------------\n\nIn Panels B and C, we report the proportions of boards that have at least one female board member separately for financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists, respectively. In Panel B we observe that only 6.5 percent of firms targeted by financially-motivated activists had any female board representation in year -1, while 27.4 percent of non-\n\nTargeted firms had at least one female board member at this time, a highly significant difference at p = 0.01. While both targeted and non-targeted firms increase their female representation such that 50 percent of both samples have at least one female on their board of directors by year +2, a comparison of difference in differences shows that the increase in frequency is significantly greater for the targeted firms (p = 0.01). As shown in Panel C, 37.9 percent of firms targeted by socially-motivated activists have at least one female board member in year -1, versus 44.8 percent of non-targeted firms, a difference that is not statistically significant. The proportion of firms with any female board representation increases over the sample period for both groups; however, the increase for the targeted firms from 37.9 percent to 65.5 percent is significantly greater than the increase from 44.8 percent to 55.2 percent for the non-targeted firms (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that both financially- and socially-motivated activists are successful in achieving goals related to increasing gender diversity.\n\nIn Panels D through F, we report the mean percent of female board representation for targeted and non-targeted firms. Results are similar to those reported in Panels A through C. In Panel D we report changes for the full sample. As previously noted, both groups have markedly low female representation in year -1: 3.0 percent for sample firms and 4.4 percent for control firms. Again, both groups show significant improvements: target firms increase by 5.1 percent to 8.1 percent (p = 0.01) and non-target firms increase by 2.9 percent to 7.3 percent (p = 0.01), with the increase for target firms being significantly higher (p = 0.01). However, it is striking that female board representation remains relatively low at 8.1 percent for target firms in year +2.\n\nWe report changes in female representation for financially-motivated proposals in Panel E and for socially-motivated proposals in Panel F. Here the results confirm the earlier findings in Tables 4 and 5 – financially-motivated activists target firms with almost no female representation.\n\nboard representation and with significantly lower female board representation than non-target firms. Female board representation for target firms increases by 5.5 percent, from a mere 0.9 percent to 6.4 percent, compared to an increase of 3.5 percent for non-target firms. For socially-motivated firms, target and non-target firms are similar in year -1 (5.3 percent versus 5.7 percent), but once again target firms increase more significantly than non-target firms – by 4.7 percent to 10.0 percent compared to an increase of 2.3 percent to 8.0 percent for non-target firms. The differences in differences in Panels E and F are significant at the p = 0.10 and p = 0.05 levels, respectively.\n\nThese findings speak to the effectiveness of shareholder activism in this setting. While not one proposal that went to vote received a majority vote, many firms took action following the proposal, with almost 36 percent of firms increasing their female representation from zero to at least one for the period surrounding the proposal.\n\nIn addition to the univariate comparisons in Table 6, we perform a cross-sectional regression analysis of changes in female representation. Although we select the comparison group for the effectiveness analysis in Table 6 to include only those S&P 1500 firms that have the most similar propensity to be targeted as our sample firms, this additional cross-sectional analysis provides further assurance that other differences across the two groups are not driving our results. We define the dependent variable as the change in the percentage of female representation (Change in Female Representation) from year -1 to year +2 and regress is on the indicator variable Target and the set of independent variables used in the target antecedent analysis in Table 5.\n\nChange in Female Representationt+2 = α + αTargeti,t + βCONTROLt-1 + εi,t (2)\n\nAll variables are as defined earlier and are measured in the year prior to being targeted by activists.
