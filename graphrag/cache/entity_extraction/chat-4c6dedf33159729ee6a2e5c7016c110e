Over time, this can result in value co-destruction for the focal firm in the form of lost competitive advantages and increased spending on competitive warfare.\n\n# Operations\n\nThere is no doubt that the advent of GAI is already impacting HT operations in a meaningful way and will continue to do so in ways we cannot yet imagine as the technology continues to develop. Because GAI can perform expressive tasks and craft individualized interactions with guests, it is ideal for communication purposes (Brendlinger, 2023). GAI chatbots, for example, can analyze customer data to understand the context of each customer inquiry and use natural language processing (NLP) techniques (Athuraliya & Farook, 2018) to craft a personalized response, resulting in the creation of value for the customer, who receives an instant, personalized answer to the question or request.\n\nWhile such personalized recommendations and experiences create value for both the customer and the company, suggestions and experiences can also result in value co-destruction. Inherent in a personalized experience is the loss of the experimentation, exploration, and discovery that comes with trying new foods, traveling to offbeat places, and having experiences that force customers to stretch and grow outside of their comfort zone. Additionally, the information put forth by GAI can be incorrect, outdated, or biased, which can result in value co-destruction for both the firm and the customer in the form of bad experiences and guest complaints.\n\n# Marketing\n\nOne of the most impactful outcomes of GAI in the HT industry is expected to be hyper-personalization on the demand side (Guszkowski, 2023; Lalli, 2023; Mondal et al., 2023). GAI can help HT businesses create personalized marketing content at scale (and without extensive human involvement) to enhance booking experiences and marketing communication. As an example, hotels can use GAI to create personalized social media posts for their guests based on their preferences and past behavior. Such systems could analyze data such as the guest’s previous stays, dining preferences, and activities booked, and generate social media posts that exhibit relevant offers and experiences. Another example is the use of GAI to create personalized recommendations for customers. A GAI system can market personalized travel itineraries, accommodation options, and activities by analyzing data on a customer’s past purchases, search history, and preferences. This can help businesses create engaging and relevant advertising and social media content, increasing customer interest and engagement. As evidence, Haleem and colleagues (2022) note that marketers can enhance ROI by analyzing consumer data and understanding their genuine desires without wasting resources on unsuccessful advertising attempts.\n\nGAI can also be used to respond to comments on social media. Currently many companies only respond to a few selected comments simply because the human capital required to respond to every comment is cost-prohibitive. By using GAI to respond to customer or follower comments, the company will be able to increase consumer engagement on social media.\n\nGAI can be especially helpful in dealing with unfavorable online reviews. GAI can review the sentiments expressed in online reviews and respond in real-time. Additionally, these responses can be individualized, rather than using the one-size-fits-all responses that are so often seen in such circumstances. By creating personalized responses to negative online reviews, GAI can aid in service recovery, satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word of mouth.\n\nWhile these capabilities can certainly create value for both the company and the customer reading the reviews, there is a potential for value co-destruction as well. As online review sites become flooded with fake reviews that are generated by GAI, it may become impossible to trust any review at all. This may lead to the destruction of the familiar review and rating systems that exist currently, as they will no longer provide reliable information.\n\n# Destination Management\n\nGAI can be employed not only by individual companies, but also by destinations. At the travel decision level, GAI can add value to every stage of the trip from the anticipation and planning phase, to the trip to the site, the onsite experience, and the post-reflection phase of the trip. In the destination development stage, GAI can enable the development of more engaging, hyper-personalized tourism products, such as personalized travel guides based on individual preferences. For example, a\n\n# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)\n\nTravel guide could generate an itinerary for a day in Paris, focusing on museums per the traveler’s request. This travel guide can also adapt in real-time to factors such as the traveler’s mood or weather conditions, adjusting the itinerary to include more outdoor activities if the weather is nice. In addition to inspiring travelers and developing customized trip plans at the pre-trip stage, GAI can be integrated to the destination experience by offering navigation routes based on interests and preferences of visitors during the trip stage. Hence, GAI has the potential to replace guides and even local people to assist people during their travel. However, this loss of autonomy in travel-related decision making could also negatively affect the tourist experience resulting in value co-destruction (Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021).\n\n# Human Resources and Talent Management\n\nStaff training and development is a key area ripe for the infusion of GAI. Science-based GAI training can empower associates to develop exactly the skills they are lacking, as GAI will be able to identify areas in which the associate needs help, create an individualized training program, provide real-time feedback, and make shifts to the training program based on each person’s progress and success. Training and development are key factors in employee retention, and GAI can assist with this important initiative by developing highly relevant, hyper-personalized training and associate development.\n\nGAI also has the potential to supplement human labor in the HT industry by reducing the need for humans to do repetitive and time-consuming tasks.
