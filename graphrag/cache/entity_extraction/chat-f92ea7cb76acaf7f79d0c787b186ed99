The organizational understanding of this cycle (including its economic, environmental, and social impacts) inevitably conditions stakeholder perceptions regarding value propositions, value creation, and value capture and is essential for the adequate organizational orientation towards sustainability.\n\n# 3 | METHODOLOGY\n\nThis study was based on exploratory qualitative research methodology, which is adequate for the development of new explanations regarding how different factors relate with each other, enhancing new approaches and theories regarding a specific segment of reality (Creswell, 2003; Reiter, 2017).\n\nThe research study was planned and structured in two stages: literature review on different constructs related with CS management, through systematic and reproducible procedures (Littell, Corcoran, & Pillai, 2008) and the use of the grounded theory (GT) for the generation of new theoretical insights (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). These methodological processes are illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n# 3.1 | Literature review\n\nA structured literature review was performed in two different steps: (a) planning and (b) optimization (Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). It started with an exploratory search for articles on the Thomson Reuters, Web of Science and Elsevier Scopus databases, published between 2008 and 2019, focusing the topics TBL, sustainability integration, CS, intelligence, and value co-creation. A total of 570 papers were found, which were divided in different categories in order to enable the perception of the initial scope of the research field (Creswell, 2003). A refinement selection was then performed, excluding those articles that did not focus directly the research topic. A total of 120 papers remained at this stage, focusing the integration of organizational sustainability and organizational sustainability practices. These papers were then subject to content analysis (Berg, 2009) in order to provide data to feed the GT methodology.\n\n# 3.2 | Grounded theory\n\nGT is a methodology developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss regarding qualitative research, explicitly focused on the generation of new theoretical insights based on systematic strategic processes of information collection and analysis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). By the identification of causal connections in specific contexts, GT enhances non-linear integral approaches to understand the multifaceted dynamics of complex systems (Charmaz, 2006).\n\nGT was developed as a response to the gap existing between theoretical and qualitative empirical research, given the predominance of quantitative methodologies in social science studies (Gibbons et al., 1994; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Jupp, 2006). Through GT, it is possible to use exploratory research in the development of models aiming to study different social contexts, even if the researcher has little control over the studied phenomena. GT emphasizes strategic approaches in the development and construction of theory from data (Foley & Timonen, 2015; Jupp, 2006).\n\nIn qualitative data analysis, Glaser and Strauss (1967) refer that the phenomenon can be explained through an inductive approach, a deductive approach, or a combination of both. Deductive research is based on the absence of predetermined theories to guide information and data collection. Inductive research is associated with interpretative approaches, allowing the researcher to use subjective reasoning based on real experiences (Ridenour & Newman, 2008).\n\nTo Glaser and\n\nFIGURE 2 Mixed methods approach to propose the conceptual model\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\nStrauss (1967), research can generate either formal or substantive theories. Formal theory is developed in a broad scope research area, whereas substantive theory provides interpretation to a delimited problem in a particular area (Charmaz, 2006).\n\nThe present research study develops its research objectives through formal theory. GT will be used to explore how predictive management can enhance IS solutions leading to more sustainable business models. Based on contributions that enhance the dynamics and causal connections between sustainability and its integration in business plans, information gathered in the literature review will be used to develop an integrated, delimited, and universal theory regarding the research problem, giving analytic/inductive support to the research. GT methodology enhances the understanding of the meaning of data in several circumstances and therefore uses evidence to propose concepts by studying and examining information through successive levels of analysis (Charmaz, 2006). The concept this research aims to propose is a framework focusing organizational sustainability management, designated as ISI, described in the following sections.\n\n# 4 | INTEGRATIVE SUSTAINABLE INTELLIGENCE\n\nCorley and Gioia identified two requirements to achieve a theoretical contribution: originality, obtained by exercising a different point of view and usefulness, obtained by contributing to a broader understanding of the research subject (Corley & Gioia, 2011). The framework ISI proposes an alternative management model for CS, which complies with both requirements referred above: It provides new dynamics and understanding regarding organizational change through the adaptation of alternatives and considers different requirements and methodologies to foster the transition to a sustainability-oriented model. The usefulness of this framework is obtained through the development of a new concept that contributes in practice for the understanding and enhancement of organizational transition for sustainable management models.\n\nThe transition from economic models, focused on profit maximization, to models aiming the conciliation of economic, social, and environmental values, can be achieved either through small evolutive changes and/or radical change processes (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). Changes represent opportunities, which must be anticipated, prepared, and managed. Ignoring the need to implement the required changes implies not responding to new challenges and opportunities, with consequent losses at the economic, social, and environmental levels. ISI framework, described in the following sections, aims to contribute with a new insight regarding organizational change in the transition towards sustainability.\n\ncommitments, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
