ChatGPT by OpenAI, has revolutionized the business world, with benefits including improved accessibility, efficiency, and cost reduction. This article reviews recent developments of generative AI in business and finance, summarizes its practical applications, provides examples of the latest generative AI tools, and demonstrates that generative AI can revolutionize data analysis in industry and academia. To test the ability of generative AI to support decision-making in financial markets, we use the ChatGPT to capture corporate sentiments towards environmental policy by inputting text extracted from corporate financial statements. Our results demonstrate that the sentiment scores generated by ChatGPT can predict firms’ risk-management capabilities and stock return performance. This study also highlights the potential challenges and limitations associated with generative AI. Finally, we propose several questions for future research at the intersection of generative AI with business and finance.\n\n# ARTICLE HISTORY\n\nReceived 9 May 2023\n\nAccepted 1 August 2023\n\n# KEYWORDS\n\nGenerative AI; ChatGPT; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Practical Applications\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has brought about an unprecedented transformation in every aspect of society. In recent decades, its emergence has significantly influenced business and management (Korzynski et al. 2023; Singh et al., 2022), financial markets (Scepanovic et al. 2023; Wan et al. 2021), healthcare (Senior 2023), education (Yang 2023), productivity (Noy and Zhang 2023), and climate action (Debnath et al. 2022). Over the past few months, the latest AI technique, generative AI, has caused a massive stir in academia and industry worldwide. Despite its great importance and potential, generative AI has sparked ongoing debates in news media outlets such as Yahoo!Finance1 and Forbes2, regarding its ethical challenges to protecting data privacy, social justice and equality, and energy consumption. This has also led to calls for further efforts to improve its associated regulatory framework. In addition, several technical challenges limit the ability to maximize the benefits of generative AI for industry and academia.\n\nFuture research and practice need to focus on developing generative AI applications in a reasonable, logical, compliant, and beneficial manner, which requires mutual collaboration.\n\n# CONTACT\n\nRuoran Zhao ruoran.zhao@ed.ac.uk Business School, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK\n\n© 2023 The Chinese Economic Association – UK\n---\n# 2\n\nB.

This study outlines the prospects of generative AI in business and finance, compares practical examples of the capabilities of three widely used generative AI tools (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard), presents a case study of a generative AI application, and discusses the ethical issues and limitations of generative AI tools. Despite the current controversy surrounding generative AI, our empirical analysis acknowledges its positive aspects for market participants and researchers based on the finding that it can effectively inform firms’ risk management capabilities.\n\nAlthough generative AI was introduced in 1966, when Joseph Weizenbaum proposed the generative AI program ELIZA at MIT, the development of generative AI technologies did not take off until 2020, when OpenAI introduced Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3 (GPT-\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
