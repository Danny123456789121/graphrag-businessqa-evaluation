Hence we employ data for the remaining 65 Örms. In the robustness section, we show that using the full cross-section of 80 Örms does not a§ect our main Öndings. Monthly stock returns are calculated as rj;t+1 = ln(Pj;t+1) - ln(Pj;t), where Pj;t is the total return index (that accounts for dividend reinvestment) of stock j at time t obtained from Datastream. The market value of equity (ME) is also taken from Datastream.\n\nThe return to the market portfolio is proxied by the DAX stock index return taken from Datastream. Our proxy for the monthly risk-free rate is the one-month money market rate reported by Deutsche Bundesbank. The Fama-French (1993) size and value factors and the Carhart (1997) momentum factor are provided by the Centre for Financial Research at the University of Cologne. These factors are especially constructed for the German economy (see, Artmann, Finter, Kempf, Koch and Theissen, 2012). Note that these factors are available until December 2012, which covers our full sample. This set of Fama-French factors for Germany has recently been studied in detail by Bruckner, Lehmann, Schmidt and Stehle (2014), who assess the factor construction and the underlying data and conclude that these factors are highly reliable. This is especially true for our sample period that begins in 2003.\n\n# 5.3 Carbon Emission Allowances\n\nWe manually collect information on the number of carbon emission allowances given for free to each Örm using the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which is a source of veriÖed carbon emission information set up by the European Commission. Note that the CITL emission allowances are allocated by the member stateís National Allocation Plan for each individual installation of each Örm. We match each installation to the Örms it belongs to and aggregate across installations for each Örm to determine the total number of free EUAs issued to each Örm. Overall, the companies included in our analysis received about one third of the total amount of EUAs allocated in Germany. This is because a considerable proportion of the allowances were granted to utilities that are partly state-owned (hence are not public) or trade infrequently outside of the main stock indexes.\n\n10\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 5.4 Descriptive Statistics\n\nTable 2 reports monthly descriptive statistics for the 65 German stocks over the two sample periods of November 2003 to March 2009 and November 2003 to December 2012. The table indicates that Örms belong to a wide range of industries effectively capturing every aspect of the German economy. Of the 65 Örms, 24 received carbon emission allowances (the “dirty” Örms), whereas 41 Örms did not (the “clean” Örms). The number of annual allowances issued to each Örm ranges from 5,000 to 109 million. 14 Örms received more than 100,000 annual allowances and eight Örms received more than one million annual allowances. In general, the number of Phase I allowances tends to be higher than that of Phase II, especially for large polluters.\n\nThe table also reports Örm size measured by the average market value of equity (ME) as well as the annualized mean return, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio for each Örm. Overall, the sample of 65 Örms represents a high proportion of the German stock market capitalization, while capturing a wide distribution of Örms across industries, size, performance and use of carbon emission allowances.\n\n# 6 The Carbon Premium in Stock Returns\n\nOur empirical analysis provides a framework for investigating whether Örms that received carbon emission allowances significantly outperformed Örms that did not. In particular, we are interested in whether on average “dirty” Örms exhibit abnormal excess returns relative to “clean” Örms. In other words, our main question is whether there is a carbon premium in stock returns.\n\n# 6.1 A Portfolio Approach\n\nWe address this question by designing three carbon portfolios: the “dirty”, “medium” and “clean” portfolios. The dirty portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which during the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received annually more than one million free EUAs. The medium portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which for the same period have received annually more than zero but less than one million free EUAs. The clean portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which have not received any EUAs. Throughout our analysis we also form the “dirty-minus-clean” portfolio, which is equivalent to going long on the dirty portfolio and short.\n\non the clean portfolio. This difference portfolio allows us to better understand the role of carbon allowances in determining financial performance. All portfolios are formed with equal weights.6 Note that the composition of the three carbon portfolios does not change over time since it is the same firms that each year satisfy the criteria for inclusion in the portfolios. Therefore, there is no portfolio rebalancing.\n\nThe first criterion for distinguishing between dirty versus clean firms on the basis of whether they have received free carbon allowances is natural. In the context of our data sample, 24 stocks received carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty and medium portfolios), whereas 41 did not (belonging to the clean portfolio). The second criterion for distinguishing between firms receiving a high number of carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty portfolio) and those receiving a low number of carbon allowances (belonging to the medium portfolio) is however ad hoc. Throughout our analysis, we draw the line between the dirty\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
