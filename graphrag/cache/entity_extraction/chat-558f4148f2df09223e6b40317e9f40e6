We used total assets (TA), net profit after tax (NPAT), return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE) as key financial accounting indicators. In line with [19], TA was used to measure the size of the banks. The other indicators have been used by similar studies that address the link between sustainability performance and financial performance in the banking sector (see, for instance, [7,8,38,77]).\n\nThe analysis of the sustainability performance was conducted in line with earlier studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of banks [8]. It is based on the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative [74]. The analysis assessed the presence of strategies, activities, products, and services in the categories of social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The latter were assessed because they are addressed by the ERM. If an indicator was mentioned, a bank achieved a value 1 for the indicator. Otherwise, it achieved the value 0.\n\nTo analyze Granger causality [21], we used panel regression models with one-year lags for sustainability performance and financial performance, respectively. As the Hausman test [78] was significant, we used fixed-effects models. To control for accuracy of the regression, we used bootstrapping [79].\n\n# 5. Results\n\nWe start by presenting the major financial and sustainability indicators of the banks in the sample, split by banking types (see Table 2). In line with Bangladesh Bank, we distinguished between conventional commercial banks, foreign commercial banks, Islamic banks, specialized banks, and state-owned commercial banks.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999\n\n# Table 2.
