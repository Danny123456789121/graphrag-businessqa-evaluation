Our study presents a review of academic research on this topic by applying a second-order meta-analysis. The data sample combines 25 previous meta-analyses yielding a sample size of one million observations. Our results demonstrate a highly significant, positive, robust, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation. The relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key CSP determinant. We find a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation for operational CFP. Furthermore, we add a new perspective on potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: social issues-oriented journals and methodological weaker papers do not distort the positive CSP-CFP relation. Our conclusion is: Based on the extant literature, the business case for being a good firm is undeniable. © 2018 The Authors.

For nearly 50 years, scholars have investigated this question. The search for the answer has become particularly prominent since the end of the 1990s. Our study sample comprises 1214 empirical primary studies on the CSP-CFP relation. While considerable research has been conducted, it is as yet less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and in which way various moderating factors determine the CSP-CFP relation (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Peloza, 2009). Moreover, the robustness of the business case over time has only occasionally been analyzed (Borgers, Derwall, Koedijk, & ter Horst, 2013; Derwall, Koedijk, & Ter Horst, 2011). The aim of this study is to provide a more detailed understanding of the CSP-CFP relation.\n\n*Correspondence to: Timo Busch, University of Hamburg, School of Business, Economics and Social Science, Hamburg, Germany.

Busch and G. Friede\n\nIn 2003, the widely cited Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) meta-study responded to calls for a moratorium on CSP-CFP research (Margolis & Walsh, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Orlitzky et al. (2003) found a significant, positive, and bidirectional correlation of CSP with CFP. Despite these findings, the authors claim that this relation cannot be generalized across all CSP dimensions and CFP categories, detecting a large variability – even after correcting for sampling error and measurement error. Since then, the picture has become even more ambiguous and critical debates have resurfaced about the actual CSP-CFP relation (Aldag, 2013; Barnett, 2007; Borgers et al., 2013; Devinney, 2009; Fleming & Jones, 2013; Orlitzky, 2011, 2013; Wood, 2010). On the one hand, many scholars claim that, to date, the literature on the CSP-CFP relation remains inconclusive. On the other hand, a whole range of new studies and further meta-analyses have been published supporting a positive relation. Thus, more than a decade after Orlitzky et al. (2003), it seems to be the right time to revive the paper’s spirit and ask: when generalizing existing research, is there still evidence that it pays off to be a good firm?\n\nTo answer this question, we apply a second-order meta-analysis. In other scientific disciplines like medicine, psychology, or education (i.e. research areas typically also experiencing vast amounts of data and conflicting results), meta-analytic techniques are widespread and have been applied since the 1960s (Glass, 1976; Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter, Schmidt, & Jackson, 1982). With the growing number of meta-analyses, the idea of cumulative meta-analysis also appeared (Kazrin, Durac, & Agteros, 1979). Several labels have been used for such analyses: overview of reviews, review of reviews, umbrella reviews, meta-reviews, cumulative meta-analyses, meta-meta-analysis, and second-order meta-analysis (Cooper & Koenka, 2012). However, until recently, no standard procedure with comparable rigor to first-order meta-analytical approaches had emerged. This paper makes use of the novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis proposed by Schmidt and Oh (2013).\n\nWe contribute to the academic\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Hamburg is a research university located in Hamburg, Germany, known for its School of Business, Economics and Social Science.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deutsche Asset Management Investment is a financial services company based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, involved in asset management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>PERSON<|>Timo Busch is a researcher affiliated with the University of Hamburg, focusing on corporate social and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>PERSON<|>Gunnar Friede is a researcher associated with the University of Hamburg and Deutsche Asset Management Investment, contributing to studies on corporate performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>A journal that publishes research on corporate social responsibility and environmental management, including studies on the CSP-CFP relation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG<|>Timo Busch is affiliated with the University of Hamburg, where he conducts research on corporate social performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG<|>Gunnar Friede is affiliated with the University of Hamburg, contributing to research in the field of corporate performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT<|>Gunnar Friede is associated with Deutsche Asset Management Investment, where he also conducts research on corporate performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT<|>Timo Busch collaborates with Gunnar Friede at Deutsche Asset Management Investment on studies related to corporate performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>Timo Busch has published research in the journal Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>Gunnar Friede has published research in the journal Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
