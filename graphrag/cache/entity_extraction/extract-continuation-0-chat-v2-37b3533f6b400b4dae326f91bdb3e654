Our results confirm recent findings (Krueger 2015) highlighting the relevance of content analysis of extra-financial news.\n\n# Out of Sight, Out of Mind?\n\nCultural distance affects the impact of ESG news (hypothesis #11). Previous papers have shown that within a country, investors overweight domestic firms20. Heath and Tversky (1991) explain this phenomenon by an aversion to ambiguity where investors infer beliefs from preferences. In line with the literature on the domestic bias, our results suggest that when events take place in countries sharing the same official language with the involved company headquarters, they have more financial impact. Interestingly, the effect of cultural distance is lower when considering the ½ 5; þ5 event window compared to the ½ 1; þ1 event window. This may suggest another interpretation: events occurring in countries sharing less proximity with headquarters have a similar impact, but shareholders take more time to assimilate this information and incorporate it into prices. Note that we did not find such results for the geographical distance.21\n\n# Conclusion\n\nInvestors and analysts have access to more information than ever on firms’ behavior toward environmental, social and corporate governance issues. And whether they like it or not, corporate executives have to take into account CSR concerns, if only to improve financial performance and lower risks. This paper examines the stock markets reaction to ESG news gathered in the Covalence EthicalQuote database which includes, after several filters, more than 30,000 occurrences concerning 100 listed companies over the period 2002–2010. It means that we do not only consider extreme events, but also very ordinary events. Our results first point out that shareholders react to the publication of ESG news.\n\n21In a previous version, we tested whether the impact of ESG news depends on the country where the event took place; in particular, we distinguished developed and developing countries. On the one hand, the impact should be higher for negative events if they occur in developed countries compared to developing ones, because of environmental liability rules or the stringency of regulation. On the other hand, due to the difference of media coverage, small events are more likely to be reported in developed countries. We did not observe any significant differences.\n\n# G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit\n\nESG news, but mainly (not to say only) to negative ESG news. While the change in firm’s market value on a window of 3 days around the publication of negative ESG news is about 0.1% on average, the impact of positive ESG news is barely significant. This loss due to negative ESG events is mitigated when the targeted firms have previously disclosed more positive ESG information than their peers and when the sector has a good ESG reputation. In contrast, the loss is amplified when the news has a quantitative and economic orientation, and when there is a feeling of emotional closeness between the event and the firm.\n\nMany directions could be explored to improve this study. The most visible extension could be to implement more sophisticated approaches for the computation and the analysis of abnormal returns. But more fundamentally, there is a lack of information to proxy the extent of the event. As the previous papers on CSR events, we consider all news equally. Indeed, we have no way to distinguish a priori the most striking events. As such, the media audience could be interesting to investigate, considering that the more media coverage, the heavier the financial losses due to negative ESG events. Moreover, if the Covalence EthicalQuote database provides remarkable research possibilities on CSR, it could be improved with systematic and automatic requests. This would allow notably to deepen the lexical analysis with other categories. Finally, it could be interesting to refine the analysis of reputation and greenwashing.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Mireille Chiroleu-Assouline, Patricia Crifo, Yannick Le Pen, Bert Sholtens, Charles Cho, Fabrizio Coricelli, Marie-Aude Laguna, Thomas Lyon, participants at the Informing Green Markets conference (Ann Arbor, 2011), the Mines-ParisTech workshop on the Economics of Corporate Social Responsibility (Paris, 2011), the UNPRI Mistra conference (Sigtuna, 2011), and the ESG seminar of the Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, 2011), as well as two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.
