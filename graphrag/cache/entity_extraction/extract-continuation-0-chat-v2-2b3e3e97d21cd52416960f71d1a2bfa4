Whereas CI indicates the confidence interval and CrI the credibility interval.\n\nReduced to 74.9% (95% CrI, attenuated results). However, the share of negative results remains at 0%, as the lowest effect in the 25 meta-analyses is –0.003. A quarter (25.1%) of the sample effect sizes is within the CrI and is correspondingly classified as neutral results.\n\nTo eliminate potential positive biases in these meta-analytical summary effects, we also drill down to the primary study level and the sample of 551 studies. The share of studies with significant positive correlations is reduced to a minimum of 62.6% (95% CrI, attenuated results) with a maximum percentage of negatives as high 14.5% (95% CI, disattenuated results). An attenuated correlation level (interval) above 0.141 would be needed to bring down the percentage of positive correlations to the level in the vote-count studies of 47.9%. This cut-off is close to the population unweighted average correlation of 0.159.\n\n# Summary effects: correlations\n\n# Vote-count studies\n\nNext, an approximation of the correlation effect size in vote-count studies based on the vote-count method of Hedges and Olkin (1985, 47ff) is conducted. The weighted average correlation rv= in all vote-count studies is calculated at 0.146. The corresponding p-value of <.001 indicates a correlation factor highly significant and different from zero. The additional check for statistical power (Cohen 1988; Faul et al. 2007) reveals that for the determined rv= and the corresponding number of n, the chance of a Type II error is close to zero.\n\n# Meta-analyses\n\nFor reasons of comparability with the vote-count effect size estimate rv=, we compute the attenuated sample-size weighted average correlation for the 25 meta-analyses. The calculated correlation rm= is 0.118. The p-value of similarity of rm= and r= is notably high at 0.638. This means vote-count studies and meta-analyses determine statistically comparable results for the ESG–CFP relation. However, generalizing this finding for both methods universally may not be appropriate due to the almost independent samples containing few overlaps and very different variance levels.\n\nNext, we calculate the first-order meta-analytical averages as both uncorrected and corrected parameters for the transparent sub-sample of 551 primary studies. The correlation ri is determined at 0.119 and pi at 0.169. The meta-analytical second-order effect size for the 25 meta-analyses.\n\ncombining 1902 gross studies reveals a correlation of ri = 0.108 and for the corrected effect size pi = 0.150. Worth mentioning is that the value for the vote-count effect size rv = 0.351 is statistically not different from the first- and second-order meta-analytical results (minimum p difference to ri). Even though the vote-count technique is a rough estimate based on simplified assumptions, it nonetheless yields surprisingly comparable estimations of the ESG–CFP relation compared to the sample of meta-analyses aggregated with the method for second-order meta-analysis – at least for our setup.\n\nThe p-values for all of our meta-analytical means are below .01 and indicate a statistical highly significant positive deviation from zero. In a similar manner, the 95% CrI of 0.058–0.242 for pi is another indicator of the positive nature of the ESG–CFP relation. Moreover, the control for statistical power of these values reveals very robust results, with a Cohen’s power for all figures above 0.8 and in four cases close to 1.\n\n# Portfolio studies and nonportfolio studies\n\nAll previous vote-count and meta-analysis effects contain a blend of nonportfolio and portfolio studies. Making this differentiation is important as aggregated firm performance in virtual portfolios and financial products such as mutual funds or indices may deviate from primary firm data. Several primary portfolio studies and corresponding reviews report an abnormally low level of positive findings.
