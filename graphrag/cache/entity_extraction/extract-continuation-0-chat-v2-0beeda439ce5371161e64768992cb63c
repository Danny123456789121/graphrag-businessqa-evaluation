Besides the explanatory (moderator) variables and their descriptive statistics (columns 1 to 3), this table presents the results from Bayesian model averaging (columns 4 to 6) and metaregression analysis via WLS (columns 7 to 9). In the WLS regression, we only include explanatory variables with PIP > 0.2. Standard errors are clustered at the study level.

The same also holds for small firms compared with large companies (small firms). In order to cover potential differences in the effects due to estimation differences, OLS estimation distinguishes simple OLS techniques (=1) from more sophisticated approaches (=0). Finally, the dummy variable endogeneity considered indicates if the used estimation procedure considers potential endogeneity between CEP and CFP.\n\nFor the selection of the moderating variables, we face the problem that there is no underlying theory to derive the best set of variables. Thus, we collect a broad set of variables. If we would include all explanatory variables in the same regression model, we would probably face two problems: multicollinearity and high model uncertainty. To address these issues, we follow recent developments in meta‐regression research and employ Bayesian model averaging (BMA; see, e.g., Babecky & Havranek, 2014; Zigraiova & Havranek, 2016). Instead of selecting just one of the possible regression specifications, the general idea behind BMA is to run regressions with different subsets of possible combinations of explanatory variables. Thus, BMA can be thought of a robustness check with many subsets of explanatory variables. As a full enumeration of all possible subsets of explanatory variables would require too much computing capacity, a Monte Carlo chain algorithm is applied to consider the most promising models. The distribution of the model parameters over the individual models is captured by the posterior means and standard deviations. Furthermore, we can compute the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) for each explanatory variable, which is the sum of the posterior probabilities across all regression specifications including this variable. The PIP denotes the probability that a variable is included in the “true” regression model. Table 5 reports the numerical results for the BMA in the central three columns. The posterior mean, standard deviation, and the PIP are shown in the first three columns.\n\nIn the next step, we add all moderator variables with a PIP greater than 0.2 into the multiple WLS model following Equation (6), as these variables are identified to have explanatory power for heterogeneity. The results from the WLS regression are presented in the right three columns of Table 5.\n\nThe BMA results show that mean sample year—1950 crucially affects the CEP–CFP relation with the highest PIP of 1.00 (posterior mean = −0.006). Moreover, the analysis reveals a strong impact for reactive CEP (PIP = 0.91, posterior mean = −0.082). All other moderator variables do not even reach a weak level. In the subsequent\n\nThereby, we follow the classification by Eicher, Papageorgiou, and Raftery (2011) and categorize an effect as “weak” if the PIP is between 0.5 and 0.75, “substantial” if the PIP is between 0.75 and 0.95, “strong” for values between 0.95 and 0.99, and “crucial” for values above 0.99.\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\n# 11\n\n# TABLE 6 Results of subgroup analysis\n\n|Subsample| |n|k|Random effects mean effect size|Standard error|Q statistic (df)|I2 (%)|τ|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Full sample| |142|893|0.072***|0.006|5217.99***(892)|85.68|0.144|\n|CEP strategy| | | | | | | | |\n|Reactive|j = 0|20|39|0.039*|0.021|115.57***(38)|66.24|0.089|\n| |j ≠ 0|6|22|0.021|0.014|42.23***(21)|37.40|0.039|\n|Non‐reactive|j = 0|103|530|0.080***|0.007|2527.71***(529)|82.70|0.142|\n| |j ≠ 0|52|302|0.069***|0.010|2333.61***(301)|89.86|0.155|\n|Time| | | | | | | | |\n|Mean sample year ≤ 2000|j = 0|51|203|0.098***|0.013|974.81***(202)|82.56|0.154|\n| |j ≠ 0|31|157|0.103***|0.012|1001.39***(156)|82.97|0.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OLS ESTIMATION<|>EVENT<|>OLS estimation is a statistical method used to estimate the relationships between variables in a regression analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING<|>EVENT<|>Bayesian model averaging is a statistical technique that accounts for model uncertainty by averaging over multiple models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Corporate environmental performance refers to a company's efforts and outcomes in managing its environmental impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Corporate financial performance measures a company's financial health and profitability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUJII, IWATA, KANEKO, AND MANAGI<|>PERSON<|>Fujii, Iwata, Kaneko, and Managi are researchers who contributed to the study of estimation differences in corporate performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EICHER, PAPAGEORGIOU, AND RAFTERY<|>PERSON<|>Eicher, Papageorgiou, and Raftery are researchers who classified the effects of variables in regression analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OLS ESTIMATION<|>BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING<|>OLS estimation is used in conjunction with Bayesian model averaging to address model uncertainty in regression analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Corporate environmental performance is analyzed in relation to corporate financial performance to understand their relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUJII, IWATA, KANEKO, AND MANAGI<|>BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING<|>Fujii, Iwata, Kaneko, and Managi's research supports the use of Bayesian model averaging in addressing estimation differences<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EICHER, PAPAGEORGIOU, AND RAFTERY<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE<|>Eicher, Papageorgiou, and Raftery's classification helps in understanding the effects of corporate environmental performance<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
