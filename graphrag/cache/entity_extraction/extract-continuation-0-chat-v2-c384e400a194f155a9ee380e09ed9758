Linguistic variables based on fuzzy membership function [95].\n\n# Step III. Constructing a fuzzy-based matrix for comparison purposes\n\nExperts used the TFNs to elaborate pairwise comparisons of corporate sustainability main and sub-attributes. The fuzzy comparison matrix X was drawn from the expert’s opinions by using the arithmetic mean function for pairwise comparison, as presented in Equation (1).\n\n|∼|…|b1n|\n|---|---|---|\n|∼|…|b12|\n|∼|…|…|\n|X =|…|…|\n\nwhere b∼ij = 1, if i = j, and b∼ij = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1, if i ≠ j. To calculate the scores for a pair, a reverse comparison was applied in the matrix for giving a reciprocal score.\n\n# Step IV. Developing the crisp comparison matrix Xij\n\nTo make the expert and decision-makers judgments more confident, the α-cut method can be used through the ranking of fuzzy numbers, in which it provides an interval of values based on fuzzy numbers. Figure 5 presented the α-cut method on TFN for this instance, if α = 0.5 will yield a0.5 = (2, 3, 4).\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 8747
