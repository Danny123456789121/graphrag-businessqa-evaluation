The age of generative Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing business operations in organizations by augmenting and automating processes. This necessitates a rethinking of Business Process Management (BPM) as businesses strive to understand the behaviour of their information systems, and services. The proliferation of tools for analyzing process executions, system interactions, and system dependencies is evidence of this priority in medium and large enterprises [1], [2]. With the advent of generative AI, businesses can use AI augmentation to enhance their processes flows and make decisions based on context and user input.\n\nThe model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process generation using generative AI is changing many processes, improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows.\n\n# Index Terms\n\nBusiness Process Management, Generative AI, Generative Pre-trained Transformer, Knowledge-Intensive Processes, Data-Centric Processes\n\n1 https://github.com/features/copilot\n\n979-8-3503-0485-5/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE\n\nDOI 10.1109/ICWS60048.2023.00099\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek.

Generative Pre-trained Transformer\n\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art language model that utilizes deep neural networks to generate human-like text. The model was first introduced by OpenAI2 in 2018 and has since been updated with larger and more complex versions. GPT’s success in generating coherent and high-quality text has led to the development of other generative models that employ similar techniques. Examples include:\n\n- Text Generation: ChatGPT3 developed by OpenAI;\n- Image Generation: DALL-E4 developed by OpenAI;\n- Speech Generation: VALL-E5 developed by Microsoft;\n- Code Generation: GitHub Copilot6 developed by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
