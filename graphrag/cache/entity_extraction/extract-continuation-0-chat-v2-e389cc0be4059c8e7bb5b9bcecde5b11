Proposed measures/practices\n\nExtending products' life span (C1) was stated as a highly effective strategy for reducing the use of economic resource loop (Bocken et al., 2016). Meanwhile, through utilizing optimal capability (C2), firms can achieve greater efficient performance in generating and managing economic resource (Lin and Tseng, 2016). Additionally, applying quality management mechanism (C3) is essential to allow the industrial sector to meet satisfaction, and enable the generation of profit (Lim et al., 2017). With respect to the logistics, optimizing horizontal logistics (C4) is increasingly considered to be a viable approach to lower cost and increase service levels, which significantly promotes the profit margin for firm (Defryn et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2019b).\n\nAs for management strategies for environmental resource, adopting eco-design approach (C5) aims at minimizing environmental life cycle impacts, and thereby maximizing firms' limited environmental resource (Eksi and Karaosmanoglu, 2018). Besides, developing cleaner technology (C6) helps organizations to more effectively access natural resource, and produce products and services with less negative impacts (Büyüközkan and Çifçi, 2013). Considering that the sustainability reports can disclose the utilization of environmental resource, thus improving the transparency of sustainability reports (C7) plays a crucial role in increasing the environmental agility of firms (Roca and Searcy, 2012). Moreover, enhancing decision making resilience (C8) enables the dynamic decision while encountering the environmental pressure from internal and external stakeholders (Galpin et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2019).\n\nSocial resource always includes the issue of engagement and relationship which involves diverse and various stakeholders (Wu et al., 2019b; Singh et al., 2019). Therefore, organizing synergetic involvement (C9) can be applied to obtain social resource through aligning\n\n# L. Xia, et al.\n\n# Environmental Impact Assessment Review 85 (2020) 106459\n\nstakeholders” engagement with a firm's tactics Wu et al., 2019b). Also, increasing employees' and customers' awareness (C10) will be of benefit to enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization through acquiring positive social resources (Shi et al., 2017). Moreover, raising institution's support and policy measures (C11) is capable of establishing social collaboration and participation among key stakeholders' in society such as producers, consumers and government (Singh et al., 2019). Finally, advocating corporate culture (C12) is involved in the sustainable resource beliefs of a firm, which are embedding in arranging the social resource (Bonn and Fisher, 2011; Tseng et al., 2019b).\n\nIndustrial sector needs to take social and economic concepts into account simultaneously in order to address the SRM issue with regard to current product policies, market dynamics and competitive advantages (Singh et al., 2019). Thus, improving stakeholder interactions (C13) should be adopted as a core practice to achieve resource management goals, which is a manifestation of power embedded in the relationship between stakeholders' and the SRM target (Frooman, 1999; Lin et al., 2019). After the stakeholders' employ firms' resource to create value, it is beneficial for building value proposition (C14), which includes social value proposition and economic value proposition (Kristensen and Renmmen, 2019). Additionally, building eco-friendly rewarding systems for employees (C15) should be applied to integrate firms' economic development goal with performance evaluation system (Lozano, 2015).\n\nOn the macro level, there is a conflict between the quality and quantity of economic activities, the former is too inefficient, while the latter is stated to be too extensive, which leads to large-scale environmental problems (Daly, 1992; IPCC, 2014). To address this issue, eco-efficiency is proposed as a win-win strategy for firms to target a less harmful use of natural resources, and reduces cost for the company (Heikkurinen et al., 2019). Accordingly, encouraging environmental innovation (C16) can deliver a win-win situation for the economic and environment resource (Liao et al., 2018). Then, pushing the sustainability agenda into government policy (C17) has been argued that mostly in the sphere of eco-efficiency, which is an effective means to address sustainability issue and the financial bottom line of firm (DeSimone and Popoff, 1999; Dauvergne and Lister, 2012; Heikkurinen et al., 2019). In addition, redesigning consumers' offer (C18) enables reduction of the environmental load of the use phase (Baines et al., 2007; Heikkurinen et al., 2019).\n\nSocio-environmental practices reflect various facets for solving internal and external sustainability issues, and reconcile company orientation with stakeholders’ needs (Spiller, 2000; Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006). Thus, pursuing eco-resource efficiency orientation (C19) can be expressed that maximize output while minimizing resources utilization without degrading social and environmental aspects (Horton et al., 2016; Von Geibler et al., 2016). Moreover, a potential effective way of managing a company's environmental policy is by socially linking it with purchasing function activities (Humphreys et al., 2004), for instance, selecting and collaborating with green supplier (C20) focuses on the buyer-supplier relationship where close relationship is necessary and capabilities are required (Sarkis and Talluri, 2002\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SRM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SRM refers to Sustainable Resource Management, a systematic approach to managing resources sustainably in organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CS refers to Circular Supply Chain, which emphasizes the reuse and recycling of resources in supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L.
