We obtained daily stock prices from the CRSP. The sample contains stocks in the mining and utilities industries, whose headquarters are in California. The stocks are divided into three groups based on the sentiment scores generated by ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT 3.5: high sentiment, low sentiment, and not mentioned.\n\nFirms with a higher negative sentiment score in the relevant text significantly improved their inputs and further reduced their leverage ratio (see Table 1). This result suggests that firms may reduce emissions by increasing R&D investment in cleaner technology and production equipment and reducing leverage to reduce the risk of financial distress in the face of stricter environmental regulations. This result is consistent with Nguyen and Phan’s (2020) findings that increased carbon risk leads to higher financial distress risk, which motivates firms to reduce their financial leverage. In terms of the difference between the estimates of Sentiment 4 and Sentiment 3.5, we find that the statistical significance of the two estimates is similar, and the estimate of Sentiment 4 on the leverage ratio of companies has a lower p-value than that of Sentiment 3.5. It suggests that the sentiment captured by ChatGPT 4 is a better predictor of firms’ leverage. This finding is consistent with our conclusion in Section 3 that ChatGPT 4 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 in language understanding and information interpretation.\n\nIn Table 2, the results show that firms with higher negative sentiment scores have lower values in daily firm returns, with a mean of 0.06 (based on the scores from ChatGPT4), compared to firms with lower negative sentiment scores (mean of 0.14). By contrast, the non-mentioned firms have the lowest values (mean of −0.12) and higher fluctuations (standard deviation of 2.04), consistent with the above findings regarding reducing firms’ leverage ratios. This result suggests that unlike firms with high sentiment scores, which have perceived unfavorable consequences of the stringent policy, the non-mentioned firms had not taken countermeasures, such as developing green technology (Fischer and Newell 2008; Hamamoto 2006; Johnstone, Haščič, and Popp 2010). Investments in these non-mentioned firms are likely to exhibit lower and more volatile returns.\n\nIn this section, we demonstrated the ability of ChatGPT to perform sentiment analysis in the financial market. After introducing an environmental policy, the negative sentiment of companies captured by ChatGPT predicted better risk management capabilities and less volatile stock performance. The negative sentiment generated by ChatGPT can effectively indicate risk factors, allowing investors to manage their portfolios strategically.\n\n# 5. Ethical concerns, limitations and regulation\n\nDespite the increasing use and great potential of generative AI, certain concerns, limitations, and challenges in its application require more attention.\n---\n# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES\n\n# 5.1 Ethical concerns\n\nData protection is one of the significant challenges associated with generative AI. Generative AI users may provide private information when using personalized services, making them vulnerable to data breaches. For example, when banks use generative AI to analyze customer information, they may need to handle many sensitive personal information, potentially threatening customer privacy if mishandled. This could, in turn, affect the bank’s reputation and customer satisfaction. Second, due to a lack of legislation, it is difficult to attribute responsibility for errors or violations caused by generative AI. For example, if the decisions or services of a firm supported by generative AI violate the law, who should be held legally responsible? Unlike humans, chatbots do not have a legal personality (Beerbaum 2023) under the current legal and regulatory framework. Third, generative AI tools threaten labour markets (Eisfeldt, Schubert, and Zhang 2023), especially in developing counties (Zhou et al. 2020). It is foreseeable that many simple and repetitive tasks will soon be performed using AI rather than humans. In particular, chatbot apps and other AI tools will likely replace many female-dominated occupations, such as customer service roles. However, this societal transformation will increase the demand for highly skilled workers to deploy and develop AI technologies (Ali 2023). The resulting unemployment, widening income inequality, and gender gaps may exacerbate social instability. Developing countries, which are more likely to suffer from the consequent inequalities, should consider the trade-offs between the opportunities and risks posed by emerging AI technologies and use their institutional characteristics to pursue not only industrial catch-up but also the social benefits of emerging technologies (Gherhes et al. 2023). Another issue is the increased energy consumption caused by training large datasets for ChatGPT (An, Ding, and Lin 2023), which can accelerate environmental degradation and the inefficient use of resources. Therefore, research into renewable and sustainable energy-efficient training methods is required.\n\n# 5.2 Limitations\n\nWe caution that some limitations of the use of generative AI in academia and industry should be considered. For example, generative AI can produce unusual and illogical responses such as fictitious references (Thorp 2023) and unintentionally biased output for users (ChatGpt and Demir 2023). In the financial sector, false data generated by generative AI can lead to problematic\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
