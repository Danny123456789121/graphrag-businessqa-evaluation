In order to determine whether self-reported measures of environmental performance lead to a different relationship between CEP and CFP, we analyze a subgroup of methodological issues that includes self-report versus archival measures of environmental performance. Contrary to expectations, there is no significant difference in the outcomes when using self-reported measures as opposed to archival data (Q = 1.18, p = 0.28). Studies using self-reported measures of environmental performance do not seem to have a stronger association with firm financial performance (r = 0.06, r = 0.08).\n\n# Supplemental Analyses\n\nIn addition to the meta-analysis, two supplemental analyses were performed to increase the robustness of the results. First, publication bias, also known as the file-drawer problem, is a potential threat with meta-analyses such that the published studies included in the sample may not be representative of all existing studies, including those unpublished. Following the method proposed by Orwin (1983), we found that the number of additional samples with a correlation of 0 that would be necessary to bring the effect size in this study of 0.062 down to 0.05 would be 17. To bring the effect size down to 0.04, would require an additional 39 additional samples, while doubling the number of samples with effect sizes of 0 would bring it down to about 0.03. Given the large number of additional samples necessary to substantially change the overall effect size we found in this study, we feel the results of our study are further strengthened.\n\nA subsequent modified weighted regression analysis that provides for a simultaneous test of the proposed moderators was also performed. The analysis was conducted using an algorithm Lipsey and Wilson (2001) developed to correct for standard errors, which is run within SPSS. The results of the regression generally corroborate the findings of the meta-analysis, further suggesting robust results. Interestingly, the results do indicate that the international moderator is as important as in the bivariate analysis, whereas the emissions moderator attains significance.\n\n# Discussion\n\nAs expected, our meta-analytic results of multiple studies of the general corporate environmental performance and financial performance link suggest a significant positive relationship, consistent with prior research (Orlitzky et al. 2003). In answering the question, “When does it pay (or not pay) to be green?” our results further suggest that important contingencies moderate the CEP–CFP relationship while others may not be as important as previously argued. Surprisingly, and contrary to existing theoretical frameworks (e.g., Aragon-Correa 1998; Sharma 2000; Henriques and Sadorsky 1999), proactive environmental initiatives do not appear to increase firm profitability more than reactive initiatives. Therefore, firms that go beyond regulatory requirements and focus on prevention by integrating environmental concerns into process innovation, stakeholder collaboration, employee involvement, and other proactive approaches may not necessarily expect greater financial returns than firms focusing on mere compliance or end-of-pipe methods. In either case, firms reap similar positive financial returns. Further, firms pursuing both strategies do not appear to benefit more than firms taking either a proactive or reactive approach. Perhaps there is still enough “low-hanging” fruit available for end-of-pipe solutions to be still profitable, although this could change over time as they run out. It is possible that proactive efforts are more comprehensive and thus more costly since they are not targeted at resolving a specific problem. Therefore, these efforts may lead to more costs and do not necessarily lead to direct revenue benefits. Reactive efforts would be more targeted and less costly. They also may reduce fines paid and still allow firms to capitalize on the benefits of stating that they are environmentally friendly.\n\nSome firm characteristics do influence the CEP–\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Environmental Performance (CEP) refers to the initiatives and strategies that firms implement to improve their environmental impact and sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) measures the financial outcomes and profitability of firms, often in relation to their environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S.<|>GEO<|>The United States, a country where firms reportedly benefit more from Corporate Environmental Performance compared to international counterparts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Firms based outside the U.S. that do not appear to benefit as significantly from Corporate Environmental Performance as U.S.-based firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Small firms that seem to benefit more from Corporate Environmental Performance compared to larger firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large firms that also benefit from Corporate Environmental Performance, but to a lesser extent than small firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Publicly traded companies that benefit similarly from Corporate Environmental Performance as private firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIVATE FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Privately held companies that benefit similarly from Corporate Environmental Performance as public firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES<|>EVENT<|>Concerns regarding the choice and nature of variables used in Corporate Environmental Performance and Corporate Financial Performance research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSES<|>EVENT<|>Additional analyses performed to increase the robustness of the results in the study of Corporate Environmental Performance and Corporate Financial Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>A statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies to assess the overall effect of Corporate Environmental Performance on Corporate Financial Performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEP<|>CFP<|>Corporate Environmental Performance has a significant positive relationship with Corporate Financial Performance, indicating that firms that engage in environmental initiatives tend to perform better financially.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S.<|>INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS<|>U.S.-based firms benefit more from Corporate Environmental Performance compared to their international counterparts.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMALL FIRMS<|>CEP<|>Small firms appear to benefit more from Corporate Environmental Performance than large firms.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE FIRMS<|>CEP<|>Large firms also benefit from Corporate Environmental Performance, but not as much as small firms.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLIC FIRMS<|>CEP<|>Public firms benefit similarly from Corporate Environmental Performance as private firms.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRIVATE FIRMS<|>CEP<|>Private firms benefit similarly from Corporate Environmental Performance as public firms.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Methodological issues are discussed in the context of the meta-analysis to address potential biases in the research findings.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSES<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Supplemental analyses were performed alongside the meta-analysis to enhance the robustness of the results.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
