Given the vast body of CEP–CFP studies, recently scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. However, no study so far has meta-analyzed the findings yielded by event studies assessing the stock market reactions to corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events). This paper sets out to close this gap by synthesizing previous empirical results regarding the stock market impact of positive and negative CEP-related events. Results indicate a positive relationship across studies in terms of positive market reactions to positive events and negative reactions to negative events. Furthermore, the findings show that the market reactions are stronger for negative events than for positive events (i.e., asymmetry in the stock market reaction). Finally, this study examines whether methodological artifacts (i.e., differences in the study designs) may explain the differences in the findings of the analyzed event studies.\n\n# Keywords\n\nCorporate environmental performance (CEP), Corporate financial performance (CFP), Event study methodology, Market value, Meta-analysis\n\n# Abbreviations\n\n|AR|Abnormal return|\n|---|---|\n|CAR|Cumulative abnormal return|\n|CEP|Corporate environmental performance|\n|CFP|Corporate financial performance|\n|CI|Confidence interval|\n|CSP|Corporate social performance|\n|CSR|Corporate social responsibility|\n|DJSI|Dow Jones Sustainability Index|\n|EMS|Environmental management system|\n|NRBV|Natural resource-based view|\n|UNGC|Accenture and UN Global Compact|\n\n# Introduction\n\nResearch on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been burgeoning for years and is still expanding. A plethora of empirical studies has been examining the CEP–CFP link and the question whether it “pays to be green” continues to receive unabated attention in both general media (e.g., Diamond 2009; Elgin 2007) and scholarly publications. Moreover, corporate practitioners are increasingly faced with external pressures from different stakeholders to behave responsibly toward the natural environment (Flammer 2013). According to the latest global survey of CEOs provided by Accenture and UN Global Compact (UNGC), 93 % of the 1000 surveyed CEOs believe that sustainability will be important or “very important” to the future success of their business (UNGC and Accenture 2013).\n\nWhile research rooted in neoclassical economics proposed that any discretionary efforts toward improvements of CEP would decrease profits and thus violate shareholder value maximization (e.g., Friedman 1970; Jensen 2002); other scholars have challenged this view by putting\n\n# J. Endrikat\n\nforward arguments for a positive impact of CEP on CFP. In particular, stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Parmar et al. 2010) and the natural resource-based view (NRBV; e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provided the theoretical grounds for postulating a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, empirical examinations have long yielded mixed results, ranging from findings indicating a negative relationship (e.g., Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011), to non-significant findings (e.g., Cohen et al. 1997; Graves and Waddock 1999), up to findings suggesting a positive relationship between both focal constructs (e.g., Flammer 2013; Russo and Fouts 1997).\n\nDue to the substantial body of empirical work concerned with the CEP–CFP link, scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. Three meta-analyses have recently addressed the relationship between CEP and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014).1 In essence, the meta-analytic results suggest a modest positive relationship which, however, appears to be quite complex and subject to several moderation effects arising for example from different measurement approaches, causal ambiguity, and methodological issues (Endrikat et al., 2014). Broadly, empirical research has used three different types of methodologies for examining the CEP–CFP relationship: (1) portfolio analyses comparing the financial performance of model portfolios of firms with high CEP and low CEP, (2) multivariate analyses using multiple regression approaches or structural equation models, and (3) event studies assessing the stock market impact of positive or negative corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events) (de Haan et al. 2012; Salzmann et al. 2005). The event study methodology appears particularly appropriate for examining the CEP–CFP relationship due to several reasons; for example, by focusing on stock market returns, event studies imply a forward-looking perspective on the financial consequences of CEP. Moreover, event studies evade the issue of endogeneity and are quite unambiguous with regard to the causal direction of the relationship. However, while the results of studies based on portfolio analyses and multivariate analyses have been captured by the above-mentioned meta-analyses, thus far no attempt has been made towards an integration and consolidation of the empirical evidence provided by event studies.\n\n1 In addition, there are several meta-analyses regarding the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP (e.g., Allouche and Laroche 2005\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>PERSON<|>Jan Endrikat is the author of the paper discussing the relationship between corporate environmental performance and corporate financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CEP)<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Environmental Performance (CEP) refers to a company's efforts and actions to manage its environmental impact and sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) measures a company's financial health and profitability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCENTURE AND UN GLOBAL COMPACT (UNGC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Accenture and UN Global Compact is an organization that conducts global surveys on corporate sustainability and environmental practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX (DJSI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) evaluates the sustainability performance of companies based on various environmental, social, and governance criteria.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CEP)<|>Jan Endrikat authored a paper analyzing the relationship between corporate environmental performance and corporate financial performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>Jan Endrikat's research focuses on the impact of corporate financial performance in relation to corporate environmental performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACCENTURE AND UN GLOBAL COMPACT (UNGC)<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CEP)<|>Accenture and UN Global Compact conducted a survey indicating the importance of sustainability for business success, linking to corporate environmental performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACCENTURE AND UN GLOBAL COMPACT (UNGC)<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>The survey by Accenture and UN Global Compact highlights the significance of sustainability for future business success, which relates to corporate financial performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX (DJSI)<|>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CEP)<|>The DJSI evaluates companies based on their corporate environmental performance, linking sustainability to corporate performance metrics.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX (DJSI)<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)<|>The DJSI's assessment of sustainability performance can influence corporate financial performance metrics.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
