Changes represent opportunities, which must be anticipated, prepared, and managed. Ignoring the need to implement the required changes implies not responding to new challenges and opportunities, with consequent losses at the economic, social, and environmental levels. ISI framework, described in the following sections, aims to contribute with a new insight regarding organizational change in the transition towards sustainability.\n\ncommitments, and behaviours. This adaptation should be based on a set of transversal or specific factors that produce the necessary information to adequately manage the planned sustainability dimensions.\n\n“Integrative” is understood as the capacity to align different operational and functional factors to enable the connection needed to achieve the intended organizational goal, which will define the extension and scope of the integration required (Iraldo, Testa, & Frey, 2009; Oertwig et al., 2017).\n\n“Organizational sustainability” is understood as the search for ideal dynamic states regarding TBL dimensions, based on the principles of precaution, interdependency and connections, efficiency and assessment, and integrity and equity. This search enables the development of skills that will enhance organizational evolution to new levels of assurance, balance, and healthy maintenance of the different systems and subsystems relevant for CS (Costanza & Daly, 1992; Jerónimo Silvestre et al., 2014; Lamberton, 2005).\n\n“Intelligence” is based on the concept developed by Moratis and Melissem (Moratis & Melissen, 2019) consisting of three different levels: (a) naive intelligence, (b) native intelligence, and (c) narrative intelligence. This concept is complemented with the approach of Daniel Goleman that defends different patterns of intelligence directly related with self-conscience, impulse control, persistence, enthusiasm, empathy, self-motivation, and social skills (Goleman, 1995).\n\nTherefore, “intelligence” is understood as the capacity to learn from experience and to provide rational, emotional, social, and ecologic responses in the scope of the present context and environment (Goleman, 2010; Moratis & Melissen, 2019).\n\nIn this sense, ISI translates the ability of organizations and stakeholders to apply knowledge and experience in the contexts affected by organizational impacts, enhancing alternative proposals, solutions, and proactive behaviours. These are expected to contribute to global sustainability, considering both the perspective of supply and demand/consumption.\n\n# 4.2 | ISI framework development\n\nISI framework aims to allow its users to create and develop alternatives regarding the management of uncertainties in sustainability-oriented measures, enabling the implementation of adequate control systems regarding input and output variables and indicators. ISI is expected to provide a structured, dynamic, and integrated contribution for the organizational management of alternatives regarding the achievement of a rational functional change in the scope of CS, enhancing creative converging solutions. Figure 3 shows the ISI framework structured in four phases: (a) discover; (b) create and add value; (c) value co-creation; and (d) act and consolidate. All these phases are flexible and complement each other.\n\n# 4.1 | Model conceptualization\n\n# 4.2.1 | Discover\n\nISI is defined as the material, technical, managerial, and leadership skills that an organization requires, in each moment, regarding the adaptation of its resources, emotions, motivations, expectations, knowledge required to clarify a given situation or problem, which is...\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\n# Integrative Sustainable Intelligence framework\n\nmeant to be solved or anticipated. Time spent in this stage is directly related with the required level of precision, the scope of the problem and its complexity level, the extent of the objectives, and its expected impacts. Two stages compose the “discover” phase: data and acknowledgement.\n\n# Data\n\nData are knowledge, defined as the set of structured, unstructured, and semistructured information obtained from heterogeneous sources (Sherman, 2015). In data analysis processes, the “What, Why, When, and How” set of questions is crucial to enable value creation, given its contribution to adequately understand the reality and context of the situation/problem under analysis (Verhoef, Kooge, & Walk, 2016).\n\nThe collected information should represent knowledge, should be materially important and should contribute to the understanding of the problem. On the other hand, it should enable the definition of solutions regarding the adequate procedures and behaviours that will enable the delivery of the right products and services, to the right client, on the right time and at the right amount, causing the least possible negative impact and promoting the highest possible positive impact. All these dimensions should be integrated in a business model that enables the re-assessment of procedures, behaviours, products and services, according to individual, social, environmental and economic needs, with the aim of sustainable value creation.\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\nIn the search for maintaining competitive and resilient processes, it is critical for organizations to adequately deal with and understand the available information, given the constant evolution and volatility of conditions and the unpredictability of the contexts in which they act.\n\nIn this scope, it is consensual among specialists that organizations need to develop and create skills and mechanisms for fast adaptation, flexibility and innovation, in order to timely recognize and adapt to a changing context (Kok & Driessen, 2012). Possible negative impacts and consequences will be reduced if organizations adequately and timely identify the need to implement changes.\n\nKlarner, Probst, and Soparnot (2008) define organizational change capacity as “an organization's ability to develop and implement appropriate organizational changes to constantly adapt to its environment” (Klarner et al., 2008; p. 58). According to these authors, change is not an isolated event\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
