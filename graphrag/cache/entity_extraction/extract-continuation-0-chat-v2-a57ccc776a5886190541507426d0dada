As a matter of facts, our sales volume increases because we invested in building overseas factories and online channels.” (Managing Director)\n\nLastly, the company has demonstrated its organizational resilience via several crises. Notably, it could bound back from the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis within 3–4 years, while other companies could not survive.\n\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate a close fit between Plan Creation’s business practices and the Sufficiency Thinking model. We can conclude that the knowledge and virtuous values are the foundation of the Sufficiency Thinking mindset at Plan Creation. This shared mindset is characterized by moderation, reasonableness and prudence. It is this mindset that drives corporate practices that are consistent with sustainable leadership practices. Finally, there is evidence of the expected outputs of economic, environmental, cultural and social outputs and outcomes of self-reliance, resilience and immunity at Plan Creation. Contributing to the literature, the present study helps us to enhance our understanding of the corporate sustainability process.\n\n# 6. Managerial Implications for SMEs\n\nOur study offers some important implications for practicing managers particularly the SME owners who wish to sustain their business by adopting the Sufficiency Economy philosophy. SME business leaders should identify perseverance as a required value for new employees. The recruiting process should assess a candidate whether she/he has persisted in going through difficulties. Perseverance should also be a criterion in employee performance evaluation. Perseverant employees should be publicly recognized so that other employees understand management’s expected behavior.\n\nIn addition, SME owners should start by giving priority to product, service and process innovations. Starting with continuous marketing analysis, co-creation with users, suppliers, and relevant parties should be conducted to design products or to prove processes. Local wisdom or culture shall be integrated into the new product development process or operational improvement process.\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\nCore competency shall be identified and maintained within its own companies rather than outsourcing them from others. Moreover, SME leaders should maintain a good, long-term relationship with stakeholders including suppliers, as they can be partners to develop innovative products and processes.\n\nSME leaders should take into consideration the Sufficiency Economy philosophy by balancing between a short-term and long-term view. Risk management shall be considered along with prudent decision making to make an investment or expansion. Top management should focus on long-term sustainable growth, although in doing so, it may have to sacrifice short-term profits. A policy to give priority to utilize internal capital for expansion should be carefully reviewed and formulated.\n\nAdopting a stakeholder focus approach, SME leaders should start by acting as a role model for employees. They should also be responsible for a broad range of stakeholders. They should also sponsor and participate in cultural and local activities in the nearby communities, and allow employees to join even during an office hour.\n\nFinally, SME leaders should be willing to share their knowledge with a wide range of stakeholders, including competitors, to help to educate customers and suppliers along the value chain. Ultimately, the sharing practice helps to advance the relevant market, industry and society.\n\n# 7. Future Research\n\nTypical to a case study approach, the findings here are limited by a single case company. They should be further examined quantitatively via a larger sample size from a variety of different industrial and organizational settings. Moreover, future research may consider refining the Sufficiency Thinking model by adopting a robust theory building approach such as the Integrated Theory Building Methodology [12] to develop a theory of sustainable SME management.\n\n# 8. Conclusions\n\nFindings at Plan Creation endorse the Sufficiency Thinking model as an approach to ensure corporate sustainability. At the same time, it also endorses the Sufficiency Economy philosophy as a viable approach to corporate sustainability. The present study also demonstrates how the virtues, knowledge and Sufficiency Mindset have infused throughout the business activities at Plan Creation. The findings also indicate that adopting the Sufficiency Economy philosophy leads to cultural, social, environmental and economic outputs. Future research directions, including the development of a theory of sustainable SME management, were discussed. Finally, recommendations for practicing managers were pointed out.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nThe authors contribute equally to the development of this paper.
