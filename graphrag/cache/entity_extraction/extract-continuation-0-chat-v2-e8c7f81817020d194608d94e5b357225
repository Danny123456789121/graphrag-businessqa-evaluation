First, companies may be forced to do so by the owner, members of legislation, stakeholders, or market pressures. Second, companies voluntarily pursue sustainability, either because they are ethically motivated (Wöhe and Döring, 2008) or because they expect economic benefits to be gained (Kurucz et al., 2008). In other words, the desire to integrate sustainable issues may be driven by normative considerations, ethical rationality or economic rationality. The latter can be internally derived, when sustainable actions are combined with competitive advantages, or externally derived, when a company is forced to undertake sustainable activities (Baumgartner, 2014).\n\nTo understand the business value of sustainable strategic management, the interests or utility to the company must be analyzed. Corporate sustainability management can influence the productivity and efficiency of processes, support the development of more sustainable products and services, reduce the risks associated with environmental and social impacts and improve the credentials of a company. The resulting benefits may reveal themselves in the form of an improvement in financial performance or improved competitive strength. The former may arise in the form of higher profits, reduced costs, or increases in share prices. The latter are, in turn, derived from the increased innovation capacity, enhanced public image or reputation, increased revenues, increased employee satisfaction, productivity increases, or an increase in the market share.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nFor instance, Kurucz et al. (2008) differentiated among the following four benefits of corporate sustainability management:\n\n1. reductions in costs and risks\n2. improvements in competitiveness\n3. improvements in reputation and legitimacy\n4. creation of value by seeking win-win outcomes\n\nCompanies are part of the business sector, and sustainability orientation can also enhance the competitiveness of this business sector. However, the risk of path dependency also exists. Taking only first-order sustainability performance into account (see section 3.1) can lead to situations where the overall sustainability performance of a sector is lower as compared to situations in which second-order sustainability performance is realized. For instance, improving the efficiency of a given industry structure can increase its short-term competitiveness, but lower its opportunities to shift the whole sector to a higher sustainability level (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). As mentioned above, the benefits in a narrow sense could have a positive influence on costs or revenues.\n\n# Proposition 2a:\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a narrow sense is based on reduced costs or increased revenues.\n\n# Example 2a:\n\nEnergy savings can be achieved in operations or higher margins can be gained by focusing on organic food. These so-called win-win-situations can be verified by examining the ensuing reductions in costs and environmental impact (e.g., where less energy is used to heat a building).\n\nFreeman points out the important role that stakeholders play in long-term company success (Freeman, 1984). Stakeholders may support or hinder the implementation of corporate strategies (Michelon et al., 2012). A credible CSR policy allows a company to expand its operations without incurring stakeholder resistance (i.e., on the part of neighbors, NGOs, or society, in general). It is, therefore, important that sustainability management policies are perceived as being legitimate and worthwhile.\n\n# Proposition 2b:\n\nWhen embarking on corporate sustainability, improving public and stakeholder perceptions with regard to acceptability of company activities is likely to generate economic benefits.\n\n# Example 2b:\n\nA policy of active stakeholder management (i.e., a policy that genuinely takes into account the expectations and wishes of stakeholders) can be used to heighten public acceptance of company activity.\n\nDecision makers must be open and reflect critically on their actions while considering the social and environmental aspects of products, services, processes and strategies. This is particularly true where systemic effects (i.e.,\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nSecond-order sustainability) are taken into account. Improving corporate environmental and social performance implies a readiness to engage in new ideas about how more sustainable technologies, structures, services and products can be employed and is, therefore, a potential source for organizational innovation. Moreover, a willingness to question the value of current services, products and processes, engage in critical self-reflection and provide room for organizational learning processes are fundamental for innovative activities (Vollenbroek, 2002; Schiederig et al., 2012; Bönte and Dienes, 2013).\n\n# Proposition 2c\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased innovation.\n\n# Example 2c\n\nThe integration of sustainability topics into the product design process may lead to more innovative products as compared to those generated using a conventional product design process. For instance, introducing a lightweight design in industry strengthened technological competence in several sectors.\n\nOffering sustainable products and services provides an opportunity for market differentiation and segmentation and to meet the specific demands of ‘green’ or ‘fair’ consumers. Sustainable products and services can address the needs of sustainability-oriented consumers and, therefore, help a company gain a selective advantage over its competitors. For instance, higher prices may be charged in customer segments such as LOHAS (lifestyle of health and sustainability) (Aburdene, 2007):\n\n# Proposition 2d\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased market differentiation.\n\n# Example 2d\n\nToyota’s introduction of its hybrid car “Prius” in the US is one example. In general, at the operational level, companies also need to critically analyze services\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability management refers to the strategies and practices that companies implement to manage their environmental and social impacts while achieving economic benefits.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KURUCZ ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Kurucz et al. are researchers who differentiated among the benefits of corporate sustainability management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREEMAN<|>PERSON<|>Freeman is a scholar who emphasizes the role of stakeholders in long-term company success.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOYOTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toyota is an automotive manufacturer known for its hybrid car, the Prius, which exemplifies market differentiation through sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIUS<|>EVENT<|>The Prius is a hybrid car introduced by Toyota in the US, representing a significant step in sustainable automotive technology.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KURUCZ ET AL.<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Kurucz et al. provided insights into the benefits of corporate sustainability management, influencing its practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREEMAN<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Freeman's theories on stakeholder engagement are relevant to corporate sustainability management practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOYOTA<|>PRIUS<|>Toyota's introduction of the Prius is a key example of corporate sustainability management in action<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>TOYOTA<|>Corporate sustainability management practices can enhance Toyota's competitive advantage in the automotive market<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
