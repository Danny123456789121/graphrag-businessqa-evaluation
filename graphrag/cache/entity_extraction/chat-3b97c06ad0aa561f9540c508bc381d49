This represents, on average, three ESG news per firm every month. The total number of news per firms varies approximately from 150 to 600, with a standard deviation of 110. The complete distribution is presented in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.\n\nFor each news, we know the name of the firm, the announcement date and the source. Covalence classifies ESG news into a large number of different sources that we aggregate into three categories. We consider that ESG news may come from: (i) media (including internet) and official authorities (governmental bodies, academics, international organizations), (ii) NGOs and trade unions or (iii) the firms themselves. Moreover, Covalence classifies the news into 45 criteria depending on the topic considered (see the detail in ‘‘Appendix’’ section). We group them into three broad criteria: (i) environment, (ii) social and (iii) governance.\n\n|Source|Positive News|Negative News|\n|---|---|---|\n|Media|84%|84%|\n|Firms| | |\n|NGOs| | |\n\nThis first table gives us some interesting insights. First, the main provider of ESG news is the media which disclose about 84% of the news, firms and NGOs equally sharing the rest. Moreover, the proportion of news by source is approximately the same whether one considers environmental, social or corporate governance issues. Second, our sample of news is well balanced in terms of ESG criteria even if there are slightly more news related to social issues (39% overall), than news on corporate governance (34%) and the environment (29%). Third, the part of ‘‘good’’ news relative to ‘‘bad’’ ones is very skewed.\n\n# G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit\n\n# Table 1 Number of ESG news by category\n\n| | |All sources| |Firms| |Media| |NGOs| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Environment|8829|2432|843|34|7486|1867|353|488|\n| |Social|9969|5353|1378|88|7830|4455|569|757|\n| |Governance|8371|550|964|70|6814|4201|340|915|\n| |Total|22,391|10,676|2682|166|18,751|8869|1070|1677|\n\nThis table documents the number of negative and positive ESG news included in the sample, categorized by source (the firms, the media, the NGOs) and topic (environment, social and governance). One hundred firms are considered (see the list in ‘‘Appendix’’ section) over the period 2002–2010. Data are from Covalence EthicalQuote. Given that some events have been reported by several sources and/or are related to several ESG issues, the total number of news is lower than the sum of the categories.\n\nThe number of positive news is two times larger than the total number of negative news. More precisely, the ratio of positive to negative news is 3.1 for environmental news, 1.8 for social issues and 1.5 for corporate governance. Unsurprisingly, firms are the most prone to announce good news: positive news announced by the firms themselves are 16-fold larger than negative news. ESG news from media are also biased toward positive news with a ratio slightly below two. On the contrary, NGOs disclose almost 50% more negative than positive ESG news.\n\n# Definition of the Variables\n\nAs we argued above, certain factors are likely to be associated with the effectiveness of ESG news. These factors could be classified into three categories. The impact of ESG news will depend on the nature of the news (the type, the origin, the tone, etc.), the strength of external pressures (the long-term trends, the economic environment, etc.) and the characteristics of the targeted firm (its reputation, its sector, its financial health, etc.). We describe below how we computed the variables which serve as proxies. Descriptive statistics are provided in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.\n\n# ESG Issues\n\nWe created three dummy variables E, S and G that are set to one if the news is related to environmental, social or corporate governance issues, respectively. Note that these dummy variables are not exclusive since some information involve several issues.\n\n# Sources\n\nWe created a set of dummy variables to distinguish news from the media, from the firms themselves and from NGOs (hypothesis #3). Further, we consider three dummy variables. The first one ‘‘Main newspapers’’ is equal to one when the news was published in one of the ‘‘Top 200 Newspapers in the world.’’ The second one, ‘‘Financial newspapers’’ is set to one when the news was published in a newspaper with a business or financial orientation (Financial Times, Business Week, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg.com, etc.). The last one ‘‘CSR newspapers’’ is equal to one when the news was published by a media specialized in CSR (Ethical Corporation Magazine, CSRwire, GreenBiz.com, etc.) (hypotheses #4a & #4b).\n\n# Sector’s Main Concern\n\nThe relevance of ESG news is likely to be different depending on the activity of the firm: Environmental news, for instance, have certainly a different meaning for a petrochemical firm and a bank (hypothesis #5). To capture this, we created a dummy variable equal to one when the news is related to the ‘‘main concern’’ of the firm targeted. The main concern is defined at the industry level,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
