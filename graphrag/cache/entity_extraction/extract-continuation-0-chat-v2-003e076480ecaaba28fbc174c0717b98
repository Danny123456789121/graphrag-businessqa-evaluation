Corporate sustainability deals with a multitude of demands and objectives at organizational and societal levels that appear desirable in isolation but are “inextricably connected and internally interdependent” (Bansal, 2002: 123). It therefore produces a decision-making context with highly ambiguous signals, where decision making strongly depends on the frame managers use (Bogner & Barr, 2000; Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Kaplan, 2008). First, from the perspective of sustainability, firms need to address economic as well as environmental and social outcomes, which have to be achieved simultaneously (Elkington, 1997; Gao & Bansal, 2013). This need to address various desirable but interdependent outcomes simultaneously leads to a risk of unintended consequences, since a solution to one issue could be detrimental to that of another (Newton, 2002). Second, sustainability suggests that “business firms are expected to improve the general welfare of society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 168). This reference to multidimensional outcomes at the societal level complicates the objective function of the firm (Jensen, 2001), because it comes in addition to financial performance goals at the organizational level. Because of a strong focus on intergenerational\n\nAcademy of Management Review  October\n\nfairness (WCED, 1987), sustainability also “emphasizes the long-term nature of the benefit that business is expected to provide to society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 163), as opposed to the oftentimes short-term focus of managerial decision making (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012). Third, sustainability involves the simultaneous recognition of various and often conflicting demands of a wider set of stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995; Maon et al., 2008), who apply decision logics that are different from those of managers and shareholders (Hahn, in press).\n\nOverall, sustainability confronts managers with situations in which they need to simultaneously address multiple desirable but conflicting economic, environmental, and social outcomes at firm and societal levels that operate in different time frames and follow different logics. At the same time, firms and managers are being criticized for their reluctance to adopt radical responses to address sustainability concerns (Whiteman, Walker, & Perego, 2013). To gain greater insights into corporate sustainability decision making, it is therefore critical to understand which cognitive frames managers use to cognitively process these ambiguities (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999).\n\n# Business Case Frame and Paradoxical Frame\n\nMany of the ambiguities that surround sustainability stem from the interrelated yet conflicting nature of economic, environmental, and social outcomes (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). We develop two cognitive frames that reflect decision makers’ assumptions regarding the relationship of these aspects of sustainability on the basis of work by Smith and colleagues (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), who suggest two approaches for managers to deal with ambiguities. The first approach is based on an alignment logic and reflects the “belief in a unitary truth [which] means inconsistencies cannot fundamentally coexist” (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 525). It holds that managers deal with ambiguities by trying to eliminate tensions—that is, they seek situations with a fit between various factors and look for contingencies that reconcile any inconsistencies (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Such a need to eliminate tensions resonates with the business case for corporate sustainability, which argues for an alignment of social and environmental outcomes with financial performance (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, & Steger, 2005). We therefore label the first cognitive frame the business case frame.\n\nThe second approach of Smith and colleagues stipulates that in complex organizational contexts tensions and inconsistencies are highly salient and cannot be eliminated (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). It emphasizes that by using paradoxical thinking managers accept tensions and accommodate conflicting yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns, rather than eliminate them (Gao & Bansal, 2013; Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Accordingly, we label the second cognitive frame the paradoxical frame (Miron-Spektor, Gino, & Argote, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the two frames.\n\nThe two frames represent ideal types (Doty & Glick, 1994) in the sense of accentuated abstractions of how managers conceive of the relationship between and among the economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. Representing the end points of a continuum, the two ideal-type frames conceptualize this relationship by either aligning environmental and social aspects with the economic dimension (business case frame) or by accepting and accommodating the interrelated yet contradictory nature of all three aspects (paradoxical frame). Since ideal types rarely exist in pure form, the actual frames of decision makers will lie between the end points and resemble the ideal types to different degrees (\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Academy of Management Review is a scholarly journal that publishes research on management and organizational studies, including topics like corporate sustainability and decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability refers to the practice of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, often involving economic, environmental, and social considerations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cognitive Framing<|>EVENT<|>Cognitive framing in managerial decision-making refers to the mental structures that influence how managers perceive and respond to sustainability challenges and ambiguities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS CASE FRAME<|>EVENT<|>The business case frame is a cognitive approach where managers seek to align social and environmental outcomes with financial performance, aiming to eliminate tensions between these aspects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARADOXICAL FRAME<|>EVENT<|>The paradoxical frame is a cognitive approach where managers accept and accommodate conflicting yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns rather than trying to eliminate them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGERS<|>PERSON<|>Managers are individuals responsible for making decisions within organizations, particularly regarding sustainability and the balancing of various stakeholder demands.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGERS<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Managers are responsible for making decisions that impact sustainability practices within their organizations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cognitive Framing<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>Cognitive framing influences how managers perceive and address sustainability challenges<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESS CASE FRAME<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>The business case frame is a cognitive approach that managers use to align sustainability with financial performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARADOXICAL FRAME<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>The paradoxical frame allows managers to accept and navigate the complexities of sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGERS<|>BUSINESS CASE FRAME<|>Managers utilize the business case frame to reconcile tensions between sustainability and financial goals<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGERS<|>PARADOXICAL FRAME<|>Managers may adopt the paradoxical frame to deal with conflicting demands in sustainability<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
