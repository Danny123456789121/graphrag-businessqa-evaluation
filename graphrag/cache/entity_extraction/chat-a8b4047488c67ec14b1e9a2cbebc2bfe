To be sure, integration will require the development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI.\n\nWhile we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, we did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product categories. These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the performance of individual companies but in economic growth overall.\n\n# Box 2\n\n# Deep learning surrogates\n\nProduct design in industries producing physical products often involves physics-based virtual simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). Although these techniques are faster than actual physical testing, they can be time- and resource-intensive, especially for designing complex parts—running CFD simulations on graphics processing units can take hours. And these techniques are even more complex and compute-intensive when they involve simulations coupled across multiple disciplines (for example, physical stress and temperature distribution), which is sometimes called multiphysics.\n\nDeep learning applications are now revolutionizing the virtual testing phase of the R&D process by using deep learning models to emulate (multi)physics-based simulations at higher speeds and lower costs. Instead of taking hours to run physics-based models, these deep learning surrogates can produce the results of simulations in just a few seconds, allowing researchers to test many more designs and enabling faster decision making on products and designs.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Value potential by modality\n\nTechnology has revolutionized the way we conduct business, and text-based AI is on the frontier of this change. Indeed, text-based data is plentiful, accessible, and easily processed and analyzed at large scale by LLMs, which has prompted a strong emphasis on them in the initial stages of generative AI development. The current investment landscape in generative AI is also heavily focused on text-based applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. However, we estimate that almost one-fifth of the value that generative AI can unlock across our use cases would take advantage of multimodal capabilities beyond text to text.\n\nWhile most of generative AI’s initial traction has been in text-based use cases, recent advances in generative AI have also led to breakthroughs in image generation, as OpenAI’s DALL·E and Stable Diffusion have so amply illustrated, and much progress is being made in audio, including voice and music, and video. These capabilities have obvious applications in marketing for generating advertising materials and other marketing content, and these technologies are already being applied in media industries, including game design. Indeed, some of these examples challenge existing business models around talent, monetization, and intellectual property.\n\nThe multimodal capabilities of generative AI could also be used effectively in R&D. Generative AI systems could create first drafts of circuit designs, architectural drawings, structural engineering designs, and thermal designs based on prompts that describe requirements for a product. Achieving this will require training foundation models in these domains (think of LLMs trained on “design languages”). Once trained, such foundation models could increase productivity on a similar magnitude to software development.\n\n# Value potential by industry\n\nAcross the 63 use cases we analyzed, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries. Its precise impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as the mix and importance of different functions, as well as the scale of an industry’s revenue.\n\nAcross 63 use cases, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries.\n\n24  The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Exhibit 4\n\n# Generative AI use cases will have different impacts on business functions across industries.\n\n|Generative AI productivity impact by business functions¹|Total, % of industry revenue| | | | | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Total, $ billion|1,200|470|420|1,200|550|260|260|50|90|\n|Administrative and professional services|0.9–1.4|150|250| | | | | | | |\n|Advanced electronics and semiconductors|1.3–2.3|100|170| | | | | | | |\n|Advanced manufacturing|1.4–2.4|170|290| | | | | | | |\n|Agriculture|0.6–1.0|40|70| | | | | | | |\n|Banking|2.8–4.7|200|340| | | | | | | |\n|Basic materials|0.7–1.2|120|200| | | | | | | |\n|Chemical|0.8–1.3|80|140| | | | | | | |\n|Construction|0.7–1.2|90|150| | | | | | | |\n|Consumer packaged goods|1.4–2.3|160|270| | | | | | | |\n|Education|2.2–4.0|120|230| | | | | | | |\n|Energy|1.0–1.6|150|240| | | | | | | |\n|Healthcare|1.8–3.2|150|260| | | | | | | |\n|High tech|4.8–9.3|240|460| | | | |\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
