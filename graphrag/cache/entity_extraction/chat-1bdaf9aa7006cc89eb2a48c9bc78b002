This would require that the primary studies or samples used in one first-order meta-analysis not be included in any of the other analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). In fact, it is a typical case for second-order meta-analyses that this assumption cannot completely be met. Scholars therefore suggest that minimizing the lack of independence might be the best that can be expected (Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Schmidt & Oh, 2013). Various simulation analyses support this approach and find negligible effects of statistical independence violations (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001; Romano & Kromrey, 2008; Tracz, Elmore, & Pohlmann, 1992).\n\nOur approach for minimizing data dependency applied three steps: meta-analyses selection; average overlap assessment; and the elimination of overlapping studies as a robustness check. First, we selected only the most recent version of a study. We considered multiple contributions from single authors only if they had different research topics or reported different correlation coefficients for the same primary study (Orlitzky, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Second, we calculated for every meta-analysis with transparent primary studies the pair-wise overlap to each other. We determined an average overlap of 5.4% of one single meta-analysis to the rest with 78% of pairs having less than 5% overlap. Third, Wilson and Lipsey (2001) reduce disproportionate dependency in second-order meta-analysis by eliminating studies that have more than 25% primary studies in common with other meta-analyses. Thus, we eliminated all meta-analyses with more than 25% overlap to at least one other study. The results of an additional assessment to rule out distorting effects of a potential independence violation are reported in Table 6. We conclude that the level of average non-independence for this study appears small and we have no indication that it could distort effect sizes and variances significantly.\n\n# Analysis and Statistical Models\n\nWe calculated summary effects in three alternative ways and also for various subgroups and moderating factors. First, we conducted a second-order omnibus meta-analysis with all primary studies in our meta-analyses sample which contained transparent data for effect sizes. Technically, this is a traditional psychometric first-order.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

Mgmt. 2018\n\nDOI: 10.1002/csr\n\n# Corporate social and financial performance\n\nmeta-analysis (Hunter et al., 1982; Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). So-called omnibus meta-analyses have the advantage of established calculation procedures from first-order meta-analysis. Moreover, such analyses yield the same grand mean estimate, provided that all else is equal. But they also suffer from shortcomings like typically scarce data transparency at primary study level and, most important, it is not possible to estimate second-order sampling error variance and correct for it (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). This omnibus meta-analysis, to our knowledge, constitutes the largest meta-analysis in the field hitherto, based on the number of included primary studies. It combines n (1) = 551 studies with N (1) = 152,437 observations retrieved from previous meta-analyses. We utilized this first-order meta-analysis to gain a more granular understanding of the CSP-CFP relation and its statistical variation at primary study level.\n\nSecond, we calculated a second-order meta-analysis combining all meta-analytical summary effects of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25).\n\nThird, we aggregated all relevant sub-effects of these meta-analyses (m = 129) in various subgroups in order to derive more granular conclusions about the CSP-CFP relation. These sub-effects and their reliability measures provided the foundation for the calculation and correction of a second-order sampling error and the subsequent moderating factor analysis. Moreover, as part of the robustness checks, we analyzed the impact on results when changing from best-effort variances to simple variance estimates. Further documentation on the determination of effect sizes and variances, the correction for measurement error, and the assessment of heterogeneity is provided in online Supplementary Appendix SA.\n\n# Adjusting for the Second-Order Sampling Error\n\nThe second-order sampling error is comparable to adjustments for first-order measurement error variance in psychometric meta-analysis. As measurement error is the random deviation of an observed score from a true score, so is the random deviation of first-order meta-effect sizes from its actual second-order average, the second-order sampling error. Thus, the function is comparable to measurement error (Schmidt & Oh, 2013):\n\nbir = rpp bp̿\n\npi b + pb̿\n\nwhere pir is the second-order sampling error adjusted for the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate and unreliability in the first-order meta-analytic results, rpp is the reliability of i first-order meta-analytic values, pi is the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate, and pb̿ is the second-order grand mean meta-analytic estimate. The reliability coefficient rpp is 1-ProVar, which is calculated as the ratio of b2/S2p σp where b2 σp is the estimate of the actual (non-artifactual) variance across the m-meta-analyses of the population mean-disattenuated correlations. This is the variance that remains after the variance for the second-order sampling error has been subtracted from the variance of mean-disatt\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
