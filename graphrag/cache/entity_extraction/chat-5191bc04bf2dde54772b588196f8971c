Kamstra, Kramer and Levi (2003) examine how temperature affects human mood and investor behavior, but not from the climate change perspective. Fankhauser and Tol (2005) study the impact of climate change on capital accumulation, but not from the cost-of-capital perspective. Brunner (2002) analyzes the effects of the El Niño weather cycle on commodity prices and economic activity but does not consider the cost of capital. Previous finance literature has examined the interaction between weather and financial markets. For instance, Roll (1984) and Fleming et al. (2006) study how weather-related information affects, respectively, mean returns and return variances in particular weather-sensitive markets, and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) consider how weather impinges on returns by affecting trader attitudes. These studies focus on higher-frequency (daily) weather events and subsequent return realizations. Our paper focuses on a very different aspect of the interaction between weather and financial markets: the impact of lower-frequency (monthly) weather events, relating to changing perceptions of the distribution of future temperatures, on systematic risk and the economy-wide cost of capital.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\npercentage points higher on an annual basis due to temperature shocks. Based on Henry’s (2003) finding of an approximate one-to-one relationship between the cost of capital and GDP per capita growth our results imply that temperature shocks cause a 0.22 percentage point reduction in the growth rate of U.S. GDP per capita. This estimate is statistically and economically significant.\n\nA rapidly growing new climate-economy literature has drawn on exogenous temperature shocks to identify causal effects of high temperatures on production at both micro and macro levels, thereby uncovering widespread cash flow effects of temperature shocks. For instance, Fisher, Hanemann, Roberts, and Schlenker (2012) find a negative impact of high temperatures on U.S. agriculture. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) show that temperature increases at the higher end of the distribution reduce labor productivity in sectors with high exposure to weather such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; transportation and utilities; and manufacturing. Cachon, Gallino, and Olivares (2012) find that high temperatures reduce productivity and automobile production at the plant level. There is also experimental evidence that high temperatures affect labor productivity (Seppänen, Fisk, and Lei, 2006). Dell, Jones and Olken (2012) in a world sample find that temperature increases reduce not only levels but also growth rates of real GDP, particularly in developing countries. We contribute to the new climate-economy literature by investigating if temperature shocks also have discount-rate effects.\n\nOur results have important implications for climate change research. The extant climate change literature relies on a “damage function” to incorporate the effects of climate change on economic outcomes. The typical specification allows temperature variation to affect the level but\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nTo put the number in perspective, the aggregate economic costs of mitigating secular increases in temperature (designed to limit climate change to below 2°C by the end of the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels) only amount to an annualized reduction of per capita consumption growth of 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points (IPCC, 2014). Earlier studies also document a negative cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income per capita (e.g., Nordhaus, 2006; Dell, Jones and Olken, 2009). See Dell, Jones and Olken (2014) for an excellent review of the new climate-economy literature.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nnot the growth rate of output (Dell, Jones and Olken, 2014), which is inconsistent with the empirical evidence in the new climate-economy literature. Dell, Jones and Olken (2014) accordingly call for research to help understand the mechanisms underlying the temperature-growth relationship. The evidence in this paper identifies a specific mechanism through which temperature shocks impact growth. Temperature shocks have not only cash-flow but also discount-rate effects, and a large literature pioneered by Bagehot (1873) and Schumpeter (1911) shows theoretically and empirically that the cost of capital affects capital accumulation as well as innovation and productivity (e.g., King and Levine, 1993).\n\nIn a contemporaneous paper, Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) develop a long-run risks model focusing on temperature-induced disasters, and find that temperature shocks have a negative impact on asset prices. There are two major differences between Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and the present paper. First, the underlying temperature-economy linkages are different. While temperature-induced disasters drive the negative impact of temperature variation in Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015), the impact in the present paper is the result of high temperatures emphasized by the new climate-economy literature. For instance, high temperatures without disasters could still reduce labor productivity and supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014), which may help explain the negative effects of temperature shocks in earlier years when temperature-induced disasters were insignificant. Second and more importantly, the perspectives differ. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) do not disentangle the cash-flow and discount-rate effects. Given that cash-flow effects of temperature variation are well documented in the new climate-economy literature, we focus here on identifying the discount-rate effect of temperature shocks.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 states three testable hypotheses and briefly discusses the data.
