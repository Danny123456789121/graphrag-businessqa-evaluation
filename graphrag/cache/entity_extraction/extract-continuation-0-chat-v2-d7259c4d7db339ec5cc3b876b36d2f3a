Thus, in both ‘sensitivity’ meta-analyses (not reported in the tables), the mean observed and corrected correlations were positive and of similar magnitude as the correlations in the entire meta-analytic set. If anything, the sensitivity analyses suggest that our meta-analytic estimates are actually conservative estimates of the relationships between CSP and CFP.\n\n# Corporate Social and Environmental Performance\n\nTable 1 also shows analyses for two different conceptualizations of CSP. When the entire meta-analytic set was divided into two sets, that is, (a) those studies using a narrow definition of ‘social’ performance (thus excluding measures of environmental performance; k = 249, N = 24,055) and (b) studies of corporate environmental performance only (k = 139, N = 9823), the findings show that corporate environmental performance has a smaller relationship with CFP (robs = .06, ρ = .12) than do all other measures of CSP (robs = .23, ρ = .47), such as managerial principles and corporate reputations for minority hiring, for example. In the corporate environmental performance subset, the variances of observed and true-score correlations were also smaller than those in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Furthermore, measurement error and sampling error explained more of the cross-study variance of robs in the corporate environmental performance subset than in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Thus, the last two lines of Table 1 (entries 3.a and 3.b) demonstrate that the relatively lower correlation between corporate environmental performance and CFP is, in fact, much more consistent across industry and study contexts than the primary empirical studies would have us believe.\n\n# File Drawer Analysis\n\nIn the overall meta-analysis as in all subsequent meta-analyses, an effect size file drawer analysis was performed to address the possibility of availability.\n\n# Organization Studies 24(3)\n\n# File Drawer\n\nrefers to percentage of cross-study observed variance explained by three study artefacts: sampling error, measurement error in CSP, measurement error in CFP.\n\n# Analysis\n\n# Variance of Theory and Slack Resources Theory (Hypothesis 2, All measures of CSP, Incl.

Availability bias is one of the most common criticisms levelled against meta-analysis, in that critics of meta-analysis often suspect that published studies will report larger effect sizes than unpublished studies. File drawer analysis addresses this issue by computing the number of additional unlocated (that is, ‘lost’ or overlooked) studies needed to cause the correlation to decrease to a minimal critical level (r crit), which is set at .05 in this study. Hunter and Schmidt (1990) present the underlying assumptions and techniques of file drawer analysis. For each correlation computed in Tables 1–4, the results of the file drawer analysis are presented in the last column. As shown in Table 1, a very large number of studies (1,037) would be needed to change the overall substantive conclusions of this meta-analysis (entry 1 in Table 1).\n\n# Temporal Sequence\n\nTables 2a and 2b show the results relevant to Hypothesis 2, which suggested a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP. Consistent with that hypothesis, the primary studies supported the instrumental stakeholder and slack resources theories to about the same degree. Specifically, both the prior CFP and subsequent CFP subsets yielded observed correlations of .15, and corrected correlations of .29 (first two lines in Table 2a). Concurrent studies yielded observed and corrected correlations with CFP of .22 and .44, respectively (third line of Table 2a). Taken together, these findings suggest a virtuous cycle with quick cycle times or concurrent bidirectionality. However, the low percentages of observed cross-study variance explained by artefacts, ranging from 20 percent to 26 percent, and large true-score variances ranging from .17 to .19, indicate the presence of at least one moderator. As Table 2b shows, consistent with the overall analysis (Table 1, entries 3.a and 3.b), the results are stronger after corporate environmental measures were\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>A meta-analysis examining the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>PERSON<|>Researchers known for their work on meta-analysis techniques, including file drawer analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Authors of a study on corporate social and financial performance, contributing to the understanding of CSP and CFP relationships.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE<|>Hunter and Schmidt's techniques are applied in the analysis of corporate social and environmental performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE<|>Orlitzky et al.'s study provides foundational insights into the relationship between CSP and CFP<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
