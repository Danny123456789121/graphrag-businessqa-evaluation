Within CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP, including second-order sampling error.\n\nT. Busch and G. Friede = 0.181) vs studies = 0.163. Our Hypothesis 2c is\n\n# The Relation of CSP and Various CFP Categories\n\nIn line with Hypothesis 3a, perceptual performance yields – indeed, by some distance – the highest relation to CFP (pb i = 0.380) (Table 4). It deviates significantly at the 99% level from the CFP group average (p = 0.148), also adjusted for second-order sampling error (pb ir = 0.359). This finding clearly supports Hypothesis 3a: CSP has the strongest link to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.\n\nOperational CFP exhibits the highest CSP-CFP relation within the group of objective CFP categories (pbi = 0.222) (Table 4). The deviation with the group average (b̿p = 0.148) is highly significant. Consideration of the second-order sampling error changes the result only negligibly (pb ir = 0.216). This clearly supports Hypothesis 3b.\n\nAccounting-based measures of CFP are more highly correlated (pbi = 0.161) with CSP compared to other market-based measures: growth measures (pbi = 0.124), market-based CFP measures (pb i = 0.115), and risk measures (pb i = 0.062). Even though all these category results are significantly different from zero, market-based CFP and risk measures return significantly lower correlations compared to other CFP measures (Table 4). These findings support Hypothesis 3c.\n\nIn accordance with Hypothesis 3d, we obtain the lowest correlation of all CFP categories (b = 0.016) for CSP mutual funds. It is the only result within the CFP categories which is not significantly different from zero. Nonetheless, if we adjust for the low statistical reliability of the CSP mutual fund relation (1-ProVar = 0.00), a correction for the second-order sampling error towards the average group effect b̿p becomes necessary (outlined in Equation 1). The difference between pb i and pb ir of 0.132 could be a reflection of the overall ‘noise’ – whether statistically or capital markets induced. We, thus, support Hypothesis 3d and conclude that mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to other CFP categories. Figure 2 graphically summarizes the range and magnitude of the main effect sizes.\n\n# Moderating Factors\n\nOur initial assessment reveals that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes compared to older studies. Measured by either the meta-study publication year (pbi = 0.130 vs pbi = 0.216) or the average.\n\nFor the purpose of this second-order meta-analysis, we changed the algebraic sign for CFP risk for calculation reasons. The stated positive CSP/CFP risk correlation means in fact a reduced CFP risk with increased CSP.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.
