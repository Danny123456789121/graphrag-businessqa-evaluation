Some researchers argue that both differentiation and integration are indispensable for the organization (Smith and Tushman, 2005; Smith and Lewis, 2011) and can be utilized ambidextrously to produce a synergistic effect. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) came up with a segmenting–bridging–demarcating loop whereby both integration and differentiation are applied to daily work. When entering the German market, an Islamic bank uses polyphony (segmentation) to support individuals’ practices and polysemy (integration) to provide uniformity, which combine to foster organizational elasticity (Gümüsay et al., 2020). However, it is noteworthy that the current literature fails to answer the extent to which the firm should differentiate between and integrate its competing economic, social, and environmental goals simultaneously.\n\nExisting research has investigated other proactive paradox management practices. First, well-utilized communication, as is important in the CSR research (e.g., Zhao et al., 2020), could be a vital method to engage in the sustainability paradox. A good example could be the transformation from self-persuasive rhetoric to the three-step agonistic CSR rhetoric (Winkler et al., 2020). By using (1) invitational rhetoric to define visions as provisional and revisable, (2) listening rhetoric to understand the reasons for dissension, and (3) rearticulation rhetoric to transfer authority from the speaker to the audience, the dynamic communication process finally leads to a virtuous cycle. Apart from internal conveyance, external communication strategies emphasizing the firms’ commitment to the environment, which may be further reinforced by third-party certifications, could maintain customers’ trust (Daddi et al., 2019).\n\nSecond, ongoing engagement of stakeholders helps them to live with paradoxes, as their expectations of conflicts are the primary source of paradoxical tensions. The interaction between managers and stakeholders could be regarded as a process of knowledge co-creation, generating the “power from below” to reshape the power relations to manage the tensions (Bolton and Landells, 2015), and the proactive engagement of both internal and external stakeholders could lead to mutual appreciation (Slawinski et al., 2020) to further address the paradoxical issues.\n\nThird, some researchers regard paradoxical thinking itself as a valid approach to handle tensions, but the guardrails—leadership expertise, formal structures, stakeholder relationships—are still needed to keep the practice on track (Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020).\n\n# Defensive strategy\n\nExisting research favors investigating the proactive kind of responses to the sustainability paradox. However, in practice, companies often adopt defensive actions (Lewis, 2000; Smith and Lewis, 2012). When an organization’s primary goal is threatened (e.g., by institutional complexity), the organization tends to react defensively to minimize internal conflicts and/or external threats to its legitimacy. In the organizational paradox literature, a focus on defensive reactions to paradoxical situations has generated a vast array of categorizations (see Schad et al., 2016, for a recent review). For example, Lewis (2000) divides defensive reactions into six categories: splitting, projection, repression, regression, reaction formation, and ambivalence (Lewis, 2000; Iivonen, 2018). To blame a scapegoat, which is actually the combination of splitting and projection, and to simply repress unpleasant emotions and thoughts are much more heatedly discussed than other defensive reactions in the current corporate sustainability paradox management literature (Vince and Broussine, 1996). Personal framing, such as looking at a big picture or making favorable comparisons, could also be regarded as an effective defensive mechanism to neglect problematic elements (Child, 2020).\n\nIn addition, some researchers observe that firms adopt defensive actions to transfer tensions to their external stakeholders, such as customers. For example, Iivonen (2018) points out that the Coca-Cola Company completely denies the tensions between its economic goals and the obesity problem, blaming customers for their irrational choices and lack of self-regulation. Another example is the practice of the European Oil and Gas Supermajors, which reduce or avoid tensions through impression management (Ferns et al., 2019). By making use of three myths—the techno-fix, the Promethean oilman, and climate partnerships—these companies have successfully legitimized their environmentally harmful businesses. Daddi et al. (2019) also investigate how paper producers, textile companies, and tanneries tried to balance environmental engagement and competitiveness through defensive strategies. To obtain recycled raw material, the paper producers focused on improving their competitiveness through more significant technological inputs or improved selection management. For instance, to avoid such tension arising from paradoxes, a tannery that produced high-quality leather for luxury brands directly sold.\n\n# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\nchrome (a material used to produce leather) recovered from the process to tanneries that produced inferior leather. In general, organizations tend to adopt defensive responses when their core business collides directly with sustainability development, as they consider these contradictions to be irreconcilable and threatening their survival (Iivonen, 2018; Daddi et al., 2019).\n\n# Factors spurring proactive actions\n\nThe academic community concurs that defensive reactions would create negative feedback loops (Smith and Lewis, 2011) and ethical hazards (Hall et al., 2007) in the long run. Some researchers have investigated the individual and environmental factors that could encourage a proactive response and promote a virtuous cycle. Several scholars have reiterated the role of individual factors, including cognitive and behavioral complexity and emotion regulation, in the dynamic equilibrium model, among others (Corner and Pavlovich, 2016; Hahn et al., 2016; Waldman and Bowen, 2016; Slawinski\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ISLAMIC BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An Islamic bank that utilizes polyphony and polysemy to support practices and provide uniformity in the German market)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN MARKET<|>GEO<|>The market in Germany where the Islamic bank is entering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility practices that organizations engage in to manage sustainability paradoxes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMETS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who proposed the segmenting–bridging–demarcating loop in organizational practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHAO ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who emphasized the importance of communication in CSR research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINKLER ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who discussed the transformation of CSR rhetoric)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DADDI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who investigated how companies balance environmental engagement and competitiveness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOLTON AND LANDELLS<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who discussed the interaction between managers and stakeholders in knowledge co-creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEWIS<|>PERSON<|>A researcher who categorized defensive reactions to sustainability paradoxes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Companies that adopt defensive actions in response to sustainability paradoxes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN OIL AND GAS SUPERMAJORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large oil and gas companies in Europe that manage tensions through impression management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCA-COLA COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A company that denies tensions between its economic goals and the obesity problem)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISLAMIC BANK<|>GERMAN MARKET<|>The Islamic bank is entering the German market to expand its operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>ISLAMIC BANK<|>The Islamic bank engages in CSR practices to manage sustainability paradoxes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMETS ET AL.<|>WINKLER ET AL.<|>Both are researchers contributing to the understanding of organizational practices in CSR<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHAO ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Zhao et al. emphasize the importance of communication in CSR practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DADDI ET AL.<|>FIRMS<|>Daddi et al. investigate how firms balance environmental engagement and competitiveness<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOLTON AND LANDELLS<|>FIRMS<|>Bolton and Landells discuss how firms engage stakeholders to manage tensions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEWIS<|>FIRMS<|>Lewis categorizes defensive reactions that firms adopt in response to sustainability challenges<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCA-COLA COMPANY<|>FIRMS<|>Coca-Cola Company is an example of a firm that adopts defensive actions regarding sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN OIL AND GAS SUPERMAJORS<|>FIRMS<|>European Oil and Gas Supermajors manage tensions through impression management strategies<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
