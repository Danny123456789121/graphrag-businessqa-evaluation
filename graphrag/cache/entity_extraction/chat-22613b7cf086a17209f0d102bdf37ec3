The company analysed a set of over 900 occupations and concluded that roughly two thirds of occupations existing in the U.S. are to some degree exposed to automation as an effect of the implementation of AI technologies. In the same report the company estimates that only natural language generation technologies (which is a subset of GAI technologies) could drive a 7% increase of global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over the period of ten years (Goldman Sachs, 2023). It is worth remembering that such far-reaching estimations are done upon the technology that is still very early in its adoption cycle and we are only now starting to discover possible applications which either improve the productivity of humans or replace some of their tasks entirely. Any global economic predictions at this stage can be vastly underestimated. According to the EU Parliament’s Think Tank report from 2020, “14% of jobs in OECD countries are highly capable of automation and another 32% could face substantial changes” (European Parliament, 2020a; see also Michael, 2023).\n\nWhile most of the recent tech industry lay-offs and restructuring projects cannot be attributed to GAI technologies it seems likely that software engineering will become one of the industries most heavily affected by GAI technology. In principle the creation of source code is to a large extent a repeatable act which is subject to optimization and refinement by application even of non-AI methods. Even currently available GAI tools such as ChatGPT can easily create a working code basing on instructions or descriptions given in the English natural language. Already now several companies offer GAI-powered automated source code generators. One of these products is GitHub Copilot (GitHub, 2023). The company promotes the product this way: “Spend less time creating boilerplate and repetitive code patterns and more time on what matters: building great software. Write a comment describing the logic you want and GitHub Copilot will immediately suggest a code to implement the solution” (GitHub, 2023). Apart from code generation tools providers also offer code completion tools—where the AI model predicts the next elements of the source code based on what the software engineer is typing. There is also a rise of code review solutions powered by GAI such as Amazon.\n\n# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023\n\nCodeWhisperer that look at the human-generated code and suggest optimizations, improvements or simplifications—to create a cleaner, more consistent, efficient and secure code. CodeWhisperer can also be used in code generation mode and is described thus:\n\nIt comprehends comments expressed in natural language, creates code based on the developer’s objectives and corresponds to the developer’s style and patterns. Additionally, while typing, CodeWhisperer offers suggestions to complete the comment. Users have the option to accept the top suggestion, view additional recommendations, or proceed with writing their own code. (Dilmegani, 2023)\n\nCurrently it seems likely that the professions that are required to compile and analyse huge sets of data are at particular risk of being automated by GAI technologies. This includes legal, para-legal, financial analysis and advisory branches. Because GAI models can be trained on complete sets of data and given the ability to consolidate information they are able to compile all available information (in the training set) to formulate a precise legal or financial recommendation. There are reports of ChatGPT passing law (scoring in the top 10%), medical or business examinations. As mentioned in the previous section of this article—depending on the business model and sophistication of the technology AI generated analysis can be considered either at the entry level or at a premium level when compared to a human-based service.\n\nAnother group of employees whose work is likely to be supplemented or replaced by AI technology are content creators and people working with customer support. Because GAI is becoming increasingly consistent, factually correct and fluent in content generation and interaction with humans it will be used to automatically generate media content (subject to be consumed by people and in many cases to boost advertising revenue of the medium publishing such content). Also the technology will soon improve the user experience in interaction-based areas such as customer support way beyond the basic chatbots that currently are used mainly in the first level of support and can only solve the most basic and well scripted issues. Very recently IKEA the well-known furniture and home decoration chain announced that it has retrained 8.500 customer support call centre workers to become “interior design advisors” while customer support duties are increasingly handled by their AI agent, “Billie”. The system has handled 47% of call centre inquiries over the past two years.\n\n# 2.3. The summary of the expected impact\n\nIt can be assumed that the adoption of generative AI technologies will drive a structural change in the global job market. Within several years some profes-\n\n# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy\n\nsions may be partially or completely replaced by automation. In principle the more the profession relies on “data to consolidated output” flow, the more likely it is to be replaced by AI. This process started before the dawn of powerful GAI models a rapid acceleration is likely to be seen henceforward. On the other hand, it is certain that some of that impact will be compensated for by the demand for new professions, ranging from the extremely specialized to entry level. It is interesting to note that the jobs such as prompt engineer did not exist before the mass adoption of AI technologies.\n\n# 3. Generative AI as a disruptive technology\n\nThere are multiple business models and approaches that allow emerging technologies such as GAI, to disrupt the market. One of the strategies to disrupt the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
