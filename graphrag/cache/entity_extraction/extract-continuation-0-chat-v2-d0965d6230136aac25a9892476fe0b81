SOX required increased independence of boards, which potentially created new opportunities for women to serve on boards. In 2009, the SEC introduced Regulation S-K, which enhanced proxy statement disclosures, including those pertaining to board diversity. Specifically, the “comply-or-explain” provision 407(c)(2)(vi) of this rule requires firms to disclose whether and how nominating committees consider diversity in identifying nominees for directors. As reported in Table 2, we find that shareholder support appears to be increasing over time and highest following Regulation S-K, although we have few proposals that were voted on after Regulation S-K was introduced.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nInsert Table 2 about here\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nWe observe two key types of proposals: proposals that call for the company to increase diversity, either by making an explicit commitment to do so, to make greater efforts to locate qualified candidates, or to adopt a formal process of inclusiveness; or, proposals that call for the company to report on diversity, either on its efforts to diversify the board, the criteria for selecting board candidates, or on the selection process. Shareholder support does not vary significantly across these two types of proposals. We also report voting across proponent identity, with the highest support for proposals presented by institutional investors and lowest for those from individual investors.\n\n# Why Diversity Matters - Proponent Arguments\n\nTo better understand proponent motivations and to validate our classification scheme, we compare the arguments put forth by the two types of proponents – financially- versus socially-motivated. We obtain these arguments from the text of the proposals included in the firm’s proxy statement. Results are reported in Table 3. After reviewing all of the proposal texts, we identify seven primary themes: current status on diversity, decision-making, governance, talent pool, firm value, risk, and representativeness.\n\nAlmost all proposals, including 90.9 percent of financially-motivated and 92.9 percent of socially-motivated proposals, argue that increasing diversity leads to better decision-making by considering more perspectives, resulting in more nuanced and comprehensive solutions, or being less prone to “groupthink”. The next most common argument is that diversity increases firm value, through higher accounting and stock price performance, increased competitiveness, and by making the company more attractive to the investment community.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nThis argument is significantly more prevalent for financially-motivated proposals than for socially-motivated ones (90.9 percent versus 64.3 percent, p = 0.05), consistent with expectations. Also prevalent is the argument that diversity enhances the company’s talent pool and helps companies recruit, retain and promote the best people. Again, this argument is more prevalent for financial than social proposals (81.8 percent versus 50.0 percent, p = 0.05). In contrast, more social proposals argue that diversity is needed for greater representativeness, i.e. the board should reflect the shareholder base, customers, employees and the general population. A majority (61.9 percent) of social proposals include this argument, compared to 27.3 percent of financial proposals (p = 0.01). Arguments related to improved governance from increased diversity and to low existing levels of diversity are offered equally by both proponent types, and risk is only mentioned in three proposals.\n\nThe differences documented in Table 3 suggest that our classification of proposals as primarily either socially- or financially-motivated has reasonable construct validity, which is important in our formal hypothesis tests.\n\n# RESULTS\n\n# The Antecedents of Shareholder Activism\n\nTo examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to gender diversity, we compare firms targeted by a gender diversity proposal to a control sample of non-targeted S&P 1500 firms. As in Judge et al. (2010), we identify one-to-one matches for our sample of shareholder proposal firms based on industry, firm size, and fiscal year using the following procedure: (1) Within the same year and 2-digit SIC, we obtain matches that are within 10 percent of firm size (total assets); (2) If no match is found, we look within the same 1-digit SIC for a size match within 10 percent; (3) If no match is found, we look within the same 1-digit SIC for a size match with 50 percent. We are able to find matched controls for 140.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\ntarget firm-years. Total assets are not significantly different across the target and control groups, indicating that we have successfully matched on firm size.\n\nTo formally test our hypotheses, we estimate the following binary logistic regression:\n\nPr (Targeti,t) = α + αFemale Representationi,t-1 + αBoard Independencei,t-1 + βCONTROLt-1 + εi,t (1)\n\nThe dependent variable, Target, equals one if the firm receives a gender diversity-related shareholder proposal in year t, and zero otherwise. H1a and H2a predict that female board representation and board independence, respectively, are negatively associated with target likelihood. We measure female board representation (Female Representation) as the percentage of females on the board at year t-1. The independence of the board of directors (Board Independence) is measured as the percentage of board members who are classified as independent, defined as a person neither affiliated nor currently an employee of the company, at year t-1.\n\nFollowing Judge et al. (2010) and Ertimur et al. (2011), we control for Firm Size, defined as the log of total assets, and Profitability, defined as return-on-assets or income before extraordinary items\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a U.S. government agency responsible for enforcing the federal securities laws and regulating the securities industry, including the introduction of Regulation S-K.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGULATION S-K<|>EVENT<|>Regulation S-K is a set of rules that governs the disclosure of information by public companies in the U.S., enhancing proxy statement disclosures related to board diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOX<|>EVENT<|>SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) is a U.S. law enacted in 2002 to protect investors from fraudulent financial reporting by corporations, which also aimed to increase the independence of boards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S&P 1500<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The S&P 1500 is a stock market index that includes 1500 of the largest companies in the U.S., used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Firms refer to companies that are subject to shareholder proposals regarding gender diversity and board representation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDER DIVERSITY PROPOSAL<|>EVENT<|>A gender diversity proposal is a shareholder proposal aimed at increasing the representation of women on corporate boards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 2<|>EVENT<|>Table 2 presents findings related to shareholder support for proposals concerning board diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 3<|>EVENT<|>Table 3 reports the arguments put forth by proponents of gender diversity proposals, comparing financially- and socially-motivated arguments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEC<|>REGULATION S-K<|>The SEC introduced Regulation S-K to enhance disclosures related to board diversity, impacting corporate governance practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOX<|>SEC<|>SOX required increased board independence, which the SEC enforced through regulations like Regulation S-K<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENDER DIVERSITY PROPOSAL<|>FIRMS<|>Gender diversity proposals are presented to firms to encourage them to increase the representation of women on their boards<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 2<|>GENDER DIVERSITY PROPOSAL<|>Table 2 provides data on shareholder support for gender diversity proposals<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 3<|>GENDER DIVERSITY PROPOSAL<|>Table 3 analyzes the arguments made by proponents of gender diversity proposals<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S&P 1500<|>FIRMS<|>The S&P 1500 includes firms that may be targeted by gender diversity proposals<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
