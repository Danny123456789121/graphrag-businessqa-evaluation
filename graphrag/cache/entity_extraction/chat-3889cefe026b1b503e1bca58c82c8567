It is an appropriate metric for our research because it is a commonly reported statistics metric in the existing studies. More importantly, it provides easy interpretation and meaningful comparison across studies with different sample sizes (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). Generally, two types of effect size measures are often seen: the sizes of associations or the sizes of differences. The correlation/regression coefficient r is most commonly known because r value ranges from -1 to +1, covering no relationship (i.e., r = 0) to a perfect relationship (i.e., r = 1 or -1). A correlation between two groups may have occurred by chance. The likelihood that an effect, such as a correlation seen in the data, may be assessed by p-value—the probability that a null is correct. This probability can be affected by the size of effect and the size of the sample. Specifically, the probability goes up (or down) as the size of the effect goes down (or up) and as the size of the sample goes down (or up). Thus, estimation of p-value alone can cause problems in interpreting a single relationship. In our study, our focus is not only to test the null hypothesis but also to tell precisely how large the effects really are. That is why we calculated effect sizes in our overall effect analysis and univariate analysis. We used Cohen’s rules of thumb as a guide for interpreting these effect sizes, since Cohen was quite influential in the area of effect sizes. Cohen suggested that an r of |0.10| be considered a “small” effect size, |0.25| a “medium” effect size, and |0.40| a “large” effect size (Cohen 1988). According to Cohen’s terminology, a “small” effect size is one in which there is a real effect, but which you can only see through careful study. A “large” effect size is an effect that is big enough and/or consistent enough to be able to see it in our naked eye.\n\n# Coding Scheme\n\nTo be included in the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient (r) and sample size must be collected. The standardized mean difference effect sizes (d) and the correlation coefficients (r) can be derived from summary statistics, such as t-test, F-test and χ², etc. This information is useful in the coding process. To perform a meta-analysis, all variables are coded either 1 or 0. Variables are categorized into four main categories: general, measures-related, sample-related, and methodology-related. Within each main category, additional information on different variables is collected. The following table shows the variables used in the meta-analysis. Descriptions of variables are given in Table 1.\n\n# Methodology Used in This Study\n\n# Meta-Analytic Procedures\n\nWe employed analytic techniques prescribed by Hunter and Schmidt (2004) in our data analysis. For the main effect of corporate sustainability performance, we calculated the weighted correlation (r W) between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance measures. This overall correlation weighted each eligible study by sample size and then averaged across all studies to ensure that sampling error is accounted for in the estimation. Then the average study variance (var) was computed and the heterogeneity (Chi-squared or χ²) was estimated. A statistically significant χ² suggests the existence of moderating factors in explaining the variation in the effect of CSP on CFP. In order to interpret the significance of the correlation between CSP and CFP, we further computed the 95 percent bootstrapped confidence interval (CI BS). The merit of using the 95 percent bootstrapped confidence interval is that it provides a more powerful estimate than the traditional confidence interval because it does not require an assumption of normal distribution of data. Finally, the fail-safe sample size (NfsR) was calculated to assess the possibility of publication bias or the “file-drawer” problem. A higher value of NfsR suggests more robust and reliable results obtained.\n\n# Moderator Analysis Procedures\n\nIf the overall effect results of meta-analysis suggest the presence (a significantly high Chi-squared) of moderators, then to further examine and understand the role of moderators in the CSP-CFP relationship, we performed a weighted generalized least squares regression (GLS). Following the prior meta-analytic approach (Raudenbush, Becker, and Kalaian 1988), we used the following equations to estimate the moderating effects:\n\nb = (X'R⁻¹X)⁻¹X'R⁻¹d\n\nd = Xb + e\n\nVb = (X'R⁻¹X)⁻¹\n\nwhere d is the transformed correlation associated with corporate sustainability effect coded from the dataset; X is the matrix of\n\n# Journal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Lu and Taylor\n\n# Panel A: General Variables\n\n# Variables\n\n- General\n- Authors\n- Year\n- Journal\n- Page\n- Measures\n- CSP Measure\n- CFP Measure\n- Short Term vs. Long Term\n- Samples\n- Sample Size\n- Sample Period\n- Country\n- Multi-Industry\n- Methodology\n- Methodology\n\n# TABLE 1\n\n# Variables and Coding Scheme\n\nDescriptionThe authors of the studied paper (single, double, or multiple).The year the paper was published (posted for a working paper).The journal in which the paper was published; if it is a working paper, then it is marked as WP.The page number that the main r value\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
