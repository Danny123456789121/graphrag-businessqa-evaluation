Plan Creation’s innovations are frequently built upon its strong expertise in utilizing local and simple materials. Typically, the company develops a new product from in-house materials, which often means a partial use of its existing manufacturing equipment. Thai wisdom is also a foundation for most innovations at Plan Creation.\n\n“PlanToys located at the downstream of the supply chain. Upstream involved with growing rubberwood trees for latex. After 25 years, rubberwood trees can no longer produce latex. In the past, they were cut and burned. PlanToys is the first company which turns unused rubberwood into toys . . . In terms of product design, the founders of the company paid attention to the design. In designing, we incorporate innovation in our new eco-friendly material which comprises non-toxic composite wood from sawdust and wasted wood to make. This material is called Plan wood.” (Managing Director)\n\nIt is evident that the knowledge value influences the innovation practice at Plan Creation. However, knowledge and innovation at Plan Creation benefit not only themselves, but a range of stakeholders including its industry competitors. Plan Creation’s innovation and sharing practices allow the company to continue to incrementally and radically innovate, enhancing its own sustainability prospect.\n\nPlan Creation clearly adopts the moderation principle of the Sufficiency Economy philosophy. Essentially, the moderation principle can be seen in action here, as informed by virtuous values and knowledge at all organizational levels.\n\n“Our products have a small margin. We emphasize on quality, and we invest heavily in quality and safety which is the cause of the very small margin. Fortunately, our products were well sold in the market. Our goal is not only to make profits, but also to keep our employees work happily every day by delivering value to our customers.” (Managing Director)\n\nAdopting the moderation principle, Plan Creation, as opposed to maximizing the wealth of the owners, has increased its sales volume in a “stakeholder-friendly” manner, consistent with the sustainable leadership practices of long-term stakeholder value and independence from financial markets where maximization of short-term shareholder value is the focus. This policy is clearly endorsed by the moderation predictor for corporate sustainability identified [5].\n\n“There was a time when we wanted to double our target growth within the next 3 years. To achieve such an aggressive target, our growth rate must be 20–25% for the first year. We used the price to drive the market. In turn, our sales volume decreased although we provided promotions and discounts. We did not even achieve the target in the first year. From that year, we realized that we should not grow aggressively. Some years, the more we sold our products, the more we made loss. Our sales volume was high, but we made more loss because our capacity was limited. We increased overtime, which in turn led to lower productivity. Finally, it was not worth to do so. Eventually, we rethink how to create a more balance for our company.” (Managing Director)\n\nWith the moderation principle, future problems and crises can be prevented or their effects can be minimized since Plan Creation can respond more effectively to them. A prudent practice at Plan Creation is for example a policy to utilizing internal capital to ensure maximum independence to continue its operation both in the short and long run. In doing so, Plan Creation improves its corporate self-reliance. Its current proportion of external sources of capital are 1.9 times of internal source of capital. The company also adopts the moderation principle in its sourcing practice. Plan Creation sources materials timely, given its collective insights in a highly cyclical market and a long-lasting bond with local suppliers. The supplies are kept in a well-maintained warehouse, creating a backup for the company when there is an abrupt change in the supply market. In addition, cash flows are managed very carefully here to ensure a high degree of independence from financial institutions via its long-termed, trusted relationship with the local suppliers.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n“Our material is rubberwood from the supplier which is our subsidiary company. We have a high standard and strict requirements not to use chemical in the wood. This chemical-free wood is not easy to find from other suppliers in the market. It has to be made-to-order. We create a standard contract for suppliers which clearly states our requirements.” (Finance Officer)\n\n“The Moderation, Prudent concepts and strategic direction came from the President. The President has driven these concepts for our company not to aim to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, unlike the approach other typical companies usually adopt. For a listed company, the company needs to focus on maximizing profitability for shareholders alone, but our company aims to be “People’s Company”. We would like to provide different things to all of our employees. We do not want the highest sale volumes. Everything shall be optimized. A high revenue may lead to a high cost. Sharing per staff may be less. Employees may have to work more. This will not benefit anyone at last.” (Managing Director)\n\nAdopting the Prudence and Reasonableness principles, Plan Creation invests very carefully. Long-term oriented, Plan Creation invests only in a project that has the potential to deliver benefits in the long run. At a time where a significant investment project is considered, for example, the acquisition of new equipment, the top management team on a consensual decision-making basis needs to choose whether an existing machine can be upgraded or a new one is needed. Usually, upgrading is the most desirable option. Equipment will be acquired only when the existing equipment cannot be adapted or modified, because new equipment usually needs a large investment not only to install it but also to adjust it to fit with the entire existing operational processes and procedures.
