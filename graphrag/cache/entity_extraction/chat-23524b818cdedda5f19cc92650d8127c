Usually, upgrading is the most desirable option. Equipment will be acquired only when the existing equipment cannot be adapted or modified, because new equipment usually needs a large investment not only to install it but also to adjust it to fit with the entire existing operational processes and procedures. A well-thought practice such as this permits Plan Creation to maintain lower costs in the long run. Certainly, it enables Plan Creation to always compete better in the market.\n\nIn terms of business expansion, typical companies expand to maximize profits. However, business expansion is considered very carefully at Plan Creation. As a team, the company decides to expand only when it is clear to deliver long-term returns. In general, Plan Creation pilots the expansion first. The company continues to invest on a bigger scale only when the initial investment demonstrates a clear likelihood of long-term growth. A prudent development such as this has helped Plan Creation to protect itself from environmental shocks that may have brought about a great difficulty.\n\n“Other competitors went out of business because they did not have a strong brand or did not apply the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in their operations. There was a time when we received a contract from another company to expand our business, but we decided not to expand our factory. Nevertheless, our competitor expanded its business, which hurt them significantly during the (1997 Asian Economic) crisis.” (Marketing Officer)\n\nManifestly, the Sufficiency Mindset as endorsed by virtues and knowledge has affected the organizational practices at Plan Creation. Endorsed by the geosocial development predictor [5], Plan Creation runs its business with a keen sense of ethical responsibility to the best interests of its broad range of stakeholders. Concurrently, Plan Creation is deeply aware of all possible impacts it can create for the environment. Adopting the sustainable leadership practices of social and environmental responsibility, the company considers integrating the social and environmental responsibility into its business as something that brings a competitive advantage to the company. Obviously, this mindset leads to improving its corporate capacity to deliver the quadruple bottom line outputs.\n\n“PlanToys pays attention to community and well-being of people in neighborhood. The company takes good care of the environment around the factory. We do not have problems of waste water or smell. PlanToys always collaborates with the community; especially if we request or propose any ideas, the company always supports our ideas to improve our environment around the factory.” (Community leader)\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n“The company manages the environment and society around factory and community well. We can breathe easily. There was one time, our head of community asked for support in drug testing in people who live in community. The company and employees supported and collaborated well to ensure we lived in drug-free community.” (Villager A)\n\n“We used to request the company to help build a road and dig a canal for our community. The company was happy to help us.” (Villager B)\n\nPlan Creation gives priority to the employees whom it considers as family members, demonstrating amicable labor relations. Consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of internal succession planning, the company prefers insider managers wherever possible to make sure the corporate culture and business operation continue smoothly. Plan Creation heavily invests in leadership development. As a result, employees can replace each other when needed. Without disruption, the company can continue to produce the highest quality products. This is a demonstration of self-reliance and organizational immunity at Plan Creation.\n\n“We happily work and live like a family here. We have handicap staff who are visually impaired and they work here for more than 20 years.” (Staff A)\n\n“I trust my supervisor 100%. She knows everything about me. I can talk to her about my personal life. For example, my child got sick, my debt. The company has a very good system. Other employees can help to support my work during my absence. I used to take 45 days maternity leave. All the work ran smoothly without any problems.” (Production offer B)\n\nTo nurture a team culture and to transfer the shared organizational vision, values and culture, a “Buddy” system is set up to pair a new employee with a senior one, consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of strong, shared vision. In such a widely shared corporate culture, employee motivation and productivity are high, enhancing corporate capacity to deliver economic performance.\n\nTo ensure the highest safety for its end users, often kids, Plan Creation manufactures its products guided by the top international quality standard via its supply chain. Maintaining a good and trusted relationship with its long-term suppliers, the company source the highest quality supplies and materials. To improve productivity, Plan Creation also recognizes motivation needs among its employees such as healthcare, scholarships for their children. Indeed, a sense of trust and teamwork is created in the organization. These practices assist Plan Creation to improve its organizational capacity to deliver the quadruple bottom line outputs.\n\n“We have a long-term relationship with PlanToys. We received a special request from PlanToys for a special size of wood. PlanToys emphasizes on safety and chemical-free raw materials because this wood will be the toys for kids. Kids may put the toys into their mouth. Therefore safety and quality are the highest concern. We adjusted and improved our production process to ensure the wood is free from moth. We also enhanced our drying system.” (Supplier A)\n\nAdopting the shared virtues, Plan Creation has contributed to the community it operates in different ways. This contribution helps the surrounding community to understand Plan Creation better. Such enhanced understanding helps to prevent a problem such as protesting stemmed from the surrounding community.\n\n“We have regularly organized CSR activities. We promote a reforestation campaign with the community. We also regularly organize a reforestation activity every year by involving people in the community\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
