Different industries face different problems and external pressure might vary accordingly (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). For instance, environmental issues are undoubtedly more important for the Oil and gas sector than for the banking sector.\n\n# H 7\n\nThe impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is lower in times of economic crisis.\n\nReputation The theoretical literature on the effect of reputation on financial performance is somewhat inconclusive. On the one hand, Jones et al. (2000) and Werther and Chandler (2005) argue that CSR may serve as a “reservoir of goodwill” in times of crisis. Accordingly, we can expect that firms with good reputation experience a lower decrease of their market value after the disclosure of negative ESG news. On the other hand, Baron and Diermeier (2007) and Baron (2009) state that companies with highly visible CSR activities face increased public scrutiny.\n\n# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\nand may experience a ‘‘boomerang effect’’ in case of dis- disappointment. This is empirically conﬁrmed by Luo et al. (2012): while BP was regarded as the ‘‘greenest’’ company in the oil industry, and Exxon as the ‘‘brownest,’’ BP accidents were more likely to be reported than Exxon accidents. Kim et al. (2014) ﬁnd that CSR performance is negatively associated with future stock crash risk, which also supports the mitigating effect of CSR. Theoretically, the two approaches are equally relevant and nothing came to our attention that suggests that the goodwill effect should be stronger or weaker than the boomerang effect.\n\nFurther, it should be paid attention to the way the reputation is deﬁned. Rennings et al. (2007) point out that results may signiﬁcantly differ depending on whether the ﬁrm’s reputation is computed in respect with their industry peers or not. Empirically, they found that only the ﬁrm’s absolute reputa- tion has a signiﬁcant impact on shareholder wealth. Accordingly, we consider two versions of the goodwill hypothesis.\n\n# H 8a\n\nThe impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms in sectors with good ESG reputations.\n\n# H 8b\n\nThe impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms with good ESG reputations in comparison with their peers.\n\nGreenwashing If reputation serves effectively as a reser- voir of goodwill, it might be very tempting for a ﬁrm to appear at its best and to mislead shareholders. Such strategies are usually referred to as greenwashing, that is, the selective disclosure of positive and negative information by the ﬁrm on ESG issues. Like reputation, the impact of greenwashing is theoretically ambivalent. As stated by Lyon and Maxwell (2011), ‘‘although companies naturally want to publicize their environmentally friendly actions, they are often sur- prisingly hesitant to promote their environmental successes or to issue detailed environmental reports. Part of the reason appears to be that activists react more angrily to ﬁrms that lay claim to being virtuous, and then are discovered to have feet of clay, than to ﬁrms that never make such claims.’’ Empirically however, since there is extensive evidence of greenwashing, it suggests that ﬁrms have a net interest in this (unless one considers that they do not know where their advantage lies).\n\n# H 9\n\nThe impact of negative ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms which are prone to greenwashing.\n\n‘‘Watch your words, for they become actions.’’ Recently, several studies have shown the importance of news media content in explaining stock price variations. These works, initiated by Tetlock (2007), aim to study the impact of qualitative verbal information on shareholders. For doing so, they used content analysis (also referred to as textual analysis), which can be deﬁned as a set of methods that seek to describe in a systematic and quantitative manner the content of a text. Although the method has been used frequently in social sciences, it has become prevalent among economists only recently. We propose to build on this approach to capture some speciﬁc features of the ESG news (Krueger (2015) has followed a similar approach).\n\nWe focus here on four criteria based on the Harvard IV-4 and Lasswell Value dictionaries: economic, legal, qualita- tive and quantitative. Qualitative information is naturally more difﬁcult to process than quantitative one, and there is evidence that information with high processing costs dif- fuses slowly into asset prices. Moreover, it is likely that ESG events with a legal or economic ori- entation will have a larger impact on stock prices.\n\n# H 10a\n\nThe impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger when the articles contain words referencing to eco- nomic or legal orientations.\n\n# H 10b\n\nThe impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger when the articles contain words referencing to quantitative orientation.\n\nOut of sight, out of mind? Tavares (2003) shows that the amount of foreign aid is decreasing with the geographical and cultural distance between giving and receiving coun- tries. Engelberg and Parsons (2011), who examine earning announcements in the USA show also that the impact of media on ﬁnancial markets is inﬂuenced by the distance. Accordingly, we investigate whether the proximity between a company and where the event takes place inﬂuences the impact of ESG news on shareholders behavior and ﬁrms’ market value.\n\n# H 11\n\nThe\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
