Accordingly, when customers present a desire for sustainable production, firms should adjust and redesign the customers' offer with the purpose of adapting to the new and real market situation.\n\nRaising institution's support and policy measures (11) played a significant role in improving CS performance for Chinese automobile industry. In prior literature, the importance of institutional support and government-support measures in stimulating technological innovation was researched extensively (Veblen, 1915; Nelson, 2008). Lundvall (1992) also emphasized the embedding organizations and institutions can actively advance the role of research and development in each industry. This study has found the similar conclusion in the Chinese automobile industry. For example, in response to the policy of energy-saving and emission-reduction, Chery has undertaken many national key researches and development tasks of new energy technology, and consequently achieved a profit increase of 35.7% in 2017. This evidence proves that the institution's support and policy can push firms towards CS goal.\n\nMoreover, one of the goals of SRM is to promote resource and energy optimization, better infrastructure, and access to basic amenities, green environment through organizing synergetic involvement (C9). Organizing synergetic involvement implies firms should align stakeholders' engagement with a firm's CS target. In the real situation, firms always seek more involvement or alliances among stakeholders' in supply chain networks, for instance, China First Automobile Group (FAW) always aims at protecting and aligning its stakeholders, which has re-established it as the distributor support department to support distributors. Furthermore, existed literature has clearly suggested that synergetic involvement among stakeholders' is essential to improve CS performance (Bocken et al., 2014; Schoenherr and Speier-Pero, 2015).\n\nThis study presents three main contributions as follows: (1) it provides a theoretical contribution through collecting SRM measures/practices from previous literature and establish a comprehensive framework between SRM and CS. Thereinto, eco-efficiency, socio-environmental and socio-economic aspects were proposed to supplement TBL. (2) it provides a methodological contribution by integrating VS theory and TOPSIS method to study the interrelationship between SRM and CS, as well as gathering social media information and transfers them into corresponding entropy weight and make an improvement to efficiently reduce time consumption of decision making. Additionally, the result of sensitivity analysis shows that the integration with social media data can help effectively eliminate the subjective judgement, as well as identify practical gaps in real situation. (3) the obtained analytical results in this study can help decision-makers to select the decisive SRM practice which can be used to provide precise guidelines for Chinese automobile industry towards CS goal.\n\nThis study has several limitations that need future studies to overcome. First, the selected 21 SRM practices may not enough to reveal the real situation, thus future study may require taking more proper SRM practices into account. Moreover, this study proposed VS-TOPSIS to measure the geometric interrelationship among alternatives, while the causal relationship cannot be reflected. Hence, future study may need to consider further modifying this method.\n\n# 6.
