The framework operationalized in this study is shown in Figure 3. Fuzzy Delphi proposed by Hsu et al. [88] has been adopted in this study to finalize corporate sustainability criteria. The advantage of Fuzzy Delphi over the conventional Delphi method is that the latter is a lengthy process of obtaining a consensus on experts’ opinions. The expert’s opinion in the conventional Delphi method often suffers from low convergence, which ultimately complicates consensus-building. The experts are therefore consulted repeatedly to reform their feedback so that a possible consensus can be reached. On the other hand, Fuzzy Delphi can obtain experts’ consensus through only one round of investigation [89]. The Fuzzy Delphi uses membership functions to characterize the experts’ feedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.\n\nRegarding the development of the fuzzy membership degrees, most of the previous studies used a Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN), Gaussian fuzzy number, and trapezoidal fuzzy number [88]. This study employs TFNs, to construct the membership degree function. To find the converging point of the decision group, TFNs were solved using the geometric mean following previous studies such as [90,91]. In taking this approach, a FAHP methodology was used for computing the weights of the main and sub-attributes of corporate sustainability, supported by decision-makers, using a pairwise comparison matrix. To carry out the analysis, eight academic and industrial experts were involved whose detail is provided in Appendix A (see Table A1).\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\nfeedback.

The MCDA framework used in the study.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process\n\nThe Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a well-known and adaptable Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to solve complex problems used across a variety of fields of research. The logic of AHP is based on a ratio scale to quantify the different sets of alternatives priorities provided by decision-makers [92]. This approach evaluates the consistency and importance of the decision-makers’ instinctive opinions to provide an optimal solution for complex problems. Researchers have integrated the AHP approach with other methods, such as grey system theory, data analysis envelopment, fuzzy system theory, and even linear programming [93].\n\nAlthough AHP methods have shown satisfactory results and can be used to evaluate decision-makers’ opinions, this technique has some deficiencies in terms of human behavior and thinking approach. Hence, the traditional method has some limitations, such as (i) handling with the inconsistent and unbalanced expert opinion scale, (ii) unable to handle the uncertain and ambiguous relationship with expert’s judgment numbers, (iii) imprecise results, and (iv) decision-makers’ subjective opinion preferences.\n\nDue to these limitations, AHP has evolved into FAHP, as a widely used and more accurate approach over conventional methods to solve uncertain and complex problems involving a decision-maker’s judgment. FAHP is the combination of traditional AHP and Fuzzy set theory, where the membership of each element is represented by a function. Further, each element of the membership function is divided into the membership’s degree with a value between 0 and 1, which implies that any membership’s element has a value of “1”. Conversely, any element has no membership with a “0” value. Those elements which lie between “0 and 1” have a partial or incomplete degree of membership [94]. To effectively handle the uncertainties during the logistic estimation process, there is a need to convert the linguistic term of membership function into ‘fuzzy numbers’, meanwhile, in FAHP, linguistic values are shown as a TFN.\n\nTo develop corporate sustainability for the purposes of this study, FAHP was applied to estimate weights of criteria and sub-criteria in the six following steps:\n\n1. Designing the problem structure using a hierarchical approach\n2. Constructing of pairwise comparison matrix and developing the scale of the relative importance\n\nAfter designing the problem structure in a hierarchical way, the next step is to define the scale of relative importance in order to construct a pairwise comparison matrix. Table 3 presents the TFN, which are from 1 to 9, and are used to improve the accuracy of the traditional model. We employed (˜ 3, 5, 7, 9) relative to correspondence number for expert qualitative assessment in five TFNs in order to capture the vagueness and remove uncertainties. The fuzzy membership for attributes and sub-attributes is shown in Figure 4.\n\n|Linguistics Values|Triangular Fuzzy Numbers|Fuzzy Number|AHP Equivalent|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Extreme importance/preference|(7,9,11)|˜9|9\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FUZZY DELPHI<|>EVENT<|>Fuzzy Delphi is a method used to obtain consensus from experts through a single round of investigation, improving upon the traditional Delphi method.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAHP<|>EVENT<|>Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is a decision-making framework that combines traditional AHP with fuzzy set theory to handle uncertainties in expert judgments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability refers to the management of a company's operations in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a process used to evaluate and prioritize different alternatives based on multiple criteria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIANGULAR FUZZY NUMBER<|>EVENT<|>Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN) is a type of fuzzy number used in decision-making processes to represent expert opinions and handle uncertainty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>PERSON<|>Decision-makers are individuals involved in the process of making choices or decisions based on various criteria and expert opinions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAHP<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>FAHP is applied to estimate weights of criteria and sub-criteria for developing corporate sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUZZY DELPHI<|>FAHP<|>Fuzzy Delphi is used to finalize corporate sustainability criteria, which are then evaluated using FAHP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS<|>FAHP<|>FAHP is a widely used approach in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to solve complex problems<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIANGULAR FUZZY NUMBER<|>FAHP<|>Triangular Fuzzy Numbers are utilized in FAHP to improve the accuracy of decision-making processes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>FAHP<|>Decision-makers provide qualitative assessments that are essential for the FAHP process<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
