In this functionalist view, concepts are understood in terms of what they do (e.g. how they explain reality) instead of what is assumed about the nature of reality that the concept refers to (e.g. what that part of reality is essentially like even if there exists no feasible way of ever truly knowing what it is like). In this view, which Goertz (2005) develops for social science concepts, our conceptual understanding of a phenomenon therefore evolves with our empirical understanding of how the phenomenon denoted by the concept interacts with other phenomena.\n\nOne might object, as an anonymous reviewer did, that ‘hardwiring’ causal knowledge on the consequences of CSR into the conceptualization of strategic CSR would frustrate these causal claims from empirically being tested. This is a legitimate concern for empirical research indeed, as has previously been explained in the literature (Mackenzie, 2003; Mackenzie, Podsakoff, & Podsakoff, 2011) and which has also been acknowledged by Goertz (2006, p. 65–67). For three reasons, however, we do not believe this concern to burden our evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR, however. First, as we have indicated in the body of the text, developing strategic concepts by inferring them from performance differentials between firms is well-established in the field of strategic management, given its field-defining objective of explaining firm competitive advantages from observed performance differentials between firms. In any academic field, however, an important part of conceptually understanding a phenomenon will result from making sense of how the phenomenon causally influences other phenomena.\n\nSecond, as the main aim of this study is to develop the concept of strategic CSR based on the body of causal knowledge and empirical evidence already available at this time, we are not overly worried about these claims being pre\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER-SCHMIDT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hunter-Schmidt is an organization involved in research related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its effects on firm performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRM REPUTATION<|>EVENT<|>Firm reputation refers to the perception of a company's overall quality and reliability in the eyes of stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDER RECIPROCATION<|>EVENT<|>Stakeholder reciprocation involves the mutual exchange of benefits between a firm and its stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRM RISK<|>EVENT<|>Firm risk pertains to the potential for financial loss or other adverse outcomes that a company may face.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INNOVATION CAPACITY<|>EVENT<|>Innovation capacity is the ability of a firm to develop new products or services and improve existing ones.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>CFP stands for Corporate Financial Performance, which measures a company's financial health and profitability.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER-SCHMIDT<|>CSR<|>Hunter-Schmidt conducts research on the impact of CSR on firm performance and reputation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>FIRM REPUTATION<|>CSR initiatives can enhance a firm's reputation among stakeholders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>STAKEHOLDER RECIPROCATION<|>Effective CSR practices can lead to positive reciprocation from stakeholders<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>FIRM RISK<|>Implementing CSR can mitigate certain risks faced by firms<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>INNOVATION CAPACITY<|>CSR can drive innovation within firms as they seek sustainable practices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>There is a correlation between CSR activities and improved corporate financial performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRM REPUTATION<|>STAKEHOLDER RECIPROCATION<|>A strong firm reputation can lead to better stakeholder relationships<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRM RISK<|>CFP<|>Higher firm risk can negatively impact corporate financial performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INNOVATION CAPACITY<|>CFP<|>Increased innovation capacity can lead to better financial performance<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
