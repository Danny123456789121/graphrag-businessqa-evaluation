Scholars and investors have published more than 2000 empirical studies and several review studies on this relation since then. The largest previous review study analyzes just a fraction of existing primary studies, making findings difficult to generalize. Thus, knowledge on the financial effects of ESG criteria remains fragmented. To overcome this shortcoming, this study extracts all provided primary and secondary data of previous academic review studies. Through doing this, the study combines the findings of about 2200 individual studies. Hence, this study is by far the most exhaustive overview of academic research on this topic and allows for generalizable statements. The results show that the business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded. Roughly 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation. More importantly, the large majority of studies reports positive findings. We highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP appears stable over time. Promising results are obtained when differentiating for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, regions, and young asset classes for ESG investing such as emerging markets, corporate bonds, and green real estate.\n\nKeywords: second-order meta-analysis; vote-count studies; financial performance; ESG criteria; business case\n\n# Introduction\n\nClose to 60 trillion US Dollars in assets under management – or 50% of the total global institutional assets base – are currently managed by Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) signatories (PRI 2015a). On the one hand, this development clearly demonstrates the commitment of financial markets toward environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria within investment decisions. However, on the other hand, far-reaching shifts of mainstream investors toward embracing sustainable investment practices remain rather slow (Reynolds 2014; Busch, Bauer, and).\n\n*Corresponding author.

Less than a quarter of investment professionals consider extra-financial information frequently in their investment decisions (EY 2015) and just about 10% of global professionals receive formal training on how to consider ESG criteria in investment analysis (CFA Institute 2015). For many, the business case for responsible investing seems not obvious (Feri 2009; Cohen et al. 2011; Riedl and Smeets 2015). Still, the question of how compatible ESG criteria are with corporate financial performance (CFP) has remained a central debate for practitioners and academics alike for more than 40 years.\n\nThough there are many positive examples for the ESG–CFP relation, researchers often claim that results are ambiguous, inconclusive, or contradictory (Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Rowley and Berman 2000; van Beurden and Gössling 2008; Hoepner and McMillan 2009; Revelli and Viviani 2015). Scholars and practitioners are, in particular, undecided about the general effect including its measurement and durability (Barnett 2007; Devinney 2009; Wood 2010; Orlitzky 2011; Borgers et al. 2013\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment publishes research on the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>PERSON<|>Gunnar Friede is one of the authors of the study on ESG and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>PERSON<|>Timo Busch is one of the authors of the study on ESG and financial performance and is affiliated with the University of Hamburg.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALEXANDER BASSEN<|>PERSON<|>Alexander Bassen is one of the authors of the study on ESG and financial performance and is affiliated with the University of Hamburg.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management is the organization where Gunnar Friede is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Hamburg is where Timo Busch and Alexander Bassen are affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESG CRITERIA<|>EVENT<|>ESG criteria refer to the environmental, social, and governance factors that are considered in investment decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Corporate financial performance (CFP) is a measure of a company's financial health and profitability.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>Gunnar Friede is an author of the study published in the Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>Timo Busch is an author of the study published in the Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEXANDER BASSEN<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>Alexander Bassen is an author of the study published in the Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUNNAR FRIEDE<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT<|>Gunnar Friede is affiliated with Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIMO BUSCH<|>UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG<|>Timo Busch is affiliated with the University of Hamburg<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEXANDER BASSEN<|>UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG<|>Alexander Bassen is affiliated with the University of Hamburg<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESG CRITERIA<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>The study investigates the relationship between ESG criteria and corporate financial performance<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
