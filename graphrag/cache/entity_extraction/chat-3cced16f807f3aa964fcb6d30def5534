The basic idea of weighting is to give higher weights to studies with more precise ES estimates, and the reciprocal of variance for each comparison is used as weights. When aggregating ESs, we use either a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model, depending on the assumption for variability. Details are in the Appendix. In addition, we delve into the possibility that SRI impacts on financial performance may vary systematically according to moderators and thus perform meta-regression analysis (Lipsey, 2001).\n\n# 3.2. Variable Definitions\n\nTable 2 summarizes all moderators and variables including dependent variables, either ESs or AESs. We split moderators into two broad categories, one for sampling and the other for methodology.\n\n# 3.2.1. Sampling.\n\nIn order to investigate sampling issues, we establish moderators for time, publication status, researcher background, control groups, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds. Each moderator can have more than one variable to test a hypothesis, and variable definitions are shown in Table 2. For example, three variables are used to test publication status. Since publication bias is about statistical significance, we use two variables, Publication and Significance. In addition, we use a Quality variable to examine whether there is a systematic difference in AES according to journal quality. To examine the influence of control groups on ESs and AESs, we use two variables. SRP_CI is used to test Hypotheses 5-1 and 5-3 and SRI_CI is used to test Hypothesis 5-2.\n\n# 3.2.2. Methodology.\n\nAs for methodology, we investigate issues related to variable adjustment (risk adjustment, portfolio weighting scheme, data accuracy), adding independent variables (multi-factor model, conditional model) and a matching procedure. To see the impact of the matching procedure, we also use two variables, Matching and Match_N.
