Industrialisation may have brought significant increases in wealth and welfare historically, but it has undoubtedly also contributed to the increase in resource use that is driving the current climate emergency (McNeill, 2011). From the sustainability perspective, AI continues our current trajectory of massively escalating our per capita energy use, with all the environmental degradation that entails.\n\n# 2.1.1 Research agenda\n\nHistorical research may help us better understand how societies, organizations and employees respond to the transformations wrought by technology – from the Luddites destroying machines in the nineteenth century (Thompson, 1966) to the Dot-com boom and bust at the turn of the 21st century (Goldfarb & Kirsch, 2019).\n\n- What are the factors that determine how fundamentally a technology disrupts business models and professionals' identities?\n- As AI tools are becoming more ubiquitous in businesses and workplace, how will employees integrate these tools and ‘co-pilots’ into their work?\n- Even now, the predecessor to Google's BARD, the BERT algorithm, is freely available and has been used to support information gathering and analysis (Venkata et al., 2021). Will AI be used entrepreneurially by individuals who tailor them for their specific professional uses, or will AI remain under the control of large corporations?\n- How will AI adoption affect value perceptions of the outputs produced?\n\nFrom the perspective of organisations and their employees, it remains difficult to say whether AI will have positive effects (enabling individuals to be more productive, with greater scope for personal development) or negative\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 11\n\noutcomes (reducing the scope for human decision-making and creativity, coupled with ever greater psychological pressures from increased expectations for productivity and performance). Very likely the effects will be felt differently across organizations and roles, but it will certainly have an impact on most people in some form. Generative AI systems like GPT-4 are still in their early days. Performance of these systems is close to that of humans and one could argue that they could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system (Bubeck et al., 2023). AI does not have to become “perfect”, it only must become “better” than us and in many ways it is already.\n\n# 2.2 Open Resource Based View – ChatGPT and strategy to deploy it within HRM\n\nJaap Paauwe10 and Paul Boselie11\n\n# 2.2.1 Introduction\n\nContemporary strategic human resource management (SHRM) builds on human capital and resource-based view (RBV) notions that given the right circumstances employees (human resources) can be a source for sustained competitive advantage (Boon et al., 2018). Digitalization and technological developments such as ChatGPT can have disruptive effects and even cause a Schumpeter shock comparable to the development of digital photography in contrast to mainstream photo film rolls in the 90s. Disruptive technological developments and Schumpeter shocks are described in Barney's (1991) classic RBV article as phenomena that break through sustained competitive advantage positions of organizations. To what extent is ChatGPT a disruptive technology? And what is the impact of ChatGPT on strategic human resource management (SHRM) and HRM professionals? The application of ChatGPT in the SHRM domain can be found in, for example, writing policy documents on long term absence due to illness, recruitment and selection, onboarding processes, screening of job applicants and job applications, and constructing job descriptions (Renkema, 2023; Renkema et al., 2022). One of the interesting issues raised by Renkema (2023) refers to the question posed by Susskind and Susskind (2022): How is new HRM knowledge developed if HRM professionals are no longer necessary and replaced by technology? Replacement, substitution, value, imitation, and scarcity in HRM almost automatically make us think about SHRM and the resource-based view. Chaudhary (2023) summarizes a few areas where ChatGPT can improve HR processes including improved cost-effective solutions; easier HR data management and analytics; enhanced employee experience based on survey input; and simplified recruiting and onboarding. In this overview we focus on the possible negative and positive effects of ChatGPT using the classic RBV (Paauwe & Boselie, 2003) and an alternative theoretical framework we call: Open resource-based view to SHRM1. The overall aim is to provide a research agenda for studying SHRM and HRM professional implications from a uniqueness perspective.\n\n# 2.2.2 Resource based view: The negative perspective\n\nReflecting on the past 30 years of research, the resource-based view is one of the most dominant theories in SHRM (Paauwe, 2004). Looking at the implications of widely applied ChatGPT soon, we foresee a severe reduction of the possibilities to achieve a sustained competitive advantage through SHRM. After all, considering the four conditions, as formulated by Barney (1991) they will lose their relevance:\n\n- Value: ChatGPT is freely available for everyone, so there is no or limited possibility to generate and reap the rents as proprietary rights are lacking. The rents and the benefits are there for everybody, who knows how to handle and apply the software.\n- Scarcity: Not anymore. This is not only the case for ChatGPT, but increasingly for all kinds of open-source software.\n- Imitation: This used to be the core of the RBV theory and especially for achieving a ‘competitive advantage through people’ (Pfeffer, 1994), and clarified by the conditions of ‘causal ambiguity’, ‘path dependency’ and ‘social\n\n# 2.2.3 | Open resource-based view:\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a generative AI system that can be applied in various domains, including strategic human resource management, to improve processes such as recruitment, onboarding, and policy document writing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAAP PAAUWE<|>PERSON<|>Jaap Paauwe is a researcher focused on strategic human resource management and the implications of technology like ChatGPT on HRM practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL BOSELIE<|>PERSON<|>Paul Boselie is a researcher who collaborates with Jaap Paauwe on the implications of technology in strategic human resource management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Resource Management (HRM) is a strategic approach to managing people in organizations, focusing on policies and systems that influence employee performance and satisfaction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE-BASED VIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Resource-Based View (RBV) is a management theory that suggests that the resources and capabilities of an organization are key to achieving competitive advantage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Disruptive technology refers to innovations that significantly alter the way industries operate, often displacing established technologies and business models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHUMPETER SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A Schumpeter shock is a term used to describe a significant economic disruption caused by innovation, named after economist Joseph Schumpeter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems, and is increasingly integrated into business practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAAP PAAUWE<|>CHATGPT<|>Jaap Paauwe is researching the implications of ChatGPT on strategic human resource management practices.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL BOSELIE<|>CHATGPT<|>Paul Boselie collaborates with Jaap Paauwe on research regarding the impact of ChatGPT on HRM.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<|>ChatGPT is being applied within HRM to enhance processes such as recruitment and onboarding.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>RESOURCE-BASED VIEW<|>ChatGPT challenges traditional Resource-Based View concepts by providing widely available tools that diminish competitive advantage.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY<|>CHATGPT<|>ChatGPT is considered a disruptive technology that can significantly impact HRM practices and business models.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHUMPETER SHOCK<|>DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY<|>Disruptive technology can lead to Schumpeter shocks, causing significant changes in market dynamics and business practices.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI<|>CHATGPT<|>ChatGPT is a form of AI that is being integrated into various business processes, including HRM.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
