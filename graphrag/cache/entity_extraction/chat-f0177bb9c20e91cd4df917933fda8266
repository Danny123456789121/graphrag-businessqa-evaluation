(2003) argue that only studies meeting the specified inclusion criteria should be part of the sample. The authors underscore the importance of documenting the numbers of included and excluded studies at each step of the review, providing reasons for the exclusions. At this stage, the software EndNote was used to eliminate duplicates, and read titles and summaries of articles. After completing all the steps, the final sample consisted of 88 papers, which are presented in Appendix 1.\n\nFor the data extraction stage, Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that researchers should consider the information that will be required to design summary tables and to perform data synthesis. Forms may include details on the source of information (title, authors, journals, and publication details) and any other features that could be relevant to the study. In this research, a spreadsheet was created in MS Excel, fed with information such as title, authors, year, journal, number of citations, objectives, theories, methods, gaps, research opportunities and types of OCs. It was important for assisting the analysis of the studies.\n\nThus, articles were analyzed by content analysis, which is a highly flexible research method widely used as a systematic and rigorous approach to analyze data obtained or generated during the study (White and Marsh, 2006). According to the authors, content analysis may have qualitative and quantitative applications, or both, as is the case of this paper.\n\n# Step 3 - Reporting and dissemination\n\nAn appropriate SLR should make it easier to understand the research by synthesizing works (Tranfield et al., 2003). Based on quantitative and descriptive analysis, we sought to obtain an overview of the articles. Thus, we analyzed the evolution in the number of articles over the years, research methods, sustainability pillars, geographical/sectoral arrangements, industrial sectors, countries where empirical studies were developed and journals with the highest number of publications. Finally, we performed a cluster analysis on the keywords of the sample articles using VosViewer software.\n\nIn the qualitative dimension, an inductive analysis was performed. It is recommended when there are no previous studies investigating the phenomenon or when knowledge is fragmented (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). Thus, this analysis was appropriate for this research since we identified no studies seeking to identify and synthesize types of OCS.\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\nThus, we sought to identify the different OCs and their relationship to sustainability. There was an extensive number of OCSs in the articles. We also realized that, although authors used different terms, some of such capabilities shared the same definition or were strongly related (see Table 2. General overview of OCSs categories, in Section 4.1). Therefore, it was possible to group them into categories. According to Cavanagh (1997), the creation of categories aims to provide a means of describing the phenomenon, increasing understanding and generation of knowledge.\n\nTo formulate categories through analysis of inductive content, it is necessary that the researchers interpret and decide which information should be grouped in the same category (Dey, 1993). The objective is to reduce the number of categories by grouping similar ones, or group different categories into broader categories (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). In this paper, the OCs that comprise each category do not necessarily have the same meaning but are interrelated since their definitions complement each other.\n\nAs warned by Dey (1993), the development of such categories did not occur simply by gathering similar or related information. The OCSs were deeply analyzed as belonging or not to a given category by comparing them with other OCSs that belong or not to that category. Thus, it was possible to define where each OCS was best fitted and which category needed to be formed since no OCS could be placed in a category into which it did not fit. Thus, the OCS identified during the review process were grouped into categories since they have related concepts and definitions (regarding strategic capabilities for sustainability - see Table 2). The related terms adopted by the authors' sample are described in Column 3 of Table 2, allowing an understanding of the inclusion relationship with the category in which each OCS was found.\n\nSince the OCS categories were identified, a similar procedure was performed to identify the expected sustainability benefits related to such capabilities. In this way, we verified that the studies related to OCS sought to investigate, in a general way, whether their development led companies to obtain benefits related to corporate sustainability.\n\nThe identification procedure was similar to that used for OCS, that is, some benefits were similar or related. Thus, such benefits have also been grouped into\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
