The company trains a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data, including data from its own ecosystem and the subject-matter experts’ knowledge (captured in the Knowledge Base 4.0). The model learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data, which can be used to generate new process models. By using ProcessGPT, the bank is able to streamline its process maintenance tasks and reduce the time and effort required to update process models. This enables the analysts to focus on more strategic tasks and ensures that the company’s data ecosystem remains optimized for its operations.\n\n# IV. PROCESS GPT FOR AUTOMATING EXAM MARKING: AN AUTOMATION SCENARIO\n\nIn the education sector, evaluating student performance and providing formative feedback is critical for improving students’ learning and achievements. However, grading exams and assignments can be time-consuming, particularly in large-scale online learning environments. One potential solution to reduce instructors’ workload is the use of ProcessGPT to automate exam marking. In our recent work [19], we leveraged generative AI to automate assessment marking in the education domain. The benefits of automating exam marking using ProcessGPT are manifold. Firstly, it can save time and resources for educators, allowing them to focus on other critical tasks such as analyzing student performance data and developing personalized learning plans. Secondly, it can eliminate human bias and ensure that all students are graded fairly and accurately. Thirdly, it can provide immediate feedback to students, allowing them to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance in future exams.\n\nWith the growing use of technology in education, automating exam marking using ProcessGPT is a logical step towards enhancing the learning process. Moreover, the use of ProcessGPT for exam marking has the potential to significantly improve the quality and reliability of assessments in the education sector. By training ProcessGPT algorithms on a large dataset of previously graded exams, the system can learn how to identify and evaluate specific patterns in the answers, learn from instructors’ experience, and accurately and consistently grade exams with much faster turnaround times than human graders. Moreover, the use of ProcessGPT for exam marking can also detect plagiarism. By analyzing and comparing the answers provided by students in the same exam and previous exams, ProcessGPT algorithms can identify similarities that may indicate plagiarism. This is especially useful for large classes where it may be difficult for human graders to detect such cases. Furthermore, ProcessGPT can\n\n735\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek. Downloaded on October 25,2023 at 12:57:13 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\n# also detect subtle differences in writing styles, making it more difﬁcult for students to evade detection. This will ensure academic integrity and discourage cheating, providing a fairer and more transparent evaluation of student performance.\n\n# V. PROCESS GPT FOR WORKFLOWS: A HYBRID SCENARIO FOR BLENDING AUTOMATION AND AUGMENTATION\n\nIn the age of generative AI, the landscape of workﬂows is undergoing a signiﬁcant transformation. The emergence of advanced AI models, such as ProcessGPT, can revolutionise how we perceive, design, and utilize workﬂows. ProcessGPT paves the way for a transformative approach that seamlessly integrates automation and augmentation, redeﬁning the workﬂows of the future. This in turn has the potential to revolutionize how tasks are accomplished, offering a hybrid model that combines the efﬁciency of automation with the expertise of human knowledge workers. Let us explore a motivating scenario in a police investigation where ProcessGPT showcases its capabilities in supporting a hybrid mode. Law enforcement agencies operate within a complex web of processes, from evidence collection and suspect identiﬁcation to case management and legal proceedings. ProcessGPT has the potential to offer a transformative approach to these workﬂows, enabling automation and, at the same time, acting as a knowledgeable copilot for law enforcement professionals.\n\n# Automation\n\nLaw enforcement workﬂows encompass several crucial stages: data aggregation, evidence gathering, data analysis, suspect proﬁling, and decision-making. In the initial stages, investigators spend signiﬁcant time sifting through vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as crime databases, surveillance footage, and witness statements. ProcessGPT can automate this data aggregation, rapidly organizing and contextualizing the information, saving investigators valuable time and effort. For example, by automating the data aggregation process, ProcessGPT signiﬁcantly reduces the time and effort required for investigators to compile evidence. Investigators can focus on analyzing the extracted information and connecting the dots, rather than spending hours locating and gathering data. This automation expedites the investigation process and enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evidence collection. Furthermore, ProcessGPT’s ability to contextualize the gathered information adds value to workﬂow automation. It can analyze the relationships between different pieces of evidence, identify patterns, and highlight potential leads for further investigation.\n\n# Augmentation\n\nBy leveraging its comprehensive knowledge base and reasoning abilities, ProcessGPT can generate insightful questions and alternative investigative strategies and provide contextual guidance to investigators. This augmentation aspect helps investigators uncover hidden connections, identify patterns, and consider perspectives that might have been overlooked, enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Additionally, ProcessGPT’s ability to learn from successful investigation patterns, legal precedents, and evolving crime trends empowers it to improve its analytical skills continuously. This evolution ensures that ProcessGPT remains a reliable resource, guiding investigators through complex cases by suggesting relevant leads, recommending potential courses of action, and keeping them updated with the latest developments in the ﬁeld.\n\n# VI.
