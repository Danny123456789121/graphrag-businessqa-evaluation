Sensitivity analysis of supplier evaluation across Eco, Env and Soc aspects (supplier evaluation = False = 70.7%).\n\nWhat-if scenario analyses (predictive analyses) are also conducted to evaluate the inferences of the model based on decision-maker knowledge. Such analyses can be performed by entering a number of observations into the BN to update the marginal probabilities of any unobserved variables. The objective is to examine how the posterior probabilities of the supplier selection criteria change when different evidence is entered into the model. For instance, we tested the impact of unknown information of some criteria on the decision for selecting a supplier. In scenario 1, we assumed information that there was a very high level for “health and safety (Soc2)” in the social dimension, very high level for “quality of product (Eco2)” in the economic dimension and with no information in the environmental dimension.\n\nWe can see that by increasing the health and safety (Soc2) result, considerable improvement is seen in social criteria employment practices (Soc1) from 20% to 82% (very high) and responsibility to stakeholders and community (Soc3) from 20% to 90% (very high). Considerable improvement is seen also in cost (Eco1) from 8.2% to 30% (very high) as a result of increasing product quality (Eco2) from 20% to 100% as shown in Figure 6. The overall decision for selecting this supplier is now 55.69% true; previously, this result in the base case was 29.3% true.\n\n|Supplier selection|False|True|\n|---|---|---|\n|Soc|44.306%|55.694%|\n|Env|Very Low|20.292%|\n|Low|11.4045|Medium|\n|Medium|19.262%|20.003%|\n|High|20.292%|32.906%|\n|Very High|79.911%|126.4363|\n\nFigure 6. Scenario 1: with very high health and safety (Soc2) and quality of product (Eco2).\n\nIn scenario 2, as shown in Figure 7, we include the new environmental performance of the supplier. Assume that a high level of performance for (Env1) occurred, meaning that the supplier produced a very...\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\nsmall quantity of total emitted CO2, possibly through improved supply and transport activities. Based on this information, our model predicts a high level in the environmental dimension. The decision about selecting this supplier now increases to approximately 71% true.\n\n# Supplier selection\n\n|False|28.911%|\n|---|---|\n|True|71.089%|\n\n|Soc|Env|Eco|\n|---|---|---|\n|Very Low|Very Low|Very Low|\n|Low|Low|Low|\n|Medium|Medium|Medium|\n|High|Very High|High|\n|Very High|High|Very High|\n\nFigure 7. Scenario 2: very high health and safety (Soc2) and quality of product (Eco2) and high reduction in pollution (Env1).\n\nIn scenario 3, presented in Figure 8, we have information only about the quality of service (Eco3) as a low level in the economic aspect and a high level of resource consumption (Env2) in the environmental aspect, and no social criteria information is provided. Based on this information, the probability of the economic performance being low is 41.049%. Thus, the decision about selecting this supplier is 82.245% false due to the very high importance of the economic dimension.\n\n# Supplier selection\n\n|False|82.245%|\n|---|---|\n|True|17.755%|\n\n|Soc|Env|Eco|\n|---|---|---|\n|Very Low|Very Low|41.049%|\n|Low|\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
