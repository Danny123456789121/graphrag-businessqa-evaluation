The results shown in Table 4 indicate that a positive correlation between CSP and CFP is more likely when the accounting-based measures of CFP or when simple methods are used. This section investigates the significance and magnitude of individual moderators found in Table 4 using a subsample related to measurement and methodology issues. Procedures used in Table 3 and 4 were repeated to explore the moderating effect of individual accounting-based measures versus market-based measures and the moderating effect of simple versus complex methodologies used in the prior research. Table 5 shows the results of the moderator analysis and Table 6 presents the breakdown univariate results of these moderator effects using subsamples.\n\nResults in Table 5 and Table 6 reveal that compared to the return on assets (ROA) measure, other accounting measures such as return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), and earnings per share (EPS) or sales growth appear to have a stronger impact on the CSP-CFP relationship (significant at 1 percent level). In contrast, for market-based measures, share price and market return appear to have a stronger impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than Tobin’s Q measure (significant at 5 percent level). Table 5 also reveals that the methodology employed in the previous studies is significant in the CSP-CFP relationship.\n\n# Journal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Lu and Taylor\n\n# TABLE 5\n\n# Moderator Results for Subsamples\n\n|Factor|Z-value|\n|---|---|\n|Accounting-based measures (163 observations)| |\n|ROA (return on assets)|26.4998*|\n|ROE (return on equity)|59.2132*|\n|ROS (return on sales)|25.9046*|\n|EPS (earnings per share) or sales growth|35.7430*|\n|Market-based measures (35 observations)| |\n|Share price|15.3616*|\n|Tobin’s Q|17.7765*|\n|Market return|23.3354*|\n|Method of analysis (177 observations)| |\n|Correlation coefﬁcient|68.5181*|\n|Regression|48.4871*|\n|Survey|6.0550*|\n\n* p &lt; 0.01.\n\nThe correlations reported above are weighted by sample size.\n\n# TABLE 6\n\n# Univariate Analysis (Subsample)\n\n|Sample Size|Number of Observations|Mean Effect Size|Mean Study Variance| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |Accounting-based measures (163 observations)| | | |\n|ROA|48|4,537|0.1836|0.0339|\n|Non-ROA**|115|12,364|0.1963|0.0358|\n|ROE*|36|2,456|0.3441|0.0290|\n|Non-ROE|127|14,445|0.1676|0.0370|\n|ROS*|35|7,467|0.1252|0.0204|\n|Non-ROS|128|9,434|0.2479|0.0393|\n|EPS or sales growth*|17|1,511|0.2799|0.0250|\n|Non-EPS or sales growth|146|15,390|0.1844|0.0364|\n| |Market-based measures (35 observations)| | | |\n|Share price*|4|411|0.3260|0.0192|\n|Non-share price|31|14,202|0.1471|0.0126|\n|Market return*|11|979|0.2593|0.0191|\n|Non-market return|24|13,634|0.1445|0.0107|\n|Tobin’s Q|7|4,564|0.1106|0.0015|\n|Non-Tobin’s Q*|28|10,049|0.1708|0.0163|\n| |Method of analysis (177 observations)| | | |\n|Correlation coefﬁcient*|79|3,438|0.3224|0.0622|\n|Non-correlation coefﬁcient|98|17,847|0.1614|0.0117|\n|Regression|95|17,634|0.1608|0.0113|\n|Non-regression*|82|3,651|0.3157|0.0608|\n|Survey|2|190|0.2081|0.0109|\n|Non-survey|175|21,095|0.1861|0.0345|\n\n*, ** p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05 respectively.\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?\n\n# V.
