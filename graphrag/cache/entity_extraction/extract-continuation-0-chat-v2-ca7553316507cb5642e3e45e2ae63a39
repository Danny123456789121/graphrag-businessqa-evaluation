All rights reserved.\n\nProposals are an effective means of increasing female board representation, after controlling for the effects of other potential determinants of increased representation.\n\nThe results are presented in Table 7. To control for outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables at 1 percent and 99 percent. We present five model specifications. In Model 1, we include all the control variables and report a significantly positive coefficient on Target (α = 0.02, p = 0.05), consistent with H3a. Only two control variables, Board Size (β = 0.01, p = 0.01) and existing levels of Female Representation (-0.34, p = 0.01), are significant determinants of increased representation. These findings are consistent in Model 2, where we drop Firm Size and Profitability control variables due to concerns about collinearity. (When we drop these variables, the highest condition index drops from 34 to 21.) These results confirm the findings in Table 6 that demonstrate the effectiveness of shareholder activism in increasing female representation.\n\nWe perform additional tests in Models 3 – 5. In Model 3, we add indicator variables for the time period following SOX (Post Sox), 2002-2008, when requirements for board independence increased; and following Regulation S-K (Post Disclose), 2009-2011, when enhanced proxy statement disclosures requirements, including those pertaining to board diversity, were introduced. In contrast to the descriptive evidence reported in Table 2 of increased shareholder support over time, we find no evidence of higher firm responsiveness over time. In particular, we do not see increased responsiveness leading up to or following the enhanced disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. In Model 4, we add an interaction term Target*Social Proponent to test whether activist type affects the effectiveness of the proposal in increasing female board representation, as prior research has shown that social activism tends to be less effective than financial activism (Goranova & Ryan, 2014). In this model, the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, and the coefficient on Target remains significantly positive. It thus appears that socially-motivated and financially-\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nmotivated activists are equally effective in improving gender diversity, contrary to Hypothesis H3b.\n\nIn the foregoing analysis, we included shareholder proposals both that went to vote and those that did not, in accordance with Ferri (2012), who recommends consideration of both outcomes in activism research. He argues that excluding withdrawn proposals from the analyses potentially understates the success of activism efforts. In Model 5 we add an interaction term Target*Vote, to determine whether the proposal outcome (vote versus withdrawn) affects proposal effectiveness. Vote is defined as an indicator variable equal to one if the proposal went to vote, and zero otherwise. Here the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, and the coefficient on Target remains positive.\n\nFor these additional analyses in Model 3 to 5, we acknowledge that low statistical power may contribute to our lack of results due to the relatively small sample size. However, the consistent results for our main variable of interest, Target, gives us confidence that shareholder proposals are indeed an effective means of increasing gender diversity on corporate boards, despite the fact that none of the proposals in our sample received a majority vote.\n\n# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn this study, we examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Prior research on the antecedents and outcomes of shareholder activism has not specifically addressed the issue of board gender diversity, despite its growing importance internationally. Goranova and Ryan’s (2014) recent review of the shareholder activism literature reveals that while there are numerous prior studies that examine the antecedents of corporate governance shareholder proposals at a\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nAt a broad level, there is not a single paper that focuses directly on gender diversity issues. Similarly, activist researchers have explored outcomes as varied as market reactions to shareholder proposals, firm operating performance, CEO turnover, managerial entrenchment, executive pay, and corporate social performance, yet no extant study, to our knowledge, has examined board gender diversity as an outcome of shareholder activism. We contribute to the activism literature by filling this void.\n\nWe find that the existing levels of female board representation and board independence are significant antecedents of activism and that female board representation is a stronger antecedent for financially-motivated activists than for socially-motivated activists. In addition, our evidence shows that shareholder proposals are effective in increasing board gender diversity – the female board representation of targeted firms increases significantly more in the two-year period following initiation of the proposal related to a sample of matched, non-targeted firms. This finding holds in univariate tests, as well as in a multivariate regression that controls for the level of female board representation prior to the target year and other potential determinants of female representation. We also find that both financially- and socially-motivated activism are equally effective in improving board gender diversity. These latter results contrast with findings in the prior literature that report that activism related to social issues such as gender diversity generally tend to be unsuccessful. They further challenge the seemingly accepted notion that financial activists tend to be more effective in achieving their goals than social activists.\n\nWhile these findings extend the academic literature on shareholder activism, they also have potential implications for managers, activists, and policy-makers. For managers, the knowledge that low female board representation attracts activists and that both financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists are\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>EVENT<|>Shareholder activism refers to the efforts of shareholders to influence a corporation's behavior by exercising their rights as owners, particularly in relation to increasing gender diversity on corporate boards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>EVENT<|>Gender diversity in corporate boards refers to the representation of women on boards of directors, which is increasingly recognized as important for corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>EVENT<|>Female board representation is the presence of women on corporate boards, which is a focus of shareholder activism aimed at improving gender diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIALLY-MOTIVATED ACTIVISTS<|>PERSON<|>Financially-motivated activists are shareholders who advocate for changes in corporate governance primarily for financial gain, including increasing gender diversity on boards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIALLY-MOTIVATED ACTIVISTS<|>PERSON<|>Socially-motivated activists are shareholders who advocate for changes in corporate governance based on social issues, such as gender diversity, rather than financial returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE BOARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate boards are groups of individuals elected to represent shareholders and oversee the activities of a company, with a growing emphasis on gender diversity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>GENDER DIVERSITY<|>Shareholder activism aims to increase gender diversity on corporate boards through proposals and influence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM<|>Shareholder activism is effective in increasing female board representation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIALLY-MOTIVATED ACTIVISTS<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>Financially-motivated activists focus on increasing female board representation for financial benefits<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIALLY-MOTIVATED ACTIVISTS<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>Socially-motivated activists advocate for female board representation based on social justice rather than financial returns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE BOARDS<|>FEMALE BOARD REPRESENTATION<|>The representation of women on corporate boards is a key aspect of corporate governance<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
