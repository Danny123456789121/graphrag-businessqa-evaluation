As the use of GAI grows along with the Metaverse, it is explored by academics, researchers, and industry communities for its endless possibilities. From ChatGPT by OpenAI to Bard AI by Google, GAI is a leading technology in physical and virtual business platforms. This paper focuses on GAI’s economic and societal impact and the challenges it poses. Businesses must rethink their operations and strategies to create hybrid physical and virtual experiences using GAI. This study proposes a framework that can help business managers develop effective strategies to enhance their operations. It analyzes the initial applications of GAI in multiple sectors to promote the development of future customer solutions and explores how GAI can help businesses create new value propositions and experiences for their customers, and the possibilities of digital communication and information technology. A research agenda is proposed for developing GAI for business management to enhance organizational efficiency. The results highlight a healthy conversation on the potential of GAI in various business sectors to improve customer experience.\n\n# Citation\n\nMondal, S.; Das, S.; Vrana, V.G. How to Bell the Cat?

Introduction\n\nOver the past few decades, there has been a growing emphasis on technological innovation within organizations leading to increased attention in research [1,2]. Organizations have recognized the potential of technological innovations to enhance their competitive advantage. Numerous studies have demonstrated that firms can leverage technology to improve their performance and drive innovation [3,4]. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of AI in today’s market has been shown to have a significant impact on firms’ innovation strategies, as evidenced by several studies [5]. Economists and industry experts have been attempting to comprehend the effect of GAI on innovation and have urged for further investigation on the subject [6,7]. Scholars, who are focused on utilizing technology in creation, have also started to investigate this issue [8–10]. Studies on the use of GAI by customers in various sectors have primarily focused on identifying the barriers that prevent them from achieving the maximum outcome and how AI can assist them in making decisions and enhancing their operations [11,12].\n\nConceived as a sub-discipline within AI, GAI allows users to create new content, such as text, images, audio, and videos. It has attracted the interest of various tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Apple. OpenAI’s Codex, DALL-E, and ChatGPT are some of the tools used for this process [13]. Every year, a single overarching idea tends to define the major tech trend. For instance, in 2022, XAI and Web3 emerged as buzzwords.\n\nTechnologies 2023, 11, 44\n\nthat caught the tech world’s attention. Although these trends show no signs of slowing down, 2023 is expected to be dominated by GAI. The concept of GAI involves using algorithms to generate new content. ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing articles, poems, and computer programs, is a prominent example of this technology. Its ability to generate high-quality content is both impressive and a little scary [14]. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI—a research organization backed by Microsoft—has garnered significant attention since its unveiling in November 2022. Its debut has led some to believe that AI is becoming more mainstream. With the commercial success of ChatGPT, Google recently launched an experimental service called Bard, which demonstrates how AI could potentially revolutionize search by providing more nuanced responses to users. [15]. The same week, Microsoft also unveiled a new Bing-powered version by ChatGPT, designed to provide users with more accurate and timely search results. Instead of relying on the traditional ladder approach to search results, ChatGPT takes a request, scans for answers, and provides a response that includes citations to the sources.\n\nDespite the increasing importance of the role of GAI in innovation studies, there has been little effort to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing its applications in various sectors. Moreover, the lack of a clear framework for assessing the impact of GAI on the innovation management process has hindered the development of effective strategies [16, 17]. To tackle these issues, a comprehensive theoretical review of the literature on GAI was conducted. The aim of the review is to provide a basis for developing new theoretical models to study GAI in different sectors [18]. Understanding the diverse needs of customers is essential for creating value that resonates with them. This is because their subjective evaluation of wants and needs can significantly influence the design and implementation of strategies to meet those needs. In addition to identifying customers’ requirements, research emphasizes the importance of customer involvement in co-creating value [19].
