The Performance of Carbon Portfolios\n\nThe table presents the performance of carbon portfolios. Dirty is a portfolio of Örms, which during the initial two phases of the EU ETS received annually more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. Medium is a portfolio of Örms, which for the same period received more than zero but less than 1 million free carbon allowances. Clean is a portfolio of Örms, which did not receive any carbon allowances. All portfolios are formed with equal weights. The mean, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of monthly returns are reported in annualized units. CAPM-a is the alpha of a CAPM regression, FF3-a is the alpha of the Fama-French (1993) 3-factor regression, FF4-a is the alpha of the Carhart (1997) 4-factor regression. All alphas are annualized. t-statistics based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors are reported in parentheses. The asterisks *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively.\n\n|Period|Mean|SDev|SR|CAPM-α|FF3-α|FF4-α| | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | |November 2003 to March 2009|0.167|0.235|0.583|0.130|0.149|0.144|\n|0.022|0.236|0.221|0.039|0.107|0.004| | | |\n|0.001|0.224|0.013|0.141|0.019|0.026| | | |\n| | |Dirty-minus-Clean Portfolio|0.168|0.119|1.167|0.168|0.425|0.118|\n| | |November 2003 to December 2012|0.123|0.248|0.415|0.026|0.040|0.033|\n|0.081|0.230|0.265|0.014|0.001|0.016| | | |\n|0.074|0.227|0.022|0.239|0.004|0.010| | | |\n| | |Dirty-minus-Clean Portfolio|0.036|0.128|0.119|0.029|0.842|0.014|\n| | |Phase I: January 2005 to December 2007|0.190|0.078|2.041|0.153|0.732|0.121|\n| | |Phase II: January 2008 to December 2012|0.084|0.152|0.646|0.070|0.082|0.075|\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# Table 4. The Price of Carbon Risk\n\nThis table reports the price of carbon risk based on Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regressions for the average returns of 65 German stocks. Entries are the percent monthly factor risk premiums for the following factors: DMC is the dirty-minus-clean factor; MKT is the excess market return; SMB is the small-minus-big factor; HML is the high-minus-low factor, MOM is the momentum factor; IND is the industry factor; MAX is the maximum daily return factor; ILLIQ is the illiquidity factor; IVOL the idiosyncratic volatility factor; COSKEW the coskewness factor; and, finally, the downside beta and upside beta. t-statistics are in parentheses.\n\n| |November 2003 to March 2009|November 2003 to December 2012|\n|---|---|---|\n|Constant|0(1) 32 (2 47)|0 71 (6 82)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
