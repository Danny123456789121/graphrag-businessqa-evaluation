To capture innovation capacity we used both generic measures, such as the fraction of R&D expenses over sales, as well as more CSR-specific ones, such as the degree of environmental innovativeness.\n\nWe include several control variables in our analysis. We include prior CFP, since research has shown that this variable affects CSR through the mechanism of organizational slack, as well as current CFP through momentum effects (Waddock & Graves, 1997). We control for firm size, as larger firms tend to be more prone to invest in CSR and profit from it because of the economies of scale involved in the acquisition and deployment of CSR-related resources (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). We include firm leverage because prior CSR research has shown that resource availability is an important predictor of firms’ ability to profit from CSR (Brammer & Millington, 2008). Finally, we control for capital intensity, as prior research has suggested that incorporating CSR initiatives can be more difficult and more costly to implement in capital-intensive industries (Surroca et al., 2010). All variable operationalizations are listed in Table 1.\n\nA common problem in meta-analysis is that the measures used in primary studies tend to involve measurement error. In our case, especially the constructs firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, and innovation capacity are often measured through self-report surveys (Boyd, Gove, & Hitt, 2005), which are often not corroborated with archival measurements (Bergh et al., 2016). Following best-practice recommendations (Bergh et al.,\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n2016), we deal with measurement error by applying a conservative 0.80 measurement reliability standard to all hypothesized mediator variables.\n\n# Meta-analytic procedure\n\nWe used Hunter and Schmidt (2004) meta-analysis (HSMA) to compute the meta-analytic mean association between CSR and CFP, standard deviations, percentage of variance due to sampling error, and 95 percent confidence intervals around mean correlations (Whitener, 1990). Since our constructs of interest are usually reported as a continuum, we provide correlations rather than standardized differences (d) (O’Boyle, Pollack, & Rutherford, 2012). HSMA “allows for the correction of statistical artifact and thus provides a relatively accurate estimate of the true average strength and variance of the relationship in the population of interest” (Geyskens, Steenkamp, & Kumar, 2006, p. 526). Compared to Hedges and Olkin meta-analysis (HOMA; Hedges & Olkin, 1985), which only corrects for sampling error, HSMA corrects for a broader array of statistical artifacts, including measurement error, dichotomization, and range restrictions (Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2009), making it a more appropriate choice for estimating mean effect sizes including subjective measures (Kepes, McDaniel, Brannick, & Banks, 2013). The HSMA method involves (1) estimating the population mean correlation and variability, (2) correcting for the statistical artifacts of sampling and measurement error, and (3) evaluating the existence and impact of moderators (Judge, McNatt, & Xu, 2011). We performed sub-group analyses to assess whether c was sensitive to: (a) the source of the CSR data (survey, archival, or third-party evaluations); (b) the stakeholder group targeted by the CSR activities (employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, community, natural environment, or mixed stakeholders); (c) the CFP measures used (accounting- or market-based); and (d) industry (manufacturing, financial services, non-financial services, or mixed industries).\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nWe used both Pearson product-moment correlations (r) and partial correlations (rxy.z) derived from primary studies to compute c and the corresponding confidence interval.\n\nA partial correlation is a standardized measure of the degree of association between two variables (x and y), controlling for the influence of a vector of other factors (z). We obtained the partial correlations from primary studies by converting reported t-statistics using the relevant formulas.iv rxy.z-based HSMAs generate useful additional information because they measure the direct impact of CSR on CFP, holding other factors constant (Doucouliagos & Ulubaşoğlu, 2008). By using rxy.z, we can also compare the mean effect size of the group of primary studies using endogeneity corrections, such as instrumental variables, with that of the group of studies that does not.\n\nWhen multiple measurements for the same relationship were reported, we included all of them. Monte Carlo simulations have shown that procedures using all reported measurements outperform those that represent each study by a single value in areas such as parameter significance testing and parameter estimation accuracy (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001).\n\nTo test whether this nested research design was causing distortions in our results, we conducted a Hierarchical Linear Modeling Meta-Analysis (HiLMMA; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The HiLMMA results indicate that 30 percent of the variance in the effect size distribution resides at the within-study level. After correcting for this component, the mean effect size for the CSR-CFP relationship (i.e., the intercept of the HiLMMA model) is 0.08, which is nearly identical to the uncorrected HSMA mean effect size (0.07; see Table 2). Hence, all effect sizes reported in primary studies can safely be included in our analyses.\n\n# MASEM Procedure\n\nWe used meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM; Bergh et al., 2016; Carney,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to the practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on society, including environmental sustainability and ethical business practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) is a measure of a company's financial health and profitability, often assessed through various financial metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>PERSON<|>Hunter and Schmidt are researchers known for their contributions to meta-analysis methodologies, particularly in the context of estimating mean associations in research studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WADDOCK & GRAVES<|>PERSON<|>Waddock and Graves are researchers who have studied the relationship between corporate social responsibility and corporate financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCWILLIAMS & SIEGEL<|>PERSON<|>McWilliams and Siegel are researchers who have explored the impact of firm size on corporate social responsibility investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAMMER & MILLINGTON<|>PERSON<|>Brammer and Millington are researchers who have examined the predictors of firms' ability to profit from corporate social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURROCA ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Surroca and colleagues have researched the challenges of implementing corporate social responsibility initiatives in capital-intensive industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERGH ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Bergh and colleagues have contributed to the understanding of measurement error in meta-analysis and its implications for research findings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>O'BOYLE, POLLACK, & RUTHERFORD<|>PERSON<|>O'Boyle, Pollack, and Rutherford are researchers who have discussed the importance of providing correlations in meta-analytic studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDGE, MCNATT, & XU<|>PERSON<|>Judge, McNatt, and Xu are researchers who have evaluated the existence and impact of moderators in meta-analytic studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAUDENBUSH & BRYK<|>PERSON<|>Raudenbush and Bryk are known for their work in hierarchical linear modeling, particularly in the context of meta-analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices are believed to influence Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) through various mechanisms, including organizational slack and resource availability.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>CSR<|>Hunter and Schmidt's meta-analytic procedures are used to compute the association between CSR and CFP, correcting for statistical artifacts.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WADDOCK & GRAVES<|>CSR<|>Waddock and Graves' research indicates that prior CFP affects CSR through organizational slack, linking the two concepts.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCWILLIAMS & SIEGEL<|>CSR<|>McWilliams and Siegel's findings suggest that larger firms are more likely to invest in CSR, indicating a relationship between firm size and CSR initiatives.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAMMER & MILLINGTON<|>CSR<|>Brammer and Millington's research shows that resource availability is a predictor of firms' ability to profit from CSR, linking these two entities.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURROCA ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Surroca et al. highlight the challenges of implementing CSR in capital-intensive industries, indicating a relationship between industry type and CSR effectiveness.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERGH ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Bergh et al. discuss measurement error in CSR studies, which can impact the perceived relationship between CSR and CFP.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>O'BOYLE, POLLACK, & RUTHERFORD<|>CSR<|>O'Boyle, Pollack, and Rutherford emphasize the importance of correlations in understanding the relationship between CSR and CFP.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDGE, MCNATT, & XU<|>CSR<|>Judge, McNatt, and Xu's work on moderators in meta-analysis can influence the interpretation of CSR's impact on CFP.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAUDENBUSH & BRYK<|>CSR<|>Raudenbush and Bryk's hierarchical modeling techniques can be applied to analyze the relationship between CSR and CFP more accurately.<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
