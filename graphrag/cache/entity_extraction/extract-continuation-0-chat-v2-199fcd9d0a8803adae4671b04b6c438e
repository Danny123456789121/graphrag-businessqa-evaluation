However, the single-index model can produce distorted results by not controlling factors other than market portfolio. Prior literature indicates that SRI and conventional funds are different in their investment universe and portfolio strategies, having significantly different loadings on size, book-to-market, and momentum factors (Bauer et al., 2005; Renneboog et al., 2008b). In order to take into account the difference between the two types of funds, researchers use multi-factor models (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997; Galema et al., 2008; Edmans, 2011). A spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds may disappear if all relevant factors are incorporated.\n\nCAPM, the Fama-French model, and the four-factor Carhart model are unconditional models since coefficients of factors do not change over time. In practice, however, fund managers change their portfolio holdings according to changes in macroeconomic environments, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles (Renneboog et al., 2008a). In this situation, the unconditional model may be inappropriate, hence Ferson and Schadt (1996) and Christopherson et al. (1998) propose conditional models that allow coefficients of factors to vary over time. Since investors on SRI funds may not be as sensitive as investors on conventional funds to economic environment changes, SRI funds may not adjust their portfolio holdings as quickly as conventional funds (Bollen, 2007; Benson and Humphrey, 2008). If this behavioral difference is ignored in deriving performance measures by employing the unconditional model as a benchmark, SRI performance would become spuriously different from conventional performance. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 10.\n\nThe AESs calculated using more refined return-generating models will be smaller.\n\n# 2.3.3. Matching.\n\nSome authors employ a matching procedure where each SRI fund is mapped with conventional funds of similar characteristics like size, location, composition, and time horizon so as to control confounding factors (Derwall and Koedijk, 2009; Ferruz et al., 2012; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). If proper counterfactuals to SRI portfolios are employed, the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance can be eliminated. Therefore, the AESs will be smaller when matching procedure is employed.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nThe above discussion on methodological issues leads to the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 11.\n\nThe AESs will be smaller when more sophisticated methodologies are employed.\n\n# 3. Methodology\n\n# 3.1. Meta-analysis\n\nSince positive, negative, and no effect views can all be justified theoretically, synthesizing empirical findings to obtain the true overall impact of SRI is very important to both academia and industry. A meta-analysis is a particularly useful tool for this purpose, since it reflects the magnitude of performance differences between SRI and conventional groups by calculating ESs of individual studies and reporting overall ES utilizing information on the precision of individual studies (Combs et al., 2011).\n\nSpecifically, the first step of meta-analysis is to calculate the ES for each experiment or paper using Hedges’ g as follows (Hedges, 1981):\n\ng = PT / r  (1)\n\nwhere PT (PC) is the mean performance of portfolios included in the SRI (conventional) group and r is the pooled within-group standard deviation which can be computed using the following formula:\n\nr = √((NT - 1)VT + (NC - 1)VC) / (NT + NC - 2)  (2)\n\nwhere NT (NC) is the sample size of the SRI (conventional) group and VT (VC) is the variance of the SRI (conventional) group. Intuitively, the ES can be interpreted as a standardized performance difference between the two groups whatever the performance measures are and Table 1 shows the interpretation of ESs. The value of d = 0.01 has a very small effect, while d = 2.0 has a huge effect. Although we can typically compute ESs using the above equations, there are other cases where ESs are computed using different equations. The Appendix provides a detailed explanation on how to achieve ESs in special cases.\n\nOnce we obtain the ESs of each experiment or paper, the next step is to compute the weighted ES by considering all papers in the sample so as to obtain the overall SRI impact on portfolio performance as proposed by Hasselblad and Hedges.\n\nThere are in general multiple analyses in one paper. We use the terms “analysis,” “study,” “experiment” and “comparison” interchangeably.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# C.-S. Kim\n\n# Table 1 Interpretation of effect size\n\nThis table contains interpretations for magnitudes of effect size and their references. Originally Cohen (1988) suggested three groups of ESs, small, medium, and large, and the other three ESs have been appended by Sawilowsky (2009). A similar interpretation can be made in cases of negative effect sizes.\n\n|Effect size|d|References|\n|---|---|---|\n|Very small|0.01|Sawilowsky (2009)|\n|Small|0.20|Cohen (1988)|\n|Medium|0.50|Cohen (1988)|\n|Large|0.80|Cohen (1988)|\n|Very large|1.20|Sawilowsky (2009)|\n|Huge|2.00|Sawilowsky (2009)|\n\n(1995).
