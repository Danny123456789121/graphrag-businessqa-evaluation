RESULTS\n\n# Main Effects\n\nThis section provides the meta-analytic results for the overall sustainability performance effects. Table 2 presents the overall results of the main effects associated with sustainability performance.\n\nWe used MetaWin computer software to perform meta-analysis because MetaWin offers the distinctive features of an effect size calculator, and more conservative results as well as the graphical presentation. According to Hunter and Schmidt (2004), there are several commercial programs available for different types of meta-analysis: D-stat (Johnson 1989), Advance BASIC Meta-Analysis (Mullen 1989), and MetaWin (Rosenberg, Adams, and Gurevitch 1997). The first two programs are limited to fixed-effects meta-analysis models, while MetaWin allows for both fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis models. Bax, Yu, Ikeda, and Moons (2007) studied four commercial meta-analysis programs (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), WEasyMA, MetaWin, and MetAnalysis) and two free programs (RevMan and MIX) and found that MetaWin’s results are slightly more conservative, since the confidence intervals are based on bootstraps.\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?\n\n# TABLE 2\n\n# Main Effect Results for Corporate Sustainability Performance\n\n|Number of Samples (k)|Number of Observations (n)|Mean Correlation (r)|Weighted Mean Correlation (r W)|Mean Study Variance (var )t|95% Confidence Interval (I BS)|Unaccounted Effect Size (v2)|Fail-Safe Sample Size (N fsR)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Corporate Financial Performance|198|31,514|0.1699*|0.1737|0.0313|0.1468|0.2024|\n| | | | |Medium|837.2772*|57,637| |\n\n* p &lt; 0.05.\n\nOur hypothesis predicts there is no relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. The meta-analysis in Table 2 shows that the correlation between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance is 0.1737 (The uncorrected correlation is 0.1699.) As such, the effect is medium-sized (Cohen 1988). This suggests that the level of financial performance is significantly associated with the level of sustainability performance. The 95 percent bootstrapped confidence interval around the mean correlation ranges from 0.1468 to 0.2024, indicating the effect size is significant (because 0 is not in this range). Rosenthal’s (1979) fail-safe N(NfsR = 57,637) suggests that publication bias (the file-drawer problem) is not a problem. An additional 57,637 studies would need to be added to the meta-analysis in order to yield a statistically nonsignificant overall effect. Given the heterogeneity present within the dataset (v2 (198) = 837.2772, p &lt; 0.01), an examination of key moderators to the relationship between sustainability performance and financial performance is warranted. The moderator analysis will be discussed after the main effect results are presented.\n\n# Moderator Results (Full Sample)\n\nIn addition to integrating the results across studies, meta-analytic procedures can help find factors that moderate the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance.
