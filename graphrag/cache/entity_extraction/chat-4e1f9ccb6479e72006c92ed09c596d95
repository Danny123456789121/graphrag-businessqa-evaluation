Climate sensitivity in Republican and Democrat states\n\nIf concerns about regulation drive temperature sensitivity, firms headquartered in states run by Democrats should be more exposed to temperature shocks than firms headquartered in states run by Republicans, given the different climate policies advocated by two parties. We form size-value as well as industry portfolios within Republican and Democrat states, and run time-series regressions to examine if firms in Republican states are less negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in Democrat states. Section “Industry portfolios” present the results for five industry portfolios, those for the size-value portfolios are shown in the section “Size-value portfolios”.
