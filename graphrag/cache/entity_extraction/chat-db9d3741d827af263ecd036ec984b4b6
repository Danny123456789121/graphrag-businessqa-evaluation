Over the period January 2012 to June 2015, only 0.10% (leading finance) and 0.49% (elite business) of articles published engaged with climate change (see Appendix, Table 3).\n\nAmong the elite business journals, we find that finance and marketing have not engaged with climate issues at all (see Table 2). We do find some limited engagement with climate change in elite journals from accounting, economics, management, operations research and ‘other’ business disciplines. Economics has engaged the most with climate topics, with all five elite journals having published at least one climate change-related paper and 0.5% of all publications addressing climate issues. However, it is noteworthy that of the 42 publications in economics, 36 come from one journal (America Economic Review). This highlights the importance of editorial policy in establishing journal norms (we return to this below).\n\nThe 21 leading finance journals have only published 12 climate change-related articles since 1998. Six of those were published since 2012 suggesting only a marginal increase in recent interest. Of the top ten journals, only the Journal of Banking and Finance has published climate-related articles (n = 4). The Journal of Risk and Insurance is the only other journal to have published more than one article (n = 2) (see Table 1). Other than the Journal of Banking and Finance, the journals that have published climate change-related articles tended to be towards the bottom of the ranking list. The three elite finance journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies) did not publish a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period. These findings are consistent with a recent review of ‘what’s hot’ in finance research for the four leading finance journals over the period 2011 to 2015 (see Bhattacharya et al. 2016). In the review, there is no mention of climate, carbon or environmental finance.\n\n# 3.2 Climate finance-related research\n\nAll 12 climate change-related articles in leading finance journals were coded as also being climate finance-related. In addition, 25 of 74 climate change-related articles in elite business journals were similarly coded as being climate finance-related. Figure 1 summarises the coding of these climate finance-related articles. Just under half of the 37 climate finance-related articles addressed carbon markets; an additional 14% (the ‘other’ category) mainly addressed carbon taxes. This leaves an almost complete absence of research on critically important issues of risk, valuation (including stranded assets) and investment opportunities related to climate change.\n\nWe conclude overall that there is a dearth of climate finance-related research in leading finance journals, and that this small number of contributions are disproportionately focused on carbon markets. Elite business journals, in particular in the accounting, economics and operations research disciplines, have addressed climate finance-related topics to a very slightly greater extent (n = 25 vs. n = 12) and while these address a broader set of issues, they also tend to be dominated by research on carbon markets and carbon taxes (see Table 2).\n\nIt is instructive to provide some context for our headline findings that 0.06 and 0.08% of all articles published from 1998 to 2015 in leading finance journals and elite business journals respectively are on climate finance-related research. In other words, what other topics are finance journals covering? Financial intermediation (including banking and related regulatory issues) and market microstructure (the study of how exchange occurs in financial markets) respectively accounted for 8% and 3.7% of articles published in the Journal of Finance between 2011 and 2015 (Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Research on financial intermediation has clearly grown in importance due to the global financial crisis, while market microstructure has become more prominent as electronic and high-frequency trading have expanded across financial markets (see Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015). Both areas are distinct from the ‘core’ focus of finance research on asset pricing, corporate finance and investments, which together accounted for 67% of research in the Journal of Finance over the same period (Bhattacharya et al. 2016).\n\n# 4 Discussion\n\nIt is striking that finance research is so ‘behind the climate curve’ given that investment professionals (Van Renssen 2014) and financial regulators (Batten et al. 2016; FSB 2016) are strongly engaged with climate finance topics. We offer four possible explanations.\n\nFirst, contemporary critiques of finance research suggest the discipline is isolated and increasingly distanced from practice or the reality of financial markets (Focardi and Fabozzi 2012; Keasey and Hudson 2007). For instance, Focardi and Fabozzi (2012, pp. 108–109) observe that ‘[a] true empirical science would revise its models so that they fit empirical data. Financial economics, however, takes the opposite approach and considers deviations from an idealized economic rationality to be anomalies of the true empirical price processes’. Similarly, Keasey and Hudson (2007) observe that finance researchers are reluctant to engage with practice, leading them to conclude that finance theory is ‘a house without windows’. Accordingly, finance researchers seeking to publish in leading finance journals may be unaware of climate finance-related issues worthy of research attention. Among the leading finance journals, the two which are most practitioner-oriented have both published climate change-related articles. These are the Financial Analysts Journal (the Chartered Financial Analysts\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260\n\nInstitute’s journal) and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
