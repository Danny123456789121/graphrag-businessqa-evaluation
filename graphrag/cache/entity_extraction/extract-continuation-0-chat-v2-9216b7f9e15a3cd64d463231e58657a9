For our main analysis we relied on product-moment correlations (r) as bivariate measures. As a kind of robustness test and in order to examine the influence of methodological artifacts, we run a second analysis using partial correlations (rxy.z) (Carney et al., 2011; van Essen et al., in press). We computed the partial correlations from the t statistics and degrees of freedom (Doucouliagos & Ulubasoglu, 2008; Greene, 2007).14 Partial correlations capture the association between the variables of interest (xy), given a set of n control variables (z) used in multiple regression models (Carney et al., 2011). In line with van Essen et al. (in press) and\n\nWe included studies that either used accounting-based measures or market-based measures of CFP. However, several studies used perceptual measures derived from questionnaires. We included these studies when they applied quasi-objective measures (i.e., measures that replicate objective measures) (Richard et al., 2009) referring to the accounting-based or market-based dimension of CFP.\n\nA list of the studies included in the analysis is provided in the appendix.\n\nWe used the following formula: (t²/(t² + df)), where t is the t statistic and df is the degrees of freedom. Because this calculation always produces a positive number, we converted it to a negative number if the regression coefficient was negative (Greene, 2007).\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al. Making sense of conflicting empirical findings: A meta-analytic review of the relationship between corporate environmental and financial performance. European Management Journal (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2013.12.004\n\nJ. Endrikat et al. / European Management Journal xxx (2014) xxx–xxx 9\n\nDoucouliagos & Ulubasogß ˘lu (2008) we used this property to examine the effects of certain control variables typically included in the regression models of the primary studies. As partial correlations measure the relationship of the variables of interest holding other factors (i.e., the applied control variables) constant, we can control for the contribution of these factors to the heterogeneity of the results (Doucouliagos & Ulubasogß ˘lu, 2008). We applied subgroup-analysis for this purpose.\n\nFor the calculation of the summary effects, we applied random-effects models (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). Since the majority of studies did not provide reliability estimates, we corrected the effect sizes for measurement error using a conservative 0.8 reliability estimate (e.g., Dalton, Daily, Certo, & Roengpitya, 2003; Deutsch, 2005; Lee & Madhavan, 2010) as recommended by Dalton and Dalton (2005) and Geyskens et al. (2009). Admittedly, this is an assumed artifact distribution. However, it corresponds with the mean value that Aguinis et al. (2011) calculated across 196 meta-analyses conducted in management research and in related fields. We used inverse variance weights to give more weight to more precise effect sizes. Additionally, we applied Fisher’s Z transformation procedures (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% level. We calculated Q-statistics for testing the homogeneity of the effect size distribution (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). A statistically significant Q indicates the presence of moderation effects (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).\n\nA common issue in meta-analysis refers to the so-called “file drawer problem” or publication bias. Publication bias is present when the magnitude, direction, or significance of a study’s results is likely to affect the probability that a study is published (Begg, 1994; Geyskens et al., 2009; Rosenthal, 1979). This may happen when the decision for submitting or publishing studies is influenced by the presence or absence of statistically significant results (Begg, 1994; Geyskens et al., 2009). To account for a possible publication bias, we applied Rosenthal’s (1979) “file-drawer” method and calculated the fail-safe k. The fail-safe k provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to make the summary effect insigniﬁcant.\n\nFor testing Hypotheses 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d (referring to CEP and subsequent CFP), 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d (referring to CEP and prior CFP), 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d (referring to CEP and concurrent CFP), and 4 (referring to reactive versus proactive approaches), we run bivariate HOMA and differentiated in each case between process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP and between market-based CFP and accounting-based CFP respectively. For testing the potential moderation effects of methodological artifacts, we run partial HOMA.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Management Journal is a scholarly publication that focuses on management research and empirical findings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
