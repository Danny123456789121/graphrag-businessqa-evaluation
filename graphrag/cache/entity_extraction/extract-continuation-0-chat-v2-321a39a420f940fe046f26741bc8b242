On the one hand, the Sobel test confirms that the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly channeled through the four hypothesized pathways (z = 4.51, p < 0.001), with the total indirect effect amounting to 0.01 (p < 0.01). On the other hand, firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity only partially mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP, as the focal effect remains significant (β = 0.06, p < 0.05) upon their inclusion. Specifically, inspection of the path coefficients for the indirect effects suggests that the four hypothesized mediators combined explain 20.0 percent.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

This suggests that there may be alternative causal paths connecting CSR to CFP.\n\n# Additional analyses\n\nWe performed several additional analyses to address a number of problems that commonly affect meta-analyses. The first of these is the ‘file drawer’ problem, or the underrepresentation of studies reporting weak effects due to publication bias. To address it, we crafted r- and rxy.z- based funnel plots of effect and sample sizes (see Figures 4a and 4b). These figures show a symmetrical pattern with nearly half of the samples to the left of the mean effect size and half to the right; thus suggesting the absence of publication bias (Duval, 2005). We also used the triangulation method to detect the possible presence of publication bias in the CSR-CFP relationship (Harrison, Banks, Pollack, O’Boyle, & Short, 2017). This method involves three complementary tests to detect potential differences between the retrieved HSMA mean effect size and a publication bias-adjusted mean effect size estimate: (a) Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill (Duval, 2005), (b) cumulative meta-analysis (CMA), and (c) moderate selection models (Harrison et al., 2017). The results of these tests suggest the absence of publication bias in our meta-analysis.\n\nA second common problem is undetected measurement error in the underlying primary studies. We already applied a 0.80 level of reliability to all our mediating variables in the main results (see Tables 3 and 4). As an additional robustness check, we re-ran our models using the 0.80 level of reliability for all constructs (Bergh et al., 2016). The findings of this more conservative analysis are consistent with those presented in Table 4.\n\nA third common problem in meta-analyses of literatures based on archival data is overlapping primary samples. We therefore ran a robustness check in which we deleted effect sizes stemming from similar sources (e.g. Fortune 500 firms) with comparable median.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nsampling years. This resulted in the removal of 39 r-based studies and 16 rxy.z-based studies. Our results were not materially affected by the removal of these overlapping samples.\n\nself-report studies tend to report larger effect sizes, possibly due to social desirability and self-aggrandizing biases. We therefore ran a separate MASEM analysis on effects derived from studies reporting objective data. Our results were identical to those of the original analysis.\n\nA fourth issue hampering meta-analyses that also partially include survey data is that they tend to be based largely on cross-sectional studies lacking appropriately lagged variables, which might violate the implicit assumption of temporal sequentiality underlying path analysis. In our sample, 40 percent of all studies are in fact based on longitudinal designs. As an additional robustness check, we therefore re-ran our hypothesized model on the subset of effect sizes derived from this set of studies. The results rejected the mediation effect of firm reputation (Hypothesis 1), possibly due to statistical power attrition, but confirmed Hypothesis 2, 3 and 4.\n\nA sixth issue, again specific to MASEM studies, is that the theorized model may not be the model that empirically fits the data best. To account for this possibility, we tested two alternatively specified models (cf. Bergh et al., 2016). In a first alternative model, we related (a) CSR to reputation enhancement and stakeholder reciprocation; (b) reputation enhancement to CFP; and (c) stakeholder reciprocation to CFP via firm risk and innovation capacity. In a second alternative model, we related (a) CSR to firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity; (b) firm reputation to firm risk and innovation capacity; and (c) stakeholder reciprocation to firm risk and innovation capacity, and (d) firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity to CFP.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nWe found the theorized model to show better performance on 10 out of 14 commonly used model fit indicators.\n\nOccasionally affect the reliability and validity of meta-analytic findings. The results of all robustness tests are available in an online appendix. In sum, we conclude that our results are largely robust against a number of issues that.\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nAfter reviewing almost half a century of empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship, we have developed hypotheses on the causally most relevant empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to positively affect CFP.
