The critical value for acceptance rejection of the null hypothesis for df = 26, and a Type I error rate of .05 is 38.9. This means that the null hypothesis of the data being homogeneous is retained, indicating that the event studies do indeed share a common population effect size. Homogeneity allows this meta-analysis to proceed to a test for significance and to an estimate of effect size. Homogeneity tests on the other samples - the sample of studies that reported AARs, the sample of studies that reported only CAARs, the sample of studies that based significance on t distributions, the sample of studies that used z distributions or used z distributions but had large samples, the sample of illegal actions, and the sample of irresponsible actions - also produced test statistics indicating homogeneity (see Table 4).\n\n# Test for Significance\n\nFor the full sample of 27 event studies, the value of the test statistic for the significance test; (TS)z = -4.648 (p < .0001), makes it clear that the null hypothesis that the population effect size is zero can be rejected (at p < .05). The significance tests on the other six samples, as reported in Table 4, also permit us to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n# Estimate of Effect Size\n\nThe full sample of 27 event studies shows an effect size estimate of D = -0.932, or approximately one full (negative) standard deviation difference between the distributions of the normal and abnormal returns. So, on average, abnormal returns were a full standard deviation below expected normal (i.e., zero) returns. Or, in other words, one could think of the AARs and CAARs as typically having a distribution centered around zero, but on and around the event day one could think of the distribution of those AARs and CAARs as having a distribution shifted a full standard deviation to the left of zero - that is, indicating significantly negative abnormal returns. In a sense, then, socially irresponsible and illicit behavior decreases abnormal returns by a full standard deviation. The 95% confidence interval for the effect size is given by the following formula (Hedges and Olkin; 1985: 8):\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\n=(Zonz Xod) < D<d+ (Zon Oa), where Zon is the two-tailed critical value of the standard normal distribution. In this meta-analysis, then; the confidence interval of the effect size estimator is _. 93 _ (1.96)(.20) < D< -.93 + (1.96)(.20), which simplifies to -1.32<D< -.54.
