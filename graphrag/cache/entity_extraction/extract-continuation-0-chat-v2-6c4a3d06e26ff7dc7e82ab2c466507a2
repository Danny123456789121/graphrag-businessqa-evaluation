More specifically, when it comes to using generative AI for creative tasks, it is important for information systems and HRM research to go beyond the scope of conceptualizing technology governance as a set of practices to optimize the use of technology toward organizational goals, but also to encompass how technology utilization influences the well-being of employees within the workplace. 136 Hence, there is a need to understand how the use of generative AI in organizational settings influences both the cognitive and psychological states of employees, as well as how it defines their interactions and modes of collaboration. Delving into this topic is likely going to be very challenging as it will require an understanding of the employees’ emotional and cognitive states over time while integrating aspects of team performance and collaboration. Before, technology has been primarily examined as the platform to which collaboration\n\n# Generative AI in manufacturing\n\n# Overview\n\nThe fourth industrial revolution envisions the adoption of digitalization, automation, and connectivity technologies in the manufacturing industry that will empower manufacturers to improve their production processes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. Generative AI is an example of such technology that has created a lot of excitement in the manufacturing industry. While the principles are not entirely new, its ability to produce human readable output based on text input offers enormous potential for manufacturers. As a whole, generative AI can be utilized to explore and execute optimal solutions, create novel outputs according to functional specifications, costs, and achieve efficient lead time through the combinations of design and production options.\n\n# Algorithmic creative control\n\nAnother key issue that is likely to concern future research is the role of generative AI as the dominant creative force in several industries. While the outputs from such platforms may be seen as a means of enhancing productivity and creativity for many professions, the flip side is that maybe they will gradually replace or take over control of the creative processes. The draw toward AI-generated outcomes may render human creativity irrelevant in the workplace. With that said, very little is known about the long-term effects of moving in this direction as well as how individuals in the creative professions may feel about the creative element of their work being dictated by opaque algorithms. In this regard, it is important to understand how the deployment of generative AI would be done so that employees do not feel controlled in their creative tasks. Moreover, it is important to understand optimal ways of working with generative AI so that an effective augmentation of the creative processes can take place.\n\n# Opportunities\n\nA common issue in the manufacturing industry is the shortage of talents with highly technical, manual, and operational skills, knowledge, and expertise. Some of the attributable reasons for the skills gap include an aging and reduced workforce as well as changing skill sets due to new technology. According to Deloitte, the coming years will see a need for the “ability to program machines on the plant floor.” Although daunting, generative AI offers a promise to bridge this gap through careful investments and a new generation of workforce building. For example, generative AI can be used to train workers on new skills and technologies by offering personalized learning for a more effective learning experience.\n\n# Collaboration in the age of generative AI\n\nOne of the fundamental changes of generative AI concerns the changes in the creative process. Typically, high-skilled professionals in creative industries have certain modes of operating and collaborating in which digital tools are utilized to complement this process. The generative AI platforms that have been seen to date mostly rely on individual input and interaction in creating outcomes. Thus, the question that arises is in which way will future generative AI platforms be designed to cater to the needs of specific professionals. While there is an increasing number of generative AI tools emerging with specialized use for more niche groups, the emphasis to date has been on optimizing the end result and not accommodating the means of collaboration. As such, it will be interesting to investigate how the design of the interfaces for generative AI can accommodate or redefine certain ways of collaboration among professionals. As of now, very little is known as to how collaborative work should define requirements for generative AI tools. However, it is likely that generative AI and its affordances will radically reshape the ways in which professionals work together.\n\nGenerative AI can help manufacturers “look ahead” and anticipate disruptions through simulations and predictions of impacts. Generative AI can be employed to perform an analysis of various data sources for real-time defects identification which would reduce the reliance.\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Challenges\n\nCompanies need to ensure they have the necessary computing infrastructure and data storage to support generative AI and ensure interoperability.140 Manufacturing sites often employ a variety of machines, tools, and production systems that may not be compatible. As such, plant engineers are often relied upon to determine how the different technologies best work together. The lack of a common framework means that integrating generative AI with current production systems may require significant upfront investment in terms of technical capability.\n\n# Research agenda\n\nWe call for the development of case studies and empirical studies on the adoption of generative AI in the manufacturing industry. Manufacturers seeking to integrate generative AI would need to understand the types of tasks that can be credibly employed and what are the best practices in order to fully realize the benefits of generative AI. The potential impacts of generative AI on job displacements, security, privacy, and biases as well as environmental impacts require further attention. Thus, research on how to incorporate generative AI in the workplace, training, and reskilling employees for acceptance will be helpful in preparing the workforce. Finally, the ethical use of generative AI raises concerns surrounding privacy, security, accountability, and fairness. Therefore, guiding frameworks and policies are needed to inform and govern its use.\n\n# Generative AI in sustainable IT management\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) industry has a big role to play in reducing the impact of the climate crisis that the world is currently\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative AI is a technology that produces human-readable output based on text input, offering potential improvements in productivity and creativity across various industries, particularly manufacturing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELOITTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deloitte is a consulting firm that provides insights and forecasts regarding workforce needs and skills gaps in various industries, including manufacturing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Journal of Computer Information Systems publishes research and insights on the integration of technology, including generative AI, in various sectors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>DELOITTE<|>Deloitte provides insights on the workforce needs that generative AI aims to address in the manufacturing industry<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS<|>The Journal of Computer Information Systems discusses the implications and research surrounding the use of generative AI in various industries<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
