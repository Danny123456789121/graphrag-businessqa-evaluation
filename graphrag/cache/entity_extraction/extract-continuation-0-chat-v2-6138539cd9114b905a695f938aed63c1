If this is not available, we take the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, weighted by revenues. The synthetic greenness and transparency indicator Gi,y of company i at year y is defined as the weighted average of the two components, as follows:\n\nGi,y = γKi,y + (1 − γ)Ei,y , with γ ∈ [0, 1],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ki,y is the inverse of the ranking of firm i in term of emission intensity, and Ei,y is the ranking of firm i in term of E score. The parameter γ controls for the relative importance of the two components of the index. We set γ = 0.5 as benchmark case, and show results for γ = 0.2 and γ = 0.8 as robustness checks in Section 6. More transparent companies, for a given level of intensity of GHG or CO2 emissions, are associated with larger values of the indicator Gi,y. Firms that attain a lower emission intensity, for a given level of transparency, are also associated with larger values of Gi,y.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of companies in our sample which did some environmental disclosure, from 2005 to 2017 (yellow bar). The figure also reports the number of firms that disclosed their emission intensity in a given year (gray bar). The number of companies reporting on their environmental performance has exhibited an upward trend in the last ten years, reaching around 700 EUROSTOXX companies in 2017, i.e. more than half of the sample.\n\nThe indicators we use to build the synthetic greenness and transparency indicator have some limitations. First, the analysis provided in Section 5 includes data from 2005, while the Bloomberg ESG application was launched only in 2009. This potentially introduces look-ahead bias (see, e.g., Derwall et al., 2005). However, this bias is mitigated by the availability of firms’ environmental disclosures, including on GHG emissions, also prior to 2009. In other words, market participants could start using the Bloomberg E score as such only as of 2009, but the information.\n\nFigures 2 and 3 in the Appendix plot the greenness and transparency indicator, as well as its components, for two representative companies.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n# Figure 1: Total number of companies for which E score (yellow bar) and emission intensity (gray bar) are available.\n\n| |2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |900| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |800| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |700| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |600| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |500| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |400| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |300| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |200| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |100| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |0| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\nThis index is based on was already available to the market. A second issue relates to the self-reported nature of GHG emissions, as well as of other environmental disclosures. As a matter of fact, the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) only requires auditors to verify the publication of non-financial disclosures by relevant firms, but there are no assessment and verification requirements on the content of non-financial disclosures. Based on this, we should emphasize that those firms we identify as greener based on their environmental disclosures may actually be less green than they claim. Still, our asset pricing analysis should not be affected by this problem, insofar as investors base their decisions only on publicly available information as we do. Related to the issue of self-reporting is that of self-selection, due to the fact that unless firms are subject to the NFRD, they are free to choose whether to disclose environmental information. Those that are subject to the NFRD, can choose what to disclose in particular. Typically, self-selection may introduce a bias in the analysis. However, in our case self-selection works in the right direction, as greener firms have an incentive to disclose more and in our framework, firms that are characterized by a lower emission intensity and better environmental disclosures are correctly identified as greener and more transparent. Still, we miss information on those firms that do not disclose. Finally, ESG ratings may differ quite substantially across different data providers, as shown by a growing stream of empirical literature, including, among others, Chatterji et al. (2016), Escrig-Olmedo et al. (2019), and Berg et al. (2019). This latter paper, for example, shows that there is much more disagreement among raters on environmental ratings compared to credit ratings, but still less compared to social and governance ratings. To partly account for the limited reliability of environmental ratings and scores, we use the E score in combination with quantitative data on carbon emissions. We also show Performing the analysis from January 2010 to August 2018 yields empirical results in line with the ones provided\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROSTOXX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EUROSTOXX is a stock market index that includes companies from the Eurozone, used to analyze the performance of European stocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOMBERG ESG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bloomberg ESG is a financial data service that provides environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and scores for companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NFRD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) requires certain companies to disclose non-financial information, including environmental impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions refer to the release of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, which is a significant factor in climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E SCORE<|>EVENT<|>The E score is a rating that reflects a company's environmental performance based on its disclosures and emissions data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Carbon emissions refer specifically to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, a major contributor to climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES<|>EVENT<|>Environmental disclosures are reports made by companies regarding their environmental impact and sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECTION 5<|>EVENT<|>Section 5 refers to a part of the document that discusses the analysis of environmental data and its implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECTION 6<|>EVENT<|>Section 6 refers to a part of the document that discusses robustness checks related to the analysis of environmental data.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOMBERG ESG<|>NFRD<|>The NFRD requires companies to disclose non-financial information, which is utilized by Bloomberg ESG for its ratings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROSTOXX<|>GHG EMISSIONS<|>The performance of EUROSTOXX companies is analyzed in relation to their GHG emissions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHG EMISSIONS<|>E SCORE<|>The E score is influenced by the level of GHG emissions reported by companies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NFRD<|>ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES<|>The NFRD mandates companies to provide environmental disclosures<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E SCORE<|>CARBON EMISSIONS<|>The E score incorporates data on carbon emissions to assess environmental performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECTION 5<|>SECTION 6<|>Section 5 and Section 6 discuss different aspects of the analysis of environmental data<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
