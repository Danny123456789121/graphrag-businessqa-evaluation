The relationship between urbanization and energy use is positive but insignificant, whereas population size, GDP per capita and economic structure positively affect energy use. The elasticity of energy use to population growth is 1.23, while the elasticity to GDP per capita is 0.316. A 1% increase in the share of the industrial and service sector in the economy raises energy use by 0.069% and 0.049%, respectively.\n\nHowever, the results of Models 8, 12 and 16 show that the impact of urbanization on energy use is statistically significant at the 10% level or lower, and differs across the various development stages. Surprisingly, a 1% increase in urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group by 0.132%, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups by 0.507% and 0.907%, respectively. The positive link between urbanization and energy use is evident in several previous studies (Jones, 1991; Parikh and Shukla, 1995; York, 2007).\n\nThe effects of population growth, GDP per capita and economic structure on energy consumption are also heterogeneous across the different income groups. The elasticity of energy use to population change in the middle-income group is about 1.7, significantly greater than in the low- (0.601) and high-income groups (1.196). Similarly, the elasticity of energy use to changes in income in the middle-income group is 0.30, notably greater than in the low-income group (0.18), but slightly smaller than in the high-income group (0.376). The impact of the share of industrial activity in the economy on energy consumption is positive, but statistically significant for only the low- and middle-income groups. The contribution of the share of services in GDP to energy consumption is positive, but statistically significant for only the middle-income group.\n\nThe negative urbanization elasticity of energy use in the low-income group seems to support the argument of urban compaction. However, as many cities of this income group still lack basic public services, the negative elasticity is unlikely to be the result of economies of scale for public infrastructure. Rather, it could possibly be due to the effects of modernization, particularly the effect of improved access to modern forms of energy use. The findings are supported by Pachauri (2004) and Pachauri and Jiang (2008), who found that fuel switching from inefficient solid fuels to modern forms of energy use causes per capita household energy use in urban areas to be lower than in rural areas. It is evident that the share of biomass in total energy use in the low-income group significantly decreased from around 75% in 1975 to 66% in 2005 (see Fig. B(b) in Appendix B).\n\nAs described previously, further urbanization in the high-income group seems to increase rather than to decrease energy use. This supports the argument of the urban environmental transition theory that consumption-related issues are most pronounced in high-income countries. Unlike the other income groups, the high-income group uses much private and public infrastructure in supporting their urban population and urban economies. Constructing, maintaining and operating the infrastructure involve significant amounts of energy resources. Moreover, consumption patterns and lifestyles in cities of developed countries tend to be more resource intensive than in the cities of developing countries. High levels of energy use in the high-income group also reflect in Fig. 1(a).\n\nTable 6 reports the results for the whole sample, whereas Tables 7, 8 and 9 show the results for the low-, middle- and high-income groups, respectively. As the FD models (Models 20, 24, 28 and 32) address all important econometric concerns, our main interpretations focus only on these models.\n\nThe estimated results of Model 20 (Table 6) are all statistically significant at the 5% level or lower, except for the coefficients of economic structure. The results show that population size, GDP per capita, urbanization and energy intensity positively influence emissions. A 1% increase in urbanization raises emissions by 0.447%, all other factors being equal. The elasticity of emissions to population growth is 1.125, indicating a moderately elastic relationship, while the elasticities of emissions to GDP per capita and energy intensity are approximately one, suggesting a unit elastic relationship. The coefficients for industry as percent of GDP and services as percent of GDP appear positive but statistically insignificant.\n\nHowever, the results of Models 24, 28 and 32 indicate that the relationship between urbanization and emissions varies across the different stages of development. The urbanization elasticity of emissions in the middle-income group is 0.512, greater than in both the low- (0.43) and the high-income group (0.358). The effects of population growth, GDP per capita, economic structure and energy intensity are also heterogeneous across the different income groups. The elasticity of emissions to population change in the low-income group is about 1.75, significantly greater than in the middle-income group (1.228) and in the high-income group (1.122). Similarly, the impact of income and energy intensity on emissions in the low- and middle-income groups is larger than in the high-income group. These results are consistent with the findings by Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2007) and Shi (2003). Like Model 20, none of the coefficients for economic structure in Models 24, 28 and 32 is statistically significant.\n\nIt should be noted that in the low-income group, the relationship between urbanization and energy use is negative, while the relationship between urbanization and emissions is positive. This phenomenon could occur as this income group shifts from traditional fuels (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
