For example, Gilley et al. (2000) provided an event study focusing on the announcement of product- and process-driven environmental initiatives. While they found no overall effect of such announcements on stock returns, the results of their study suggest differences in the market reaction with regard to the specific type of the environmental initiative announced. In particular, the stock market reacted more positively to product-driven initiatives compared to process-driven initiatives. Robinson et al. (2011) investigated how the stock market reacted to the inclusion of firms in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and found significant increases in market value for the firms being included in the index. Keele and DeHart (2011) examined the market reactions to the announcement of firms’ participation in the USEPA Climate Leaders program and found no statistically significant market reaction on the day of the announcement.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the efficient market hypothesis is not free from criticism. In particular, behavioral finance scholars have challenged the different forms of the efficient market hypothesis (e.g., Shleifer 2000).\n\nWhile the events examined by event studies are admittedly single discrete events, they signal cumulative environmental performance and future positioning to the marketplace (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). For example, an announcement of green supply chain initiatives can be considered a public signal with regard to a firm’s decision towards a proactive environmental strategy. This information is deemed to be rapidly impounded in the stock price so that a change in its value implies a change in the market assessment of a firm’s net present value and thus reflects the market’s perception of the financial impact of signaled CEP (Gilley et al. 2000; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996).\n\nSeveral theoretical arguments have been put forward with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP involving different manifestations and mechanisms (Guenther and Hoppe 2014). In particular, the early literature rooted in neoclassical economics (e.g., Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958) argued that environmental activities would withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance because the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs. Furthermore, drawing on agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976), scholars suggested that managers could opportunistically employ corporate resources to engage in environmental activities that enhance their own utility at the expense of good financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2008). For instance, managers may try to justify disappointing financial outcomes by engaging in conspicuous environmental activities (Preston and O’Bannon 1997).\n\nIn contrast, other scholars have argued that CEP can have a positive impact on CFP. Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995) noted that pollution can be seen as a waste of resources and thus the reduction of a firm’s environmental footprint may also strengthen its competitiveness leading to a “win–win” situation. In particular, the NRBV (e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provides arguments for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities (both tangible and intangible), leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan 2005; Hart and Dowell 2011). Thus, proactive environmental strategies focusing on pollution prevention and environmentally sound product development may entail the development of organizational resources and capabilities and stimulate organizational learning (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Hence, improving CEP may help in attracting and retaining a higher quality workforce (Turban and Greening 1996), may foster innovativeness (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Surroca et al. 2010), and may enhance decision-making.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nprocesses and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman and Keim 2001; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).\n\nAlong the lines of Freeman’s (1984) stakeholder theory, it has been proposed that firms’ engagement towards improving CEP can be seen as potentially instrumental in obtaining necessary resources or stakeholder support and in mitigating the likelihood of negative regulatory, legislative, or fiscal action (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Cheng et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Jones 1995). Thus, superior CEP can increase customer demand (Hart and Dowell 2011), may improve reputation (Hart 1995), can contribute towards gaining legitimacy as a “license to operate” (Porter and Kramer 2006, p. 81), may decrease financial risk (Peloza 2009), and attract financial resources from environmentally responsible investors (Consolandi et al. 2009; Heal 2005).\n\nIn sum, there are several channels and causal pathways through which CEP might positively affect CFP. Moreover, the meta-analytic results provided so far are in favor of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, while these meta-analyses did not incorporate the data provided by event studies, a meta-analytic examination of event study results would be particularly useful because event studies, despite some critical issues concerning the proper design and sound application (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999), exhibit several outstanding features.\n\nFirst, focusing on stock market reactions obviates the need to analyze accounting-based measures of CFP, which may be subjected to potential manipulations due to choices regarding different accounting procedures (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; Richard et al. 2009\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) is a stock market index that evaluates the sustainability performance of companies based on environmental, social, and governance criteria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USEPA CLIMATE LEADERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The USEPA Climate Leaders program is an initiative by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that encourages companies to develop greenhouse gas inventories and reduce emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
