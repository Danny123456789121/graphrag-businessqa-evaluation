The more engage the stakeholders, and the more will influence the dialogue creates influences sustainability. Internal and external stakeholder pressure shape the policymaking process. In this study, organizational barriers identified include rigid disciplinary (lack of room for initiative), lack of evaluation systems, and the participation of public sector institutions in organization follow its CS policy published on its websites. It identified that the services cost of the pollution they produce, and it is an essential support for successful CS policy. The focus remained on minimizing policy where the organizations internalize the effective implementation of CS policy.\n\nThird, a proactive approach to the CSR policy in the private sector is less likely to implement the environmental policies. This study emphasized the role of SME can obtain their services and can help in CS knowledge. The identified factors affecting the policy include unclear priorities.\n\n# Stakeholder theory\n\n# Institutional theory\n\n# Reasons for SMEs investment in\n\nTranslate CS into practice and to environmental management and environmental policy statements.

Thus, it is emphasized that practitioners should devise the CS policy and corporate policy as a single/combined policy.\n\nAfter a thorough review of relevant articles, a total of five significant factors were identified which could influence the policymaking process (see Table 5). In these five factors, most of the scholars debated on the role of government/public sector institutions and stakeholders. Apart from these two, the organizational barriers have also appeared from the articlesâ€™ review as a significant factor (see Table 7). The elements in the organizational barrier need a focus to address the CS issues for better results.\n\nBased on the literature reviewed, barriers and enablers are identified, which has further two types each, following is the detail of barriers and enablers.\n\nSelf-regulations/subsidiarity and normative references are also important factors identified. The importance of normative references cannot be overlooked for the organizationsâ€™ better quality products and services.\n\nThe facts which have come to the foreground after a thorough review show that at a different level of the public sector (macro and meso-institution), different stakeholder and different business models need to adopt an adequate policymaking approach among identified different policy approaches (see Table 4) for their success to achieve sustainable development for the better future of organizations.\n\n# Evaluative study\n\n# Concluding remarks\n\nFahey and Pralle (2016) argued that environmental policy research lacks in underdeveloped countries, and they call for more research in less wealthy countries around the world. Armstrong and Kamieniecki (2019) shed light on the importance of common sustainability challenges such as climate change. They emphasized the public sector pursuing sustainability problems in isolation and need to collaborate with the stakeholders for shared understanding and better policymaking.\n\nWith the overview of the literature, it is learned that policymakers of the organizations also need to strategize the\n\n# Environ Sci Pollut Res (2021) 28:10335â€“10356\n\n# Table 7 Barriers and enablers\n\n|S #|Internal barriers|Author(s)|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|Poor plans|Orji (2019)|\n|2|Poor suppliers|Orji (2019)|\n|3|Lack of finances|Orji (2019); Klewitz et al.
