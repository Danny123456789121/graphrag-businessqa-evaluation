These means are somewhat smaller than those reported in prior meta-analyses (Margolis et al., 2007: 0.13; Orlitzky et al., 2003: 0.18).\n\nIn part, this is due to the fact that our study relies less on self-report data than earlier work (9% vs. 35% for Orlitzky et al., 2003). This has a deflationary effect, since self-report studies usually show larger effect sizes. Yet there is also an independent time effect at play. Even when measured objectively, the effect of CSR on CFP wanes over time (is 0.14 for studies published before 1998, but only 0.03 for studies published later), suggesting that the...\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Because few effect sizes are based on archival and third-party rater data are close to the overall, those based on sub-group HSMA analyses reveal the presence of methodological artifacts: whereas the sizes are based on survey data (12.7% of the r-based effect size distribution and 7.4% of the rxy.z-based distribution), removing these effects has no material consequences. When we break down our results by individual stakeholder groups, we find a few effects that are statistically significant but none that seem materially important. Like Orlitzky and associates (2003), we find CSR to be (somewhat) more strongly linked to accounting-based measures of performance than to market-based measures in the r-based distribution (r-based mean = 0.07 vs. 0.06). But in the rxy.z-based distribution we found CSR to be more linked to market-based measures of performance than to accounting-based measures (rxy.z-based mean = 0.04 vs. 0.03). Finally, we found limited evidence for moderation by industry context, with the exception of the financial service industry in the r-based distribution (r-based mean = 0.23).\n\n# MASEM results and hypothesis tests\n\nTable 3 contains the meta-analytic correlation matrix. Each of the 45 cells below the diagonal reports the results of a separate HSMA analysis for each bivariate relationship. We report both the observed correlation and the 95 percent confidence interval, total number of observations (N), as well as the total number of samples (k) on which the meta-analytic mean is based. Since no primary sample included all correlations included in our model, the total number of samples far exceeds the number of samples in any single cell.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n# Results\n\nTable 4 contains the results pertaining to our Hypotheses 1 through 5. Figure 3 visually presents these same results. The model fits the data well (χ2 = 122.25; RMSR = 0.024; GFI = 0.99).\n\n# Hypothesis 1\n\nHypothesis 1 is supported. CSR is positively related to firm reputation (β = 0.10, p < 0.05), and firm reputation is positively related to CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that is channeled through firm reputation is 0.005 (p < 0.05). A formal test for statistical mediation corroborates these findings (Sobel: z = 2.65, p < 0.01).\n\n# Hypothesis 2\n\nHypothesis 2 receives marginal empirical support. CSR is positively related to stakeholder reciprocation (β = 0.04, p < 0.05), which in turn has a positive effect on CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05), but the Sobel test is only borderline significant (z = 1.77, p < 0.10) and the total indirect effect of CSR that flows through stakeholder reciprocation amounts to only 0.002 (p < 0.05).\n\n# Hypothesis 3\n\nHypothesis 3 is supported. CSR is negatively related to firm risk (β = -0.04, p < 0.05), and firm risk is negatively related to CFP (β = -0.09, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that is channeled through firm risk is 0.004 (p < 0.05) and the Sobel test is significant (z = 2.08, p < 0.05).\n\n# Hypothesis 4\n\nWe also found support for Hypothesis 4. CSR has a positive and significant effect on innovation capacity (β = 0.07, p < 0.05), and innovation capacity positively affects CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that flows through innovation capacity is 0.004 (p < 0.05) and the Sobel test is significant (z = 2.53, p < 0.05).\n\n# Hypothesis 5\n\nHypothesis 5 is rejected, however. On the one hand, the Sobel test confirms that the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly channeled through the four hypothesized pathways (z = 4.51, p < 0\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
