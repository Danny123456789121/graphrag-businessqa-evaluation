These are the so-called physical risks related to climate change, that we do not tackle in this paper directly. However, it has been shown that rising temperatures have strong adverse effects on asset valuations, as well as on key macroeconomic aggregates and productivity (see Donadelli et al., 2017). Second, in a medium-term perspective, the implementation of sustainable finance policies will imply higher costs for firms with higher emissions, causing a generalized drop in the dividend that brown firms will be able to pay to their shareholders. In parallel, carbon-intensive assets will increasingly become ‘stranded’ (see Campiglio et al., 2017). This is the so-called transition risk. These two channels characterize a climate risk factor that investors should price.\n\nBased on our model, we estimate that in an extreme but plausible scenario where greener and more transparent companies outperform brown companies, all institutional sectors at the global level, including e.g. governments, non-financial institutions and financial corporations, as well as all European SIFIs, would be hit by losses. By halving their exposure to carbon-intensive sectors and reallocating their investments towards greener assets, investors could somewhat reduce the loss. However, they could only avoid losing money if they would reallocate their investments towards greener and more transparent firms. The magnitude of the expected losses we estimate is admittedly not breathtaking. Still, we show that no one is in a safe place when it comes to climate risk, as the consequences of brown asset mispricing would be widespread. Moreover, our analysis is limited to equity holdings, that for some investors are not as relevant as other types of exposures. In a stressed scenario, however, losses would almost certainly be recorded also on the bond portfolio and notably, on banks’ loan exposure. Finally, we use a simple model to compute losses, based on the marginal expected shortfall. This approach does not factor in losses resulting from second-round effects, like fire sales, which could magnify first-round losses. Taking all this into account, we conclude that a climate or climate-policy shock could have serious implications in terms of financial stability, especially if coupled with shocks of other nature. Hence, we argue that a climate stress test is warranted for systemically important institutions to monitor their resilience to climate change. The greenness and transparency factor we construct could indeed be used by investors, to hedge against climate risk, and by supervisors, to measure SIFIs exposure to this risk. Notice that looking ahead, we can only expect greater policy pressure to reducing carbon.\n\n3See Daniel et al. (2016).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n# emissions and moving to a sustainable development path.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide an overview of the relevant literature. In Section 3, we present our synthetic greenness and transparency indicator at the level of the individual company. Section 4 outlines the asset pricing theoretical framework. In Section 5, we present the results of the empirical application. First, we focus on portfolios by estimating the standard asset pricing models and defining the greenness and transparency factor. Then, we estimate our proposed model on individual stocks. In Section 6 we carry out a battery of robustness checks. Section 7 tests the performance of the equity portfolios of global institutional sectors and European SIFIs in a climate-stressed scenario. Section 8 concludes.\n\n# 2 Related literature\n\nThis paper stands at the crossroad of sustainable finance, asset pricing and financial stability. The sustainable finance literature has so far mostly focused on corporate performance, starting from the seminal work by Bragdon and Marlin (1972). They asked the fundamental question, whether there would be a reward for a company’s virtue. Trying to answer this question, Porter (1991), Gore (1993), and Porter and van der Linde (1995) argue that improving a company environmental performance can lead to a better economic or financial performance, not necessarily accompanied by an increase in costs. Ambec and Lanoie (2008) review several empirical works showing that improvements in the environmental performance of a firm tend to be associated with improvements in its economic or financial performance, owing to potential revenue increases and/or cost cuts. More recently, Hoepner et al. (2018) show that engagement on sustainability issues can benefit shareholders’ by reducing firms’ downside risks.\n\nDespite increasingly available evidence on the performance of green or sustainable corporates, however, no consensus has yet been reached in the asset pricing literature about the performance of green assets, or on environmental risk being a priced macro factor. Evidence based on a large number of studies on the performance of sustainable investment funds compared with conventional peers (e.g., Statman, 2000; Renneboog et al., 2007; Seitz, 2010) is mixed. For example, Hartzmark and Sussman (2019) find that sustainability is viewed as positively predicting future performance; however, they do not find evidence of outperformance of ‘high sustainability’ investment funds vs ‘low sustainability’ ones. Trinks et al. (2018) show that divesting from fossil fuels does not impair portfolio performance. On the contrary, Bolton and Kacperczyk (2019) find that stocks of companies with higher CO2 emission intensity earn higher returns. Other analyses based on publicly traded environmental portfolios find that green stocks are, on average, underperforming the market. This finding would indicate that investors are willing to earn comparatively less on these assets because they are hedging an environmental long-run risk. Finally, recent papers attempt to build climate risk hedging portfolios (see Engle et al., 2020, Choi et al., 202\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
