Additionally, ProcessGPT’s ability to learn from successful investigation patterns, legal precedents, and evolving crime trends empowers it to improve its analytical skills continuously. This evolution ensures that ProcessGPT remains a reliable resource, guiding investigators through complex cases by suggesting relevant leads, recommending potential courses of action, and keeping them updated with the latest developments in the ﬁeld.\n\n# VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this position paper, we proposed using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology to generate new processes to facilitate decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process-related data and models, and then fine-tuning it on specific process domains to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. Through the integration of natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the model can provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Additionally, the model can automate repetitive tasks, improve process efficiency, and enable knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings and make informed decisions.\n\nThe application of ProcessGPT in business process management can bring a transformative change. We are exploring the full potential of ProcessGPT in different domains, such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Additionally, a deep dive into the ethical and legal implications of ProcessGPT will be explored. Another line of research focuses on the scalability and sustainability of ProcessGPT to ensure its long-term viability as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workﬂows. In the following, we discuss a few future directions and ongoing works.\n\n# Understanding Conversations\n\nProcessGPT can beneﬁt from improved natural language understanding capabilities, allowing it to more accurately comprehend and interpret complex instructions, queries, and context. Advancements in this area would enable more precise and context-aware automation and augmentation. As an ongoing work, we are exploring various techniques such as semantic parsing, entity recognition, and coreference resolution to extract deeper meaning from conversations. Additionally, advancements in natural language understanding can be coupled with contextual reasoning and world knowledge integration to enhance ProcessGPT’s comprehension of speciﬁc domains.\n\n# Domain-Specific Knowledge\n\nProcessGPT can be further developed to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and expertise, making it more effective in supporting specialized workﬂows. By integrating specific industry knowledge, regulations, and best practices, ProcessGPT can provide tailored guidance and automation in various sectors such as healthcare, education, finance, and law enforcement.\n\n# Advanced Decision Support\n\nProcessGPT can evolve to offer advanced decision support by incorporating probabilistic reasoning, risk analysis, and predictive modelling. This would enable it to assist knowledge workers in complex decision-making processes, providing insights and recommendations based on sophisticated analysis of data and patterns.\n\n736\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Wien Bibliothek.

Restrictions apply.\n\n# Multi-Modal Capabilities\n\nExpanding the capabilities of ProcessGPT to handle multi-modal inputs, such as text, images, videos, and audio, would open up new possibilities for automation and augmentation. This would allow ProcessGPT to analyze and interpret information from diverse sources, enriching its understanding and enhancing its ability to support complex workflows.\n\n# Collaborative Workflows\n\nFuture developments in ProcessGPT could focus on facilitating collaborative workflows, enabling seamless cooperation and interaction between human users and the AI system. This would involve real-time collaboration, shared decision-making, and synchronized task management, fostering a productive and synergistic partnership.\n\n# Ethical Considerations\n\nAs ProcessGPT continues to advance, ethical considerations become increasingly important. Future directions for ProcessGPT will prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability, ensuring that the system operates ethically and respects user privacy and data security.\n\n# Privacy-Preserving Techniques\n\nAs an ongoing work, we are considering developing privacy-preserving techniques to allow organizations to leverage the benefits of ProcessGPT while ensuring the protection of sensitive or confidential information. This could involve federated learning, differential privacy, and secure multi-party computation techniques.\n\n# Integration with Existing Systems\n\nAn important line of work will focus on researching techniques to seamlessly integrate ProcessGPT with existing software and systems used in organizations. This would facilitate smooth interoperability and enable ProcessGPT to leverage and enhance the capabilities of existing tools and platforms. This line of work will also involve studying user needs, preferences, and workflows to create a seamless and productive user experience that optimally combines human expertise with ProcessGPT’s automation and augmentation capabilities.\n\n# Continuous Learning and Improvement\n\nOne promising future direction is to focus on developing sophisticated feedback mechanisms that facilitate user interactions and knowledge exchange. By actively soliciting feedback from users, ProcessGPT can learn from their expertise and incorporate it into its decision-making processes. This feedback loop can involve techniques such as reinforcement learning, where the system learns through trial and error based on the outcomes of its actions, or active learning, which involves selecting informative data points to improve model performance. Moreover, exploring methods to leverage new data continuously is another crucial avenue of research.\n\n# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe acknowledge the Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, for funding this research.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\n1.
