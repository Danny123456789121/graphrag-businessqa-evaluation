Effective holistic sustainable supply management schemes require the evaluation and selection of suppliers. Supplier evaluation requires the balancing of multiple criteria. Multiple criteria tools, each with advantages and limitations, are necessary for the supplier evaluation and selection problem. This paper introduces a new methodological approach including complementary, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques and Bayesian networks (BN). The combination of DEMATEL, AHP and Bayesian approaches, although they are supportive and complementary methods, has seen limited investigation. The Bayesian network approach can complement DEMATEL and AHP to help improve the accuracy of AHP input data. Alternatively, DEMATEL and AHP can provide expert and more objective inputs for intangible factors, used in the Bayesian network approach. The validity and efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a real industrial case using decision-makers’ inputs and outputs. The study shows the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we present results with managerial and research implications and future research directions.\n\nKeywords: Bayesian network; AHP; DEMATEL; sustainable supplier evaluation; supplier selection; supply chain management\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nIn today’s business environment, most organizations have realized the critical nature of the relationship with suppliers and the importance of the strategic decision to evaluate and choose the best suppliers. Thus, many organizations refer to their suppliers as partners. On the other hand, organizations need to coordinate all their business activities, considering sustainability issues to gain competitive advantages [1]. Therefore, this relationship is no longer based on economic aspects.\n\nSelecting a supplier is a strategic decision from multiple perspectives including customer satisfaction, technological ability and general business performance. Expanding this issue through sustainable supply chain management makes the choice and evaluation of suppliers even more critical and complex. Not surprisingly, the literature on sustainability and supplier selection (SS) is increasing. If selecting a supplier is a complex issue, selecting a sustainable supplier is even more complex. The dimensions to consider increase geometrically. New techniques that provide insightful knowledge and practical tools are required.\n\nThe implementation of sustainable practices is affected by different external factors. Ref. [1] stressed the necessity to be more involved not only in the internal process but also including.\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 10584; doi:10.3390/su122410584 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\nthe inter-organizational business systems and relationship with partners along the supply chain. Moreover, the implementation of sustainable initiatives is a complicated task without the cooperation with all partners in supply chain network. Therefore, the selection of suppliers based on integrated sustainability criteria using relevant methods can help companies to improve their sustainability performance. However, many present decision-making models regarding supplier selection focus on economic and environmental issues and less on social factors [2].\n\nMany studies have reviewed the literature on supplier selection (SS) [3–5]. Indeed, the literature on supplier selection is extensive. Multiple criteria decision-making model (MCDM), mathematical programming (MP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are some of the more popular approaches [6]. MCDM provides a methodological framework for decision support systems; MP is used to optimize or evaluate SS; AI identifies approximate solutions for complex optimization problems. MCDM approaches are the most popular, and within MCDM, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is most often applied [7]. AHP is very effective in ranking and selecting decision problems. It could be used alone or combined with other methods. Interaction and interdependent relationships among the evaluation criteria are critical and should be considered in order to evaluate a sustainable supplier [8]. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) can be valuable for this purpose.\n\nIn practical decision-making situations, the supplier selection problem is uncertain and imprecise. In risk assessment, researchers consider Bayesian network (BN) analysis as a helpful methodology for decision support under uncertainty. Although Bayesian analysis has been used for this issue [9], BN has not been used.\n\nMore precisely, more efforts are needed to take advantage of efficient techniques for selecting sustainable supplier in real cases [9]. In this sense, this research aims to answer the following research question: how to improve sustainable supplier selection and evaluation by using complementary approaches?\n\nGiven this situation, this study has the following objectives to answer the identified research question:\n\n- To provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem;\n- To propose a new decision-making tool using combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods in an uncertain environment for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers;\n- To validate the proposed approach in a real case and provide some managerial and research insights.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature about supplier selection (SS) and sustainability in order to provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem. AHP, DEMATEL and BN for supplier selection problems will be the focus. The new approach, AHP-DEMATEL-BN, is explained and tested with a real\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NADINE KAFA<|>PERSON<|>Nadine Kafa is a researcher affiliated with Kedge Business School in France, contributing to the study of sustainable supply chain management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANICIA JAEGLER<|>PERSON<|>Anicia Jaegler is a researcher at Kedge Business School, collaborating on the study of sustainable supplier selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSEPH SARKIS<|>PERSON<|>Joseph Sarkis is a researcher at the Foisie School of Business, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, focusing on decision-making in supply chain management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEDGE BUSINESS SCHOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kedge Business School is an educational institution in France where researchers study business practices, including sustainability in supply chains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOISIE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Foisie School of Business is part of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where research on supply chain management and decision-making is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability 2020 is a journal that published the research on sustainable supplier selection and evaluation methods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supply chain management involves the oversight and management of supply chain activities to maximize customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AHP is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, used in the context of supplier selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECISION-MAKING TRIAL AND EVALUATION LABORATORY (DEMATEL)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DEMATEL is a method used to visualize the structure of complex decision problems, particularly in supplier selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAYESIAN NETWORK (BN)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BN is a statistical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies, applied in decision-making under uncertainty.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NADINE KAFA<|>KEDGE BUSINESS SCHOOL<|>Nadine Kafa is affiliated with Kedge Business School, where she conducts research on sustainable supply chain management.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANICIA JAEGLER<|>KEDGE BUSINESS SCHOOL<|>Anicia Jaegler is affiliated with Kedge Business School, collaborating on research related to sustainable supplier selection.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSEPH SARKIS<|>FOISIE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS<|>Joseph Sarkis is affiliated with the Foisie School of Business, contributing to research on decision-making in supply chain management.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NADINE KAFA<|>JOSEPH SARKIS<|>Nadine Kafa and Joseph Sarkis are co-authors of the research on sustainable supplier selection.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANICIA JAEGLER<|>JOSEPH SARKIS<|>Anicia Jaegler and Joseph Sarkis are co-authors of the research on sustainable supplier selection.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>NADINE KAFA<|>Nadine Kafa's research on sustainable supplier selection was published in the journal Sustainability 2020.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>ANICIA JAEGLER<|>Anicia Jaegler's research on sustainable supplier selection was published in the journal Sustainability 2020.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>JOSEPH SARKIS<|>Joseph Sarkis's research on sustainable supplier selection was published in the journal Sustainability 2020.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP)<|>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT<|>AHP is a method used in the context of supply chain management for decision-making and supplier selection.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION-MAKING TRIAL AND EVALUATION LABORATORY (DEMATEL)<|>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT<|>DEMATEL is a method applied in supply chain management to visualize complex decision-making problems.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAYESIAN NETWORK (BN)<|>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT<|>BN is a statistical model used in supply chain management for decision-making under uncertainty.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
