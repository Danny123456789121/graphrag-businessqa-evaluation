The accounting sector can play a role in environmental conservation efforts related to environmental costs, and the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) could be a key factor that can improve the company’s financial performance. This study aims to determine how green accounting through the application of CSMS can improve the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country. The sampling method used was purposive sampling, while the research sample consisted of 38 companies that had followed PROPER and were indexed on the IDX. Data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs by earmarking a portion to carry CSMS implementation so as to improve financial performance. People in Indonesia consider that manufacturing companies that have good company rankings in the evaluation program for company performance ratings in environmental management run by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment are in a position to generate customer loyalty, especially in financial performance.\n\n# Keywords\n\nGreen Accounting, Financial Performance, Corporate Sustainability Management System\n\n# JEL Classification Code\n\nQ56, Q58, G23\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe increasingly numerous and varied human activities have an impact on the natural environment. People in meeting their daily needs can have an impact on the environment. Environmental impacts occur because humans tend to exploit natural resources from the environment in an excessive manner, not just maintaining the necessities of life. As a result of these human activities, the environment is damaged. Environmental damage is getting worse along with the development of industrial and technological companies. In the end, environmental damage has a negative impact on human life. On the one hand, industry has an impact on the environment, but on the other hand, the industrial world can have an impact on the economic development of a country. Companies in managing natural resources have the potential to impose negative risks on environmental aspects. For this reason, companies need to make a commitment to the environment and the social dimension as the main and inseparable part of the company’s operational activities. In making it happen, the company complements its operational activities with environmental management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations, for example, the Environmental Impact Analysis Documents. Environmental management efforts aim to estimate the impact that will arise from operations, evaluate, and find appropriate solutions to overcome them.\n\nFrom the increasing impact of a company’s activities on environmental issues and nature conservation, the...\n\n# Footnotes\n\n1.

An accounting system that discloses accounts related to environmental costs is known as green accounting. Disclosure of environmental activities and environmental costs in the company’s annual report will provide an overview to users of the company’s financial statements, which can help users make decisions for company programs related to environmental preservation in the future. The environmental conservation program carried out by the company will be positively perceived by the community. In the end, the community will have high trust in the company. The trust that arises will encourage people to be loyal to the company. Environmental performance can have a significant effect on a company’s financial position (Miroshnychenko et al., 2017). It also shows the need for adequate environmental cost information. Green accounting, in this case, is one of the sources of a company’s financial performance. Besides that, corporate sustainable development also plays an equally important role.\n\nSustainability stands out among the most vital management paradigms that key business leaders must react to today in search of competitive success (Bansal, 2005; Fakir & Jusoh, 2020). Bansal (2005), a leading author, argues that almost inevitably companies that do not react to sustainability will face extinction. Likewise, some say that the capability to incorporate sustainability into corporate strategy and stakeholder engagement will determine which businesses will\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>I DEWA MADE ENDIANA<|>PERSON<|>I Dewa Made Endiana is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, Denpasar, Indonesia, and the first author of the study on green accounting and corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NI LUH GD MAHAYU DICRIYANI<|>PERSON<|>Ni Luh Gd Mahayu Dicriyani is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, Denpasar, Indonesia, and a co-author of the study on green accounting and corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MD SANTANA PUTRA ADIYADNYA<|>PERSON<|>Md Santana Putra Adiyadnya is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, Denpasar, Indonesia, and a co-author of the study on green accounting and corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I PUTU MEGA JULI SEMARA PUTRA<|>PERSON<|>I Putu Mega Juli Semara Putra is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, Denpasar, Indonesia, and a co-author of the study on green accounting and corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF MAHASARASWATI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Mahasaraswati is an educational institution in Denpasar, Indonesia, where the authors of the study are employed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDONESIA<|>GEO<|>Indonesia is a developing country where the study on green accounting and corporate sustainability was conducted, focusing on manufacturing companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE, ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business is the publication in which the study on green accounting and corporate sustainability was published.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN ACCOUNTING<|>EVENT<|>Green accounting refers to the accounting practices that incorporate environmental costs and sustainability into financial reporting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>The Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) is a framework that companies can implement to improve their financial performance while being environmentally responsible.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I DEWA MADE ENDIANA<|>UNIVERSITY OF MAHASARASWATI<|>I Dewa Made Endiana is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, where he conducts research on green accounting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NI LUH GD MAHAYU DICRIYANI<|>UNIVERSITY OF MAHASARASWATI<|>Ni Luh Gd Mahayu Dicriyani is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, contributing to research on green accounting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MD SANTANA PUTRA ADIYADNYA<|>UNIVERSITY OF MAHASARASWATI<|>Md Santana Putra Adiyadnya is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, involved in the study on green accounting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I PUTU MEGA JULI SEMARA PUTRA<|>UNIVERSITY OF MAHASARASWATI<|>I Putu Mega Juli Semara Putra is a lecturer at the University of Mahasaraswati, participating in the research on green accounting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN ACCOUNTING<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<|>Green accounting is a practice that can be enhanced through the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System to improve financial performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDONESIA<|>GREEN ACCOUNTING<|>The study on green accounting was conducted in Indonesia, focusing on its impact on manufacturing companies.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE, ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS<|>GREEN ACCOUNTING<|>The study on green accounting was published in the Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
