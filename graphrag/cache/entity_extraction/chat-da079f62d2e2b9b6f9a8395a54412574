It is usually preferred methodologically. The authors conducted a homogeneity test with the R package to determine whether a fixed- or random-effects model should be used. Under the assumption of homogeneity (H0: β1 = β2 = β3 = ... = βk), the test statistic Q has a chi-square distribution with df = (No. of studies − 1). In the authors’ database, Q is equal to 275.3655 (df = 118, p < .001); thus, we rejected the null hypothesis that all effect sizes are equal. For this reason, the authors chose the random-effects model to conduct this meta-analysis.\n\n# Table 1\n\nsummarizes the number of effect sizes, cumulative sample sizes, corrected correlations, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals around the corrected correlations for each pairwise relationship. Providing support for Hypothesis 1, the authors obtained a significant, positive correlation for the relationship between CSR and CFP (r = .0587, p < .001). In addition, the results report the I2 index, which is interpreted as the proportion of total variation due to heterogeneity between studies (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). As a rule of thumb, I2 of 25%, 50%, and 75% can be considered as low, moderate, and high heterogeneity. In the study database, I2 is equal to 73.65%, which means that a high degree of heterogeneity exists among the conclusions on the relationships between CSR and CFP. A further investigation on the moderating effects on this relationship will be discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.\n\n# Filešdrawerš analysis\n\n262—5,2187,369\n\n95%šCI[0.01,š0.05][0.05,š0.07]    [−0.03,š0.05][0.05,š0.08]\n\nšvalue 8.45170.4583.39498.0887\n\n.šCIš=šconfidencešinterval;šCSRš=šcorporatešsocialšresponsibility;šCFPš=šcorporatešfinancialšperformance.\n\n| |z|SE|r|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Corrected|.0587***|0.0069| |\n| |.0678***|0.021| |\n| |.0319***|0.0094| |\n| | |0.0084| |\n\n# ThešRandom-EffectsšModelšResultsšofšthešMeta-Analysis.\n\n|Totalšsamplešsizeš(150,706)|N|Numberšofšeffectšsizesš(11927)|k|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| |39,913|125,085|9,423|\n\n# OverallšCSRšandšCFPp\n\nRelationshipsšCFPšCSRConcurrent\n\n# Table•1.\n\npš<š.01.\n\npš<š.05.š***\n\nCSRšCFPš                            Notep\n\nš<š.1.š**\n\n14\n\n# Wang et al.\n\n# 15\n\nFurthermore, the authors examined the causal direction between CSR and CFP. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the instrumental stakeholder theory is supported by the primary studies. The corrected coefficient between prior CSR and subsequent CFP is equal to .0319 (p < .001, N = 39,913), which means Hypothesis 2a is supported. However, the slack resources theory has not been supported. The positive association between prior CFP and subsequent CSR is not significant in this meta-analysis. Concurrent studies facilitate a positive corrected coefficient, which is equal to .0678 (p < .001, N = 125,085).\n\n# Sensitivity Analysis\n\nAlthough the meta-analysis is very powerful, it is not without problems. The file drawer problem is known as a publication bias. Nonsignificant findings are less likely to be submitted and accepted for publication. So the published findings are more likely to be significant than unpublished findings. In this study, the authors conducted a file drawer analysis to get the number of unpublished papers with null effect required to neutralize the average effect. As shown in the last column of Table 1, it will require 7,369 unpublished studies with null effect to subvert the positive relationship between CSR and CFP. The cross-sectional result is also robust, which requires 5,218 unpublished studies to challenge the positive results. As suggested by Rosenthal (1991), the file drawer tolerance is set at 5X + 10, where X = number of studies. Although the fail-safe number on the relationship between prior CSR and subsequent CFP is just 262, it is more than sufficient for the tolerance level (70).\n\n# Results\n\nTo investigate the moderating effect of different measurement strategies on the relationship between CSR and CFP, the authors divided all the samples into five subgroups based on the operationalizations of CSR and three subgroups based on the operationalizations of CFP. The authors followed the guidelines provided by Viechtbauer (2010) to conduct a QM test to examine the moderate effects. QM test based on the levels of a categorical moderator is a frequent practice in meta-analyses (Viechtbauer, 2010). The value of QM is equal to 151.1894 (p < .0001, df = 5), which indicates that the different types of operationalizations of CSR are significantly moderating the relationship between CSR and CFP. In other words, the relationships based on different measurement strategies of CSR are significantly different (see Table 2).\n\n# Moderating Effects of Meta-Analysis of CSR Operationalization\n\nCSR = corporate social\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
