Moreover, organizations could obtain other instant benefits, such as corporate credibility (Schneider and Clauß, 2020), greater market engagement (Kannothra et al., 2018; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020), and competitiveness (Fosfuri et al., 2016) by positively reacting to sustainability paradoxes, which would contribute to long-term value creation.\n\n# Long-Term Effects\n\nScholars have usually used synergistically increased organizational economic and social performance to depict sustainability success, even though economic and social pursuits could be detrimental to each other in the short run (Margolis and Walsh, 2003) and the effects on social or environmental performance are assumed only to manifest after a long period of time (Hoffman et al., 2010). Typical indicators of economic performance include profit, sales, or their annual rates of increase (Pache and Santos, 2013). Social performance is reflected in greater social impact, such as higher social employment.\n\n# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management\n\n(Pache and Santos, 2013; Battilana et al., 2015; Smith and Besharov, 2019), community regeneration (Slawinski et al., 2020), and community income increase (Kannothra et al., 2018). Proactive responses to the corporate sustainability paradox, which is the determining precondition for a virtuous cycle (Smith and Lewis, 2011), have been verified to enhance economic and social performance simultaneously (Crilly and Sloan, 2012; Pache and Santos, 2013; Smith and Besharov, 2019).\n\nBy contrast, defensive reactions that would lead to a vicious cycle cannot facilitate sustainable development (Smith and Lewis, 2011). Defensive responses, which are usually argued to be a potential barrier to sustainability, may counterintuitively bring some positive effects (Ferns et al., 2019). For example, a luxury leather producer that sells recycled material to other tanneries and refuses to produce inferior leather itself (a defensive strategy) successfully maintains the trust of its customers toward their own product quality (Daddi et al., 2019).\n\n# AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\n\nIn this study, using the PRISMA methodology, the authors reviewed the existing research with a paradox perspective on sustainability. By adopting Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, the authors revealed how the prior sustainability literature concerns the investigation of the manifestation process of tensions among sustainability goals, the management strategies that organizations use to respond to the tensions, and resulting outcomes.\n\nDuring synthesizing and mapping of previous studies, ample future research opportunities appear. First, the authors propose that the nature of the corporate sustainability paradox (i.e., its constitution vs. its social construction) requires further exploration, including theoretical clarity and empirical examination. In the mainstream organizational paradox literature, there is an ontological debate on whether paradoxical tensions are inherent in the system or socially constructed (Clegg, 2002; El-Sawad et al., 2004; Ashcraft et al., 2009). Smith and Lewis (2011) propose an integrative approach by arguing for the corporate sustainability paradox’s dual nature in simultaneously highlighting the roles of material conditions and organizational actors during the manifestation process. With a quantum approach, Hahn and Knight (2020) conceptualize the paradox as both inherent and socially constructed (for a counterpoint, see Li, 2020).\n\nThis debate penetrates sustainability research and potentially shapes management strategies. With a few exceptions, such as Sharma and Bansal (2017), who directly bring the opposing poles together by revealing the interaction between action and cognition, the nature of the sustainability paradox in the current literature is yet to be fully explored. Rather than looking for clues as to whether the researcher holds a material view (e.g., Waldman and Bowen, 2016) or a socially constructive view (e.g., Child, 2020; Vallaster et al., 2020), this fundamental question requires more in-depth exploration.\n\nSecond, it is desirable to investigate the sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations. When investigating management of the corporate sustainability paradox, the main focus of the existing literature is on social enterprises or non-profit organizations, not for-profit organizations (Smith et al., 2013; Battilana et al., 2015; Wry and York, 2017; Child, 2020). Yet tensions are also embedded in the often hybrid forms of for-profit organizations, bringing paradox management insights to researchers (e.g., Smets et al., 2015; Acquier et al., 2018; Schneider and Clauß, 2020). Moreover, for-profit organizations, originally holding a business logic, may experience hurdles that are significantly different from those of social enterprises when pursuing corporate sustainability. Therefore, drawing from the “tensions” between researching social organizations and for-profit business organizations, the authors suggest that an organization’s form (non-profit vs. for-profit) could largely influence how the organization responds to and manages the sustainability paradox.\n\nThird, the authors encourage more research on the micro-foundation of management of the corporate sustainability paradox. Organizational psychology would shed light on this line of research. There is a need to explore how the cognitions, attitudes, and emotions of managers and employees (cf., Chin et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020) play a role in corporate sustainability paradox management. For instance, the significant role of paradoxical thinking is reflected in its dual effect. On one hand, individuals with the paradoxical frame are more acutely sensitized to and aware of the interconnections among seemingly opposing demands.
