Recently, there have been quite a few reviews in the area of how the application of AI is shaping HRM. Generative AI can be used in HRM to improve the recruitment process, training and development initiatives, outcome of resource allocation, employee engagement, and so on. The outcomes of HRM decisions, such as who gets hired, better appraisal, preferred projects, and even terminated, have serious impacts on individuals, organizations, and society that are concerned about fairness toward different stakeholders, procedural and distributive justice, as well as ethics.\n\nFor example, in the recruitment process, generative AI can automate the extraction of the candidates’ information from their resumes and guide recruitment managers to selectively focus on more suitable applicants so that there is greater fit between the job roles and the hired candidate. Furthermore, keeping in view the applicant’s requirements for more effective job searches on digital platforms such as LinkedIn, the recruitment process have demonstrated reverse assessment of the job’s relevance to potential candidates and making recommendations accordingly. Similarly, generative AI has been utilized for assessing employee engagement by accessing their social media profiles and mining the text of user-generated content using natural language processing and social analytics. This application of social media analytics and natural language processing offers companies an opportunity to compare employee sentiments on a real-time basis and therefore measure brand engagement across geographies. The utilization of generative AI to assess and monitor employee engagement practices open up opportunities for the enhancement of employee engagement policies at the organizational level.\n\nGenerative AI is envisioned to significantly influence HRM in the years to come and provide mechanisms for the digital transformation of talent management functions in a holistic way.\n\n# Opportunities\n\nThere are several opportunities when companies start implementing generative AI in HRM. It is envisioned that generative AI may be used to automate recruitment process queries, improve learning outcomes of training and development initiatives, team dynamics, the outcomes of resource allocation challenges among employees, employee engagement, as well as minimize employee turnover.\n\nFor example, one of the largest areas of application could be when opportunities are created and advertised in firms. Potential applicants could query the platforms.\n\n# 10 K.-B. OOI ET AL.\n\nwhich may be enabled by generative AI to explore the details of the opportunities. Structured queries can be addressed by utilizing generative AI. Hence, when hundreds (or even thousands) of interested applicants try to apply, they are often challenged by queries surrounding their eligibility, fit, and status of the selection process. Generative AI can enable automation of the query resolution processes in a very structured yet human-like mode to which the person raising the queries may not even feel that the responses have been generated by a ML algorithm and feel more satisfied with the process.\n\nSimilarly, employees across a geographically dispersed company may face challenges due to a mix of local administrative and global practices. If an employee exhibits dissonance on social media about issues that can be addressed, generative AI may provide a mechanism to track employee dissonance on a real-time basis and create a ticket to address the concerns of the employee. This will not only boost the morale of the complaining employee but also others who may not be complaining but have the same feelings. In addition, due to cultural differences among geographically dispersed offices of an organization, an employee who may be facing challenges in coping with organization deliverables may be connected with other colleagues within the talent network by generative AI for mentoring and support during stressful times. Activities undertaken for prompt redressal of employee concerns may also assist in reducing employee turnover.\n\n# Challenges\n\nFor understanding the possible challenges of using generative AI in HRM, we would have to revisit the fundamental building blocks of generative AI which are extended from the principles of AI. Biases and limitations are likely to be present in generative AI applications.\n\nGenerative AI models would need to be trained on a very large corpus of data. If the data does not have adequate representation of different employee groups, designations, cultures and ethnicity, challenges may be present in the recommendations generated by the model which would demonstrate fairness toward all employees. Fairness of generative AI may not appear very challenging while implementing projects but may have very strong adverse outcomes on the fabric of inclusive work norms and practices in an organization. Employees may face this challenge even more if the firm is a multinational enterprise and employees belong to diverse ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds with diverse demographics.\n\nAs generative AI tools operate within a black box, the algorithmic implementation of transformer architectures or deep learning models like long-short-term memory do not explain the reasons behind a generative AI response to a query. Variation of responses, especially for inaccurate responses, may...\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\nnot be explainable. This may create challenges in HRM and damage the organizational harmony among employees regarding functions such as employee appraisals and resource allocation if ineffective outputs are generated by generative AI and subsequently adopted for decision-making. The lack of transparency in predictions may create a lack of trust not only on the generative AI system but also among coworkers and the institution which will have adverse effects beyond adoption.\n\nGenerative AI tools may present issues of bias in enterprise applications. Challenges in applications developed using generative AI may stem from confounding bias if the algorithm interprets the wrong relations by not considering all the information residing in the knowledge bases of the firm or if it misses the important relationships between query features and outputs. Generative AI tools may also demonstrate effects like sampling biases and negative set biases. In view that generative AI tools are trained on the knowledge that is explicitly documented, it implies that the firm must first experience these specific use cases. Therefore, the unchartered territory of queries and usage may lead to a response by the generative AI tool that is inaccurate or inappropriate. If unchecked, such response can result in undesirable outcomes on employee morale and group dynamics.\n\n# Generative AI in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
