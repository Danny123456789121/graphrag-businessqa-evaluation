In Model 2, the variables of interest are added. Consistent with H1a and H2a, we find that firms with high existing levels of female board representation and high levels of board independence are significantly less likely to be targeted by gender diversity proposals. The estimated Î± coefficients on Female Representation and Board Independence are -16.67 and -2.18, both significant at the 0.01 level. Notably, the R2\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Our results are quite similar to those in Model 2. In Model 3A, where we compare firms targeted by socially-motivated activists with non-targeted firms, we find that targeted firms have significantly lower Female Representation and Board Independence than non-targeted firms. In Model 3B, where we compare firms targeted by financially-motivated activists with non-targeted firms, we find similar results. Of primary interest, however, is Model 3C where we compare firms targeted by socially-motivated activists with those targeted by financially-motivated ones. Here we find that none of the control variables is significant in distinguishing between activist type, but we do report significant differences for one of our main test variables. Firms targeted by financially-motivated activists have significantly lower Female Representation (Î± = -14.67, p = 0.01), consistent with H1b. This suggests that these proponents believe that they are likely to be most successful when targeting firms with few or no females on the board, that greater potential gains will accrue to these firms, or both. We do not find significant differences across the two groups for the variable Board Independence, and therefore H2b is not supported.\n\n# Sensitivity Tests\n\nIn (untabulated) sensitivity tests, we repeat the analysis in Table 5 using a one-to-one random match to identify non-targeted control firms. The explanatory power is much higher in the random match model because of the higher significance of the variable Firm Size, which we use in Table 5 to identify matched controls but do not use in the random match model. Other notable differences are that Board Size is significantly negative in Models 2.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Most importantly, the results are very similar for our main variables of interest, Female Representation and Board Independence, compared to those based on the size-industry match, i.e., they are significant in all specifications, and our inferences remain unchanged.\n\nAs an alternative specification, we also estimate Model 2 using a sample of all firm-years with the requisite data. Because we have only 143 target firm-years and 21,664 non-target firm-years in this analysis, we employ the penalized likelihood estimation, or Firth Method, as an approach for reducing small-sample bias in maximum likelihood estimation (King & Zeng, 2001). The results are very similar to those reported above in Table 5. The coefficients for Female Representation and Board Independence are negative and significant at the 0.0001 level.\n\nCollectively, these results suggest that activists target firms with low female representation and lower board independence with gender diversity proposals. Further, we find that firms targeted by financially-motivated activists have even lower levels of female representation compared to those targeted by socially-motivated activists.\n\nInsert Table 5 about here\n\n#\n\n# The Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism\n\nTo assess whether shareholder proposals related to increasing gender diversity are effective, we examine female board representation from year -1 through year +2, where year 0 represents the year the sample firm was targeted. We define the variable Change in Female Representation as the change in the percentage of female members on the board from year -1 through year +2. We obtain data on female representation from RiskMetrics. For this analysis, we require sample firms/years to have all four years of data, resulting in a drop in sample size from 143 to 120. In order to attribute observed changes to shareholder activism,\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nwe employ a one-to-one-matched pair design to control for other changes to board composition that might have occurred during our period of interest. We select control firms based on propensity score matching, which allows us to identify control firms that are most similar to our sample firms in terms of the likelihood of being targeted. The target model used to generate propensity scores is based on the most important variables in Table 5, namely Female Representation, Board Independence, Firm Size, Profitability, and Board Size. We also match by year and require the control firm to be in the same industry, defined by 2-digit SICs, as the sample firm.8\n\nUnivariate results are reported in Table 6. In Panel A we report the proportion of boards that have at least one female board member for both the 120 target and 120 non-target firms. In the year prior to being targeted, only 21.7 percent of target firms have at least one female board member; by year +2 this percentage increases to 57.5 percent. Therefore, 35.8 percent of target firms increased their female board representation from zero to at least one female board member from year -1 to year +2, an increase that is significant at the p = 0.01 level.\n\nControl firms that had similar characteristics to targeted firms\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
