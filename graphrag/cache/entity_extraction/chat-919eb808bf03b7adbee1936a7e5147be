Significant heterogeneity suggesting the presence of moderating effects is indicated when the Q statistic is significant and the I2 statistic suggests that there is a significant amount of variance attributed to true differences (i.e., I greater than 75%) (Allan et al., 2018)2.\n\nOne potential problem of meta-analysis is the file drawer problem, also called publication bias, which refers to circumstances in which “the research that appears in the published literature is systematically unrepresentative of the population of completed studies” (Rothstein et al., 2005, p. 1). This might occur when the decision to submit or publish studies is influenced by the magnitude, direction, or significance of the study’s findings in such a way that findings that, for instance, are not statistically significant are less likely to be published (Geyskens et al., 2009). We addressed this issue by calculating the fail-safe N that provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to render the mean effect insignificant (Rosenthal, 1979).\n\nWe used the meta-analytically derived mean correlations between board characteristics and CSR, as well as the intercorrelations among the board characteristics, to conduct meta-analytic path analysis (Bergh et al., 2016; Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995). For this purpose, we used the meta-analytic correlation matrix as input for MPlus 8.2. Consistent with prior studies, we used the harmonic mean sample size from the correlation matrix as the sample size for our analysis (Allan et al., 2018; Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Meta-analytic path modeling allows us to examine simultaneously the relationships among the board characteristics and with CSR. Moreover, it enables us to test H6 about the (partial) mediation of the presence of a CSR committee.\n\nFor examining our hypotheses regarding potential moderating effects, we used random-effects meta-regression analyses (Jeong & Harrison, 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001), in which the dependent variable is the meta-analytically derived mean correlation for a certain relationship and the independent variables are the suggested moderators. A significant beta coefficient suggests that the examined factor moderates the focal relationship.\n\n# Results\n\n# Bivariate Analyses of the Relationships Between Board Characteristics and CSR\n\nTable 1 presents the results of the meta-analyses for the different relationships between board characteristics and CSR.\n\nFor the relationship between board size and CSR, we find a positive and significant mean correlation (r = .189; 95% CI = [.133, .244]), lending\n\n# Meta-Analytic Results for Board Characteristics and Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n| |Fail-safe|5391,416|Corporate Social| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval|(%)|97.32|98.03|95.58|92.85| | | |\n| |pQ|.000|.000|.000|.000| | | |\n| | |N|1,605|889|3,104|225|972.69|517.49|\n| |r|.189|.108|.203|.020| | | |\n|N| |88,502|54,268|127,143|74,179| | | |\n| |k|44|62|44|38| | | |\n|Female board representation—CSR (H3)| |Board independence—CSR (H2)|CEO–chair duality—CSR (H4)| | | | | |\n|Board size—CSR (H1)| | | | | | | | |\n\nNote.- k = Q\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\n# 19\n\nsupport for H1. In H2, we predicted a positive relationship between board independence and CSR. The meta-analytic effect size is positive and statistically significant (r = .108; 95% CI = [.062, .153]), thus supporting H2. Also H3, predicting a positive relationship between female board representation and CSR, receives empirical support (r = .203; 95% CI = [.159, .247]). Regarding the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR (H4), we suggested a negative relationship. The small and non-significant mean correlation (r = .020; 95% CI = [−.020, .060]) does not support this hypothesis.\n\nFor all significant relationships, the calculated fail-safe N suggests robustness of our findings in terms of a bias against the publication of null findings. The number of null-effect findings that would be needed to overturn the relationships are all above the tolerance level suggested by Rosenthal (1979).\n\nThe Q statistics and the I2 statistics reject the assumption of homogeneity for hypotheses H1 to H4. Thus, moderator analyses are warranted for all of these board characteristics–CSR relationships.\n\n# Meta-Analytic Path Model Results\n\nTable 2 shows the meta-analytic correlation matrix used as input to test our meta-analytic path model. We test a model (displayed in Figure 1) in which the presence of a CSR committee partially mediates the relationships between CSR and the other board characteristics: board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality. We allow those board characteristics, which displayed significant mean correlations in the meta-analytic correlation matrix (Table 2), to covary with each other. As reported in Table 3, the model fits the data in an acceptable manner (comparative fit index [CFI] = .958, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .056, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .022) and all\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
