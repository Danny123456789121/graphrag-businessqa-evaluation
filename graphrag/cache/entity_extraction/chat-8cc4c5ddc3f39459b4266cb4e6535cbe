Contrarily, Hypothesis 1a was not supported and our findings suggest that there is no significant relationship between process-based CEP and subsequent market-based CFP as the confidence interval includes zero (95% CI: .037 to .051). Hypotheses 1c and 1d, which dealt with the influence of outcome-based CEP on subsequent CFP, were confirmed; we found a positive effect of outcome-based CEP on subsequent market-based CFP (r = .096, k = 17, N = 22,789, p < .001) and on subsequent accounting-based CFP (r = .051, k = 20, N = 16,606, p = .033).\n\nHypothesis 2a, which proposed a positive relationship between process-based CEP and prior market-based CFP was not supported as the confidence interval includes zero (95% CI: .102 to .230). However, we found support for Hypothesis 2b, concerned with process-based CEP and accounting-based CFP (r = .124, k = 12, N = 5716, p = .010). Furthermore, we found no support for Hypothesis 2c, which proposed a positive relationship between outcome-based CEP and prior market-based CFP (95% CI: .003 to .162). Also our results indicated that there is no significant relationship between outcome-based CEP and prior accounting-based CFP (95% CI: .048 to .099). It is worth mentioning that the findings concerning Hypotheses 2a–d should be interpreted with some caution because the number of effect sizes for the different subsets is relatively small. Nevertheless, small numbers of effect sizes are in line with other meta-analyses (e.g., Kirca et al., 2012) and should not seriously affect the estimation results (Geyskens et al., 2006).\n\nHypotheses 3a and 3b, predicting a positive relationship between process-based CEP and concurrent market-based CFP and concurrent accounting-based CFP, were confirmed as we found positive relationships for process-based CEP and concurrent market-based CFP (r = .095, k = 24, N = 28,599, p = .001) as well as for process-based CEP and concurrent accounting-based CFP (r = .130, k = 55, N = 43,215, p < .001). We also found support for Hypotheses 3c and 3d, dealing with the relationship between outcome-based CEP and concurrent market-based and accounting-based CFP. Outcome-based CEP was positively related to concurrent market-based CFP (r = .167, k = 21, N = 15,200, p < .001) and to concurrent accounting-based CFP (r = .194, k = 29, N = 15,589, p < .001).\n\nSupporting Hypothesis 4, our findings indicated that the relationship varies depending on whether proactive or reactive approaches of CEP are applied (Q B = 6.348, p = .012). Moreover, as proposed, the relationship is stronger for proactive CEP (r = .138, k = 72, N = 54,361, p <\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
