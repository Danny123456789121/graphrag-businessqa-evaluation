Research Framework\n\nWe have used the Fuzzy Delphi, and FAHP approaches to finalize and prioritize the most important criteria and select sustainability options for the development of corporate sustainability. The framework operationalized in this study is shown in Figure 3. Fuzzy Delphi proposed by Hsu et al. [88] has been adopted in this study to finalize corporate sustainability criteria. The advantage of Fuzzy Delphi over the conventional Delphi method is that the latter is a lengthy process of obtaining a consensus on experts’ opinions. The expert’s opinion in the conventional Delphi method often suffers from low convergence, which ultimately complicates consensus-building. The experts are therefore consulted repeatedly to reform their feedback so that a possible consensus can be reached. On the other hand, Fuzzy Delphi can obtain experts’ consensus through only one round of investigation [89]. The Fuzzy Delphi uses membership functions to characterize the experts’ feedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.\n\nRegarding the development of the fuzzy membership degrees, most of the previous studies used a Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN), Gaussian fuzzy number, and trapezoidal fuzzy number [88]. This study employs TFNs, to construct the membership degree function. To find the converging point of the decision group, TFNs were solved using the geometric mean following previous studies such as [90,91]. In taking this approach, a FAHP methodology was used for computing the weights of the main and sub-attributes of corporate sustainability, supported by decision-makers\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability refers to the ability to maintain certain processes or states indefinitely, often in the context of environmental, social, and economic practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The Corporate Sustainability Model is a framework that organizations use to integrate sustainability into their operations and decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLAN, DO, CHECK, AND ACT<|>EVENT<|>The PDCA approach is a cyclical model used for continuous improvement in processes and products, particularly in corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUZZY DELPHI<|>EVENT<|>Fuzzy Delphi is a method used to obtain consensus among experts through a single round of feedback, particularly in decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAHP<|>EVENT<|>FAHP, or Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, is a decision-making framework that incorporates fuzzy logic to prioritize criteria and options.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERTS<|>PERSON<|>Experts are individuals with specialized knowledge or skills in a particular area, consulted for their opinions in the Fuzzy Delphi method.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MODEL<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>The Corporate Sustainability Model is a framework that aims to achieve sustainability in corporate practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLAN, DO, CHECK, AND ACT<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MODEL<|>The PDCA approach is a key component of the Corporate Sustainability Model for continuous improvement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUZZY DELPHI<|>FAHP<|>Fuzzy Delphi is used in conjunction with FAHP to finalize and prioritize sustainability criteria<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPERTS<|>FUZZY DELPHI<|>Experts provide their opinions in the Fuzzy Delphi method to reach a consensus<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
