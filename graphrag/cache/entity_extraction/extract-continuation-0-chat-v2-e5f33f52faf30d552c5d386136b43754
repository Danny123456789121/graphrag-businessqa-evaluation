Since several factors that are likely to influence stock market reactions to CEP-related events are dependent on country-specific institutional contexts (e.g., Bansal and Roth 2000; Baughn et al. 2007; Etzion 2007), future research exploring the national context-specific mechanisms that may account for the differences in more detail might yield important insights.\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\nAnother interesting avenue for future research may refer to the frequently expressed notion that the market’s awareness regarding environmental issues has increased over time (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Flammer 2013). The findings of the current study point in this direction as the population r calculated across studies examining stock market reactions to positive events that occurred before the year 2000 was not significant, contrary to market reactions to positive events occurring after the year 2000. Related to this, and probably even more interesting, is the question of why the increase in market reactions to CEP-related events seems to apply only to positive events but not to negative ones. Contrary to the finding regarding positive events, the rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000. This suggests that the stock market reactions to negative events may have not been subject to changes over time, while the reaction to positive events constitute a more recent phenomenon. One potential explanation may be that the negative financial effects of poor CEP arising from reputational damages or impeding fines and remediation costs have been well established for some time, while the beneficial effects of superior CEP resulting from competitive resources or improved stakeholder relationships have only recently been taken into consideration due to an increased attention on sustainability issues.\n\nFinally, future research could also focus on the differences with regard to the specific events examined in the event studies. In view of the fact that CEP must be considered a multidimensional construct (Trumpp et al. 2015) it is obvious that also CEP-related events address quite different aspects of CEP. Therefore, one potential reason for the variation of the study results may refer to the variety of different events such as environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996), product- and process-driven environmental initiatives (Gilley et al. 2000), inclusion and exclusion from the DJSI (Consolandi et al. 2009), or membership in voluntary environmental initiatives (Keele and DeHart 2011). While it would have been interesting to explore whether the variation of the study findings might be attributed to the qualitative differences of the particular events, the very diversity of CEP-related events and, associated therewith, the small number of sufficiently similar studies did not allow constructing meaningful subgroups for contrasting the effect sizes in this regard.\n\nTo conclude, this study adds to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by providing meta-analytic evidence for positive market reactions to positive CEP-related events and negative market reactions to negative CEP-related events. Thus, it indicates that CEP-related events affect the market’s estimates of future cash flow. Furthermore, the meta-analytic results demonstrate that the market reaction is asymmetric in that the reaction is stronger for negative events than for positive events. Finally, the analyses indicate the presence of moderation effects that could not sufficiently be explained by the subgroup analyses that were feasible on the grounds of the available data. Thus, this study entails the need for further research on this topic.\n\n# References\n\nReferences marked with an asterisk indicate studies included in the meta-analysis\n\n- Aguinis, H., Dalton, D.
