Wang & Qian, 2011). In this study, the authors have investigated the moderating effects of measurement strategies and environmental factors. But, for the shortage of relative data, firm-level moderators and other potential moderators, which might explain the variance across studies, have not been identified and examined, warranting further research in the future.\n\n# Business & Society\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCSR studies have improved over time with stronger theoretical rationales, more relevant operationalizations, and more and better controls for previously omitted variables, “yet the improved rigor has only produced rigor mortis” (Barnett, 2007, p. 796). Even after three decades of research, differences in perspective have only accumulated, not dissipated, thereby further obscuring the big picture (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). The meta-analytic review, together with extensive discussions and future research suggestions, may furnish a reference for further theory development, research design, and empirical analysis in the field. The authors hope that this review clarifies and solidifies scholarly knowledge of CSR and its value in enhancing financial performance.\n\nSynthesizing research findings of 42 empirical studies on the linkage between CSR and financial performance, this study endorses the prevalent argument that CSR enhances CFP. Furthermore, the authors explored the direction of the causation. The authors found that subsequent financial performance is positively associated with prior social responsibility, in support of the instrumental stakeholder theory. That theory suggests that firms can “do well by doing good.” However, the reverse direction is not supported in this study. That is, the evidence suggests that prior high level of financial performance has virtually no significant effect on firms’ subsequent social involvement.\n\nThe results of subgroup analyses confirmed the authors’ propositions that the heterogeneity of the CSR and CFP relationship may result from the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP. The empirical evidence implies that the relationship measured by surveys produces the strongest effect compared with the other four types of CSR measurements. Another subgroup analysis based on different operational measures of CFP shows that the perceptual measures are more highly correlated with CSR than accounting and market-based CFP. The final set analysis examined the moderating effects of environmental context on the CSR and CFP relationship. The results show that the relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.\n\n# List of 42 Studies Used for Meta-Analysis\n\n|CFP| |0.048|0.148|0.0219| |(continued)| | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|→|0.02|0.03|0.09| | |0.16−0.06| | | | | |\n|CSP|Concurrent|−0.001|0.01|0.03|0.067|0.151|0.07| | | | |\n|→| | |0.05| | |0.16−0.1| | | | | |\n|CFP|Overall|−0.001|0.01|0.03|0.067|0.151|0.0219|0.09|0.07|0.04|0.16−0.06|\n\n# ROA (3 years following the giving year)\n\n|CFP measure|Fund returns|Sales growth|Market-to-book ratio|Tobin’s Q|CAR|ROA| | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |22,512|4,019|4,113|178|1,618|1,204|354|2,765|\n\n# Study\n\nLev, Petrovits, and Radhakrishnan (2008)\n\nH.
