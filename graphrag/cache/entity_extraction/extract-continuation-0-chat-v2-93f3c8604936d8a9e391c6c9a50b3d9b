In certain national contexts, the relationship between CEP and CFP may be influenced by social norms, public pressure, and expectations regarding environmental practices (Pasquero 1991; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). In addition to attitudinal differences, variation in environmental regulations and enforcement may also influence the CEP–CFP link (Christmann 2000) with firms in countries with stricter regulations regarding environmental issues facing stronger threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). The use of US firms in much of the CEP–CFP literature raises questions as to the generalizability to other national settings where environmental regulation and laws differ. Interestingly, although much of the CEP–CFP research uses samples consisting of US corporations, the United States is one of the few industrialized nations not to have signed the Kyoto Protocol, the highly publicized global environmental initiative, leading to further issues of the relevance of broadly applying US-based studies. In today’s global business\n\nenvironment, the lines between domestic and international firms are blurred with the majority of companies having some degree of internationalization (e.g., importing/exporting supplies, products, subsidiary in other country, etc.). We focus here, however, only on the location of the firm’s headquarters. For example, Ford Motor Company, imports, exports, and has facilities in countries other than the US. However, Ford is still typically perceived as a US firm. Whereas, Toyota is not typically perceived as an American firm although the company has manufacturing plants and sells products in the US. Here, we attempt to answer the question, “Does CEP matter more or less for firms who are based in the U.S. than for internationally based counterparts?” In doing so, we hope to shed light on whether findings regarding the CEP–CFP link are generalizable to firms in other national contexts.\n\n# Industry—Worst Offenders Versus Others\n\nRegulatory differences for firms in certain industries may also influence the relationship between CEP and CFP. Specifically, it is possible that the “worst offenders,” firms in industries with negative reputations regarding environmental performance, may experience greater media attention and more pressure from NGOs, consumers, and governmental authorities, resulting in the potential for greater gains in organizational legitimacy through better environmental performance (Bansel 2005; Berrone and Gomez-Mejia 2009; Hoffman 2001). Moreover, executives in such high polluting industries, for example, may have less influence over the environmental performance given the nature of the business (Berrone and Gomez-Mejia 2009). A number of existing CEP–CFP studies have focused on the “worst offenders,” particularly high polluting industries (i.e., oil and gas, heavy manufacturing, EPA lists, etc.) (e.g., Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Christmann 2000; Clarkson et al. 2008; Freedman and Jaggi 1986). In addition to the contextual industry-level differences (i.e., regulatory and social pressure), the use of the “worst offenders” in longitudinal studies may also create issues with regression toward the mean making interpretation of results complicated (Trochim 2001). As such, researchers have emphasized the need for future studies to replicate CEP–CFP studies in other types of industries where the results of environmental performance may differ (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). Through meta-analytical techniques, we compare the results of studies using samples of firms from industries often considered to be the “worst offenders” and studies with samples representing firms from a broad set of industries to see if environmental performance matters more for firms in high polluting industries, than for firms in other industries.\n\n# Methodological Issues\n\n# Financial Performance Measure\n\nThe research methodology of the CEP–CFP literature has been the subject of past criticism. One methodological issue that is commonly raised is the lack of consistency in operationalizing the independent (i.e., environmental performance) and the dependent (i.e., financial performance) variables. The lack of uniformity in measures has been thought to be a reason for some of the inconsistent findings in the literature (Greiffen and Mahon 1997; Ullman 1985). For example, while competitive advantage resulting from reputational benefits of positive environmental performance, reduced risk perceptions, and meeting the needs of stakeholders may be reflected in market-based measures, accounting measures may be better indicators of efficiency and organizational capabilities (Orlitzky et al. 2003). Additionally, some financial performance measures may represent short-term performance gains (e.g., stock-price), whereas others may represent more long-term financial viability (e.g., ROE). Thus, we may expect different outcomes based on the choice of the financial performance variable (i.e., ROA, stock-price, sales growth, market share, etc.). A second methodological issue is that past research has not consistently considered the potential for a lag between a firm’s environmental performance and subsequent financial performance results raising issues of causality. Therefore, we compare studies which measure environmental and financial performance simultaneously to those studies in which the dependent variable, financial performance, is lagged for 1-year or more. A better understanding of if and how CEP affects different measures of financial performance will assist managers in their decision-making regarding environmental initiatives. We provide an analysis of these potential differences.\n\n# Environmental Performance Measure\n\nEnvironmental performance has also been measured using a variety of objective and non-objective measures using data such as independent databases (e.g., KLD; Turban and Greening 1997), self-report surveys from managers (e.g., Judge and Douglas 1998), and pollution indicators (e.g., TRI: Clarkson et al. 2008).
