The sample companies engaged in manufacturing that go public and are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and publish financial reports (annual reports) in 2018-2019.\n2. The companies selected as samples were manufacturing companies that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management for 2018-2019.\n\nThe number of samples of PROPER companies in the period 2018 to 2019 was 38 companies, so that the number of observations was 76, as shown in the following table.\n\n# 3.1. Green Accounting\n\nGreen accounting is the company’s performance in creating a good (green) environment. Green accounting companies are measured by the company’s achievements in participating in the PROPER program, which is one of the efforts undertaken by the Ministry of Environment (KLH) to encourage corporate governance in environmental management through information instruments. The PROPER performance rating system includes the ranking of companies in five colors, which will be scored consecutively with the highest score of 5 for gold and the lowest score of 1 for black.\n\n# 3.2. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\n\nBased on Dočekalová and Kocmanová (2016), the measurement of corporate sustainability is using Complex Performance Indicator (CPI). CPI integrates the environmental, social, economic and corporate governance performance of the company. CPI contains seventeen key performance indicators, which were determined from the basic set of performance indicators using statistical methods. CPI sums up the complex corporate performance into a single value, but, at the same time, the set of aggregated sub-indicators of individual performance areas enables a detailed analysis and determination of the impact of various performance areas and factors on the complex corporate performance. Figure 1 visualizes the scheme of composite corporate performance indicator - Complex Performance Indicator.\n\n# I Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\n\n# Figure 2: Research Model\n\nDeletr Pest Dracoce: GA: Green Accounting, CSMS: Corporate Sustainability Management System, FF: Financial Performance\n\n# 4. Research Results and Discussion\n\n# 4.1. Research Results\n\nBased on the results of mediation analysis using PLS warp the following results are obtained: The summary of the modeling test results is shown in Table 2.\n\nThe results of the fit model and quality indices in Table 2 indicate that the research model meets all the conditions for fit from the research model, so that it is suitable for use in explaining the population.\n\n# 3.3. Financial Performance\n\nPerformance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. The company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability. Measurement of the profitability ratio can use ROA (Return On Asset). Return On Assets, or also known as economic profitability, is operating profit with own capital and foreign capital used to generate profits and expressed as a percentage (Platonova et al., 2018). This ratio is used to measure the rate of return on investment that the company has made using all its assets.\n\n# 4.2. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\n\nThe first hypothesis states that green accounting is able to improve CSMS in manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The analysis result shows that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.15, so that the first hypothesis can be accepted. This indicates that the increasing implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia is able to increase the implementation of CSMS. Accounting in this case, especially in green accounting, proves that it is able to support the sustainable development of the company. We know that green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The ability of companies to apply green accounting in their business, to be able to manage costs related to the environment and to have an impact on the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. The results of this study are aligned with the research by Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) that states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.\n\n# 3.4. Analysis\n\nThe analysis technique used in this research is inferential statistical analysis to explain the causal relationship between variables. The inferential statistical method used in data analysis in this study is variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which is known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method, with the PLS warp tool. The research model is shown in Figure 2.\n\n# 4.3. Green Accounting on Financial Performance\n\nThe second hypothesis states that increasing green accounting can improve financial performance. The analysis results show that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.27.\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\n\nI Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\n\nThese results indicate that the company implementing green accounting is able to show good environmental performance, so the impact is on good financial performance. So, the second hypothesis can be accepted.
