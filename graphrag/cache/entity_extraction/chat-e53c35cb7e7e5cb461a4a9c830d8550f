The method of meta-analysis that this article does use is explained below.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThis article makes use of a direct weighted linear combination of estimators method of meta-analysis, developed by Hedges and Olkin (1985). They developed a testing procedure for a fixed-effects categorical data.\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nmodel, such as the one this study fits. The test procedure employs Hedges's g, a commonly used effect size estimator; that makes use of t statistics and sample sizes the only two pieces of data this study could make use of. (Throughout this article, an n will represent the sample sizes of the event studies meta-analyzed. It will range from 5 to 535, as Table 3 indicates. An N will represent the sample size of the meta-analysis itself; typically, N=27. Hedges's g has a chi-squared distribution and is defined by the following formula (Rosenthal, 1994: 238):\n\ng = 2tVn\n\nStudies of Hedges's g, however; have shown it to have a small sample bias, and because this meta-analysis has several studies with very small sample sizes, the estimator d was used to correct for the bias (Hedges and Olkin, 1985: 81):\n\nd = 1 - An - 9 g3\n\nThe variance of the estimator d is given by the formula:\n\nvar(d) = n -1n 2n\n\nwhich is the two-sample variance formula modified because the event studies meta-analyzed here are one-sample studies. The two-sample formula is var(d) = [(n' + nTntn] + d/2n\" 2n7, where n' is the sample size of the experimental group, and nf is the sample size of the control group. Taking n' + nf = n, the single-sample formula is obtained by setting nf = 1, the smallest positive integer for n' possible, because setting nf = 0 in the two-sample formula will produce an undefined result (Rosenthal, 1994: 238).\n\nIt should be mentioned here that this meta-analysis makes no attempt to weight the studies on quality. There are two reasons for this. First; weighting schemes that involve weighting for anything other than sample size (accomplished in this meta-analysis by Hedges's g and they should be applied with caution and viewed as are not recommended: primarily exploratory in nature\" (Shadish and Haddock; 1994: 264).\n\nSecond; because event study methodology was standardized by the early to mid-1980s, it can be argued that all the studies meta-analyzed here are roughly equivalent in quality: Three procedures were followed for analyzing the data: a test for homogeneity, a test for significance, and a computation of effect size.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\nPerform these procedures, Hedges and Olkin (1985: 163) give computational formulas, intended to facilitate computer programming, involving the ds and their variances. (Essentially, the sums of the reciprocals of the variances are used to weight the effect sizes.) The components of these sections are the following:\n\n- TW = total of weights (reciprocals of the variances) X[Ivar(d)]\n- TWD = total of weighted ds = Z[dlvar(d)]\n- TWDS = total of weighted d squares = E[dIvar(d)]\n\n# Test for homogeneity\n\nIf the underlying population of effect sizes is not the same across all the studies, then any attempt to group the effect sizes and analyze them will be questionable. A test for homogeneity is needed to determine if indeed the effect sizes could be coming from the same population. Only if the null hypothesis that the data are homogeneous is retained is it possible to proceed to a test for significance and to the calculation of a single estimate of effect magnitude. The general procedure to be used for a fixed-effects model for which observed effect sizes are being combined from a series of independent studies is explained succinctly in Shadish and Haddock (1994: 265-68). The specific procedure used in this meta-analysis is described in much more detail in Hedges and Olkin (1985: 147-65).\n\n# The test statistic (TS) for homogeneity\n\nRecommended by Hedges and Olkin (1985) is chi-square distributed, with degrees of freedom equal to N - 1. The test statistic and procedure are based on a total weighted sum of squares method (with effect sizes being weighted by the reciprocals of their variances), given by Hedges and Olkin as:\n\n(TS) = E_d var(d) / (var(d) 2 - 1 var(d))\n\nOT, in its computational form; as:\n\n(TS) = TWDS - (TWD)² / TW\n\n# Test for significance\n\nThe null hypothesis for this test is that the population effect size, D, is zero. The test for significance is performed on the weighted grand mean or the weighted average effect size over.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nstudies. The weighted grand mean, @dlva(dV[EIvar(d)J, is standardized by its standard error of estimate [ElIvar(d)]-I, This gives the following formula (Hedges and Olkin; 1985: 152):\n\n(TS)z =X- varld) Z_1d  var\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
