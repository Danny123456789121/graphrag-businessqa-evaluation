We estimate that direct losses could amount to 1.5% of the global equity exposure, and to USD 7 bn for European SIFIs overall. By adding up second-round effects and losses on loans and other assets, this figure could rapidly increase. We calculate that halving investors’ exposure to carbon-intensive activities would decrease losses only marginally, while only a radical portfolio reallocation towards greener assets would ensure resilience. Based on our results, and considering that we only focus on equity exposures, we argue in favor of introducing climate stress tests for systemic financial institutions to make sure that climate risk is suitably addressed.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\npriced. The approach we propose to assess climate risk in equity portfolios is based on a simple and well-known methodology, the marginal expected shortfall, and could easily become part of a broader stress-testing exercise.\n\nGiven that the awareness of investors towards climate-related issues has clearly increased in recent years, it would make sense to estimate a model with a time-varying risk premium. As discussed, this presents challenges in terms of estimation, and will be the object of future research. Another interesting avenue relates to the drivers of the Greenium, and in particular to the hypothesis that its negative sign could be driven by an increasing ‘taste for green’ among investors.\n\n26\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n# References\n\nAcharya, V., Pederson, L., Philippon, T., and Richardson, M.
