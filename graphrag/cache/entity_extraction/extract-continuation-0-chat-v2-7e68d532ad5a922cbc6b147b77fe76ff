Friede\n\ntransparent by the meta-analyses’ authors (n = 404) or needed manual corrections (n = 38), the final study sample comprises 1214 (n) unique studies. Manual corrections were necessary for author typing errors, different years (i.e. published vs unpublished version), or adding or changing ‘a’ or ‘b’ when two different studies of the same author team appeared in the same year. When retrieving the primary study information from the meta-studies, we coded it in a unique form as author1, author2, …, author i (year). For 45% of studies (n(1) = 551 primary studies), the first-order meta-analyses provided data about effect sizes. On the basis of this information, it was possible to calculate a conventional first-order meta-analysis (so-called second-order omnibus meta-analysis).\n\n# Coding\n\nBesides the basic identifier information: (1) we retrieved a variety of methodological information. This included the meta-analytical approach, the family of reported effect sizes, if and how corrections for sampling and measurement error were taken, and, finally which attenuation factors were used. (2) We collected the granularity of primary studies (transparency level of statistics, all effect sizes, N, k, and t-test). (3) Finally, we gathered all meta-analytical results for summary and sub-effects (effect sizes, attenuated and disattenuated variances, standard errors, credibility and confidence intervals, reliability information of dependent and independent variables, the overall reliability estimate, and results of the homogeneity test, significance tests, and Fail-Safe N analysis). If results for both fixed and random effects were reported, we selected the random effect. All transparent data in primary studies which were also included in a first-order meta-analysis were extracted (e.g. the study identifier and results like study size, effect size(s), and reliabilities). In some cases, rudimentary interpretation was needed. For these cases, two independent coders reviewed the context. The original inter-rater reliability was above 0.9.\n\n# Independence Considerations\n\nAn important prerequisite for conducting a second-order meta-analysis is statistical independence of individual first-order meta-analyses. This would require that the primary studies or samples used in one first-order meta-analysis not be included in any of the other analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). In fact, it is a typical case for second-order meta-analyses that this assumption cannot completely be met. Scholars therefore suggest that minimizing the lack of independence might be\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ERP ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ERP Environment is a publisher that focuses on environmental management and corporate social responsibility publications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>John Wiley & Sons Ltd. is a global publishing company known for its academic and professional publications, including works on environmental management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management is a journal that publishes research on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T.
