However, the low percentages of observed cross-study variance explained by artefacts, ranging from 20 percent to 26 percent, and large true-score variances ranging from .17 to .19, indicate the presence of at least one moderator. As Table 2b shows, consistent with the overall analysis (Table 1, entries 3.a and 3.b), the results are stronger after corporate environmental measures were removed from CSP. Generally, though, the relationships reported in Table 2b confirm the conclusions of Table 2a.\n\n# Mediator Variables: Learning and Reputation\n\nTo investigate Hypothesis 3, studies were divided into two broad subsets: (a) studies that correlated both internal and external measures of CSP with only accounting CFP measures (that is, measures of internal resource utilization, such as ROA or ROE); and (b) studies which correlated only externally visible measures of CSP, such as CSP reputation or disclosures, with exclusively external (for example, market return or sales growth) measures of CFP. The reputational argument is further subdivided into studies correlating external indicators of CFP with: (a) reputation indices of CSP; (b) CSP disclosures in annual reports and letters to shareholders; and (c) other externally visible measures of CSP such as social audits and charitable contributions.\n\nBased on the magnitude of the meta-analytic correlations, the meta-analysed studies support the reputation-effects viewpoint relatively more strongly than the internal viewpoint, as shown in Table 3 (compare first two).\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n# 24(3)\n\nFile Drawer refers to percentage of cross-study observed variance explained by three study artefacts: sampling error, measurement error in CSP, measurement error in CFP.\n\nVariance of down to .05.\n\nTrue findings needed to bring Correlations in subsets 1 and 2 do not add up to 388 because assignment to type of relationship was questionable in certain cases.\n\n# Table 3.

In addition, further hierarchical breakdown of the reputation view subset indicates that CSP disclosures appear to have a low reputational impact on CFP. This statistical conclusion is generalizable across study settings because a high proportion of variance (93 percent) is explained by study artefacts (entry 2.b in Table 3). Moreover, timing of measurement (temporal sequence) is not an important moderator within the ‘reputation view’ argument. As was the case in the overall meta-analysis, the correlations between CSP and subsequent CFP are almost identical to the ones found between CSP and prior CFP (ρ = .75 and .73, respectively; entries 2.a.1 and 2.a.2 in Table 3). Again, the correlations are highest when CSP and CFP were measured less than a year apart (ρ = .91, and 51 percent of cross-study variance explained by artefacts; entry 2.a.3).\n\n# Moderator Analysis\n\nThe analyses relevant to Hypothesis 3 already alluded to an important feature of Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) meta-analytic technique; namely, detection of cross-study moderators. Because this algorithm will be used extensively in the remaining meta-analyses, a brief explanation seems in order. Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) moderator analysis consists of two distinct methods. First, the ‘75% rule’ can be applied, stating that if 75 percent or more of the observed variance of correlations across studies is due to artefacts, then probably all of it is artefactual variance (on the grounds that the remaining 25 percent is likely due to artefacts not corrected for). Thus, in cases where 75 percent or more of the variance is explained by artefacts, including sampling error variance, moderators are unlikely to have caused a real variation in observed correlations (robs). This first method is able to detect the existence of unsuspected moderators.\n\nThe second method, which can detect discontinuous, theoretically predicted moderators, compares mean observed and true-score correlations across study domain subsets of the original entire set of studies aggregated in the meta-analysis. If in these meta-analytic subgroups, a higher percentage of variance is accounted for by study artefacts relative to the entire meta-analytic set, moderators are said to exist.\n\n# Measurement Strategy as Moderator\n\nTo examine Hypotheses 4a and 4b, the entire data set of 388 correlations\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Performance (CSP) refers to the measures and evaluations of a company's social and environmental impact and practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Financial Performance (CFP) refers to the financial health and profitability of a company, often measured through metrics like return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>PERSON<|>Hunter and Schmidt are researchers known for their meta-analytic techniques used in the analysis of correlations across studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 2b<|>EVENT<|>Table 2b presents findings related to the analysis of corporate environmental measures and their impact on Corporate Social Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 3<|>EVENT<|>Table 3 summarizes the meta-analysis results regarding the relationship between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPUTATION THEORY<|>EVENT<|>Reputation Theory examines how a company's reputation affects its financial performance and stakeholder perceptions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNAL SKILLS THEORY<|>EVENT<|>Internal Skills Theory focuses on how a company's internal capabilities and resources influence its financial performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Corporate Social Performance is often correlated with Financial Performance, indicating that better social practices can lead to improved financial outcomes.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>TABLE 3<|>Hunter and Schmidt's meta-analytic techniques are used to analyze the data presented in Table 3 regarding CSP and CFP relationships.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 2b<|>TABLE 3<|>Table 2b and Table 3 both present findings related to the analysis of Corporate Social Performance and its impact on Financial Performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPUTATION THEORY<|>INTERNAL SKILLS THEORY<|>Reputation Theory and Internal Skills Theory are both frameworks used to analyze the relationship between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
