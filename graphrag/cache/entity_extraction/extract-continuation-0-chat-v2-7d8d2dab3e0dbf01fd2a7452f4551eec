All three categories achieved a value higher than 0.8, with αsocial = 0.87, αenvironment = 0.87, and αgreen = 0.85. Consequently, based on the disclosure of the indicators, a sustainability score was calculated for each bank. First, we calculated the sum of the values for environmental, social, and green indicators. Then, the banks’ results were divided by the maximum achievable value to standardize the values for the banks’ performance in the respective category. Lastly, a sustainability score (SS) was calculated using the average of the environmental, social, and green scores. As a result, SS is an equally weighted combination of the environmental, social, and green products and services scores. The descriptive statistics of the categories and SS are presented in Table 4.\n\n# Table 4.
