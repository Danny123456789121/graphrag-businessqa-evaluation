(2007) and Shi (2003). Like Model 20, none of the coefficients for economic structure in Models 24, 28 and 32 is statistically significant.\n\nIt should be noted that in the low-income group, the relationship between urbanization and energy use is negative, while the relationship between urbanization and emissions is positive. This phenomenon could occur as this income group shifts from traditional fuels (biomass) to fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), which are more efficient but may have more CO2 emissions. The share of coal and oil in their total energy use increased from 21% in 1975 to 24% in 2005 (see Fig. B(a) in Appendix B). Over the same period, their carbon intensity exhibited an upward trend as illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\nAnother point worth noting is that the impact of urbanization on energy use of the high-income group is greater than that of the middle-income group, whereas its urbanization elasticity of emissions is smaller than that of the middle-income group. This can possibly be attributed to structural change in energy use. The high-income group significantly decreased the share of coal and oil in their total energy use from around 71% in 1975 to only 56% in 2005 (see Fig. B(a) in Appendix B). The tendency of fuel usage switching toward low carbon intensive fuels (e.g., natural gas and nuclear energy) is shown in Fig. 2(c). The carbon intensity of the high-income group significantly declined over the period 1975–2005. The share of coal and oil in the total energy use of the middle-income group also declined. However, its carbon intensity did not decline as steadily as that of the high-income group. This could possibly relate to differences in their technological efficiency.\n\nThe impact of urbanization on emissions not only varies across the three income groups, but also appears greater in the middle-income group. This trend conforms to the argument of the ecological modernization theory that the process of modernization may cause substantial environmental issues. However, further modernization can reduce these problems. Despite different environmental indicators, the findings are in line with previous research by Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. (2002), who found an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and deforestation rates. Fig. 3 summarizes the urbanization elasticities of energy use and CO2 emissions (derived from Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nUnlike previous studies, this paper investigated empirically the impact of urbanization on total energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of different levels of development using the STIRPAT model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005. The sample was divided into three different groups (low-, middle- and high-income groups), and they were separately analyzed. The results suggest that the effects of urbanization on energy use and emissions vary significantly across these income groups.\n\n# Urbanization elasticities of energy use and emissions\n\n(without consideration of income levels)\n\n| |Energy use|Emissions|\n|---|---|---|\n|1.0|0.8| |\n|0.6|0.447| |\n|0.4| | |\n|0.2| | |\n|0.0| | |\n|-0.2|-0.132| |\n|Low-income|Middle-income|High-income|\n\n(with consideration of income levels)\n\n| |Energy use|Emissions|\n|---|---|---|\n|1.0|0.8| |\n|0.6|0.507|0.907|\n|0.4| | |\n|0.2| | |\n|0.0| | |\n|Low-income|Middle-income|High-income|\n\n(with consideration of income levels)\n\n| |Energy use|Emissions|\n|---|---|---|\n|1.0|0.8| |\n|0.6|0.512| |\n|0.4|0.430|0.358|\n|0.2| | |\n|0.0| | |\n|Low-income|Middle-income|High-income|\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank two anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments.
