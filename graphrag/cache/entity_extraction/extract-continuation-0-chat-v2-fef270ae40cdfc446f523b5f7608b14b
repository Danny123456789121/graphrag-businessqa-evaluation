In particular, the estimated factor loading for the market factor bˆm is positive and significant across all models and portfolios. However, for the transparent as well as for the greener and more transparent portfolios, the exposition to the market factor is lower compared to the non-transparent and brown portfolios. This means that more transparent and greener firms tend to be less correlated with the market compared to more opaque and browner firms. The performance of the various portfolios can also be explained by the different loadings on the other factors. In particular, the exposition with respect to the size factor, bˆsmb, enters with a negative sign for the transparent and greener and more transparent portfolios, on the one hand, and a positive sign for the non-transparent and brown portfolios, on the other hand. This suggests that greener and transparent firms correlate more with bigger firms, while non-transparent and brown firms correlate more with smaller firms. Indeed, based on Table 12, firms in the greener and more transparent portfolio exhibit a slightly larger mean size as measured by total assets. As for the value factor ˆhml, the estimated loading is always negative and significant, except for the brown portfolio for which it is negative but non significant. Negative loadings on the value factor might mean that the portfolios include a comparatively larger share of firms with a lower book-to-market value. Considering the Carhart model, the coefficient on the momentum factor is not significant, except for the transparent portfolio. Looking at the explanatory power of the various models with respect to the different portfolios, the adjusted R-squared is lower for the brown portfolio based on all the models. Finally, the intercept is positive and significant for all portfolios and models, suggesting the existence of an omitted factor.\n\nWe define the greenness and transparency factor as the difference between the monthly returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio and those of the brown portfolio.
