Following this hypothesis, superior CEP initiates better CFP, which again allows companies to reinvest in CEP. This leads to a two‐way causality for the two constructs. The process might either begin with available financial slack or with an initial investment in environmental performance. This mutually supportive process might, however, also arise as a negative synergy (Allouche & Laroche, 2005).\n\n# 3 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS\n\nThis section describes the search for empirical studies and the subsequent preparation of data. Second, the statistical approaches of Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis and publication bias test are presented.\n\n# 3.1 Data search and preparation\n\nMeta‐analysis starts with the collection of available CEP–CFP studies. First, we gathered the sample of 149 primary studies used by Endrikat et al. (2014). In the next step, we extended their sample by studies published after 2012 using the same search strategy to search major databases for published research articles and grey literature using a comprehensive search term incorporating various keywords for CEP, CFP, and applied empirical methodology. At the end, the literature search left us with 198 relevant publications.\n\nTo identify the studies that are eligible to be included in our analysis, we adopt the following set of selection criteria on the sample of relevant work:\n\n- a. Studies examining disclosure data as proxy for CEP are dropped, because recent empirical analyses show an inconsistent and contradictory behavior in contrast to other frequently used measures as, for example, intensity of emissions (among others, Aragón‐Correa, Marcus, & Hurtado‐Torres, 2016; Hughes, Anderson, & Golden, 2001; Patten, 2002);\n- b. Because statistical aggregation of empirical results of many studies requires that the effect sizes are comparable across studies (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2012), event studies and findings from probit/logit models are excluded;\n- c. Each study has to report appropriate statistical results from regression analysis including regression coefficients, the corresponding standard error (or t‐statistics), and the underlying.\n\nThe screened databases are ABI/Inform Complete, Business Source Complete, EconLit, GreenFILE, ScienceDirect, and Social Science Research Network.\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\nsample size. This is necessary to extract the empirical effect population effect size and variation in the effect sizes only stems from between CEP and CFP in form of partial correlation coefficients. a study‐specific sampling error covered by the variance ν. However, it could be argued that the population effect size follows a normal distribution due to variation induced by random effects across the primary studies and effect estimates respectively. In order to account for such unobserved heterogeneity in the effect sizes, a random‐effects model is more appropriate incorporating a random‐effects component τ2 as shown in Equation (3). The latter is estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood estimator. This approach produces random‐effects weights calculated by the inverse sum of these two variance components. By including τ2 in the weighting scheme, the analysis accounts for typical drivers of heterogeneity in this field of research, such as measurement difference, regional differences, temporal effects, differences in study quality, study characteristics, and data characteristics. For the estimation of τ2 and further explanations of the HOMA procedure, please refer to Borenstein (2009), Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, van Essen, and van Oosterhout (2011), and van Essen, Otten, and Carberry (2015).\n\nThe partial correlation coefficient from Equation (1) measures the intensity of the CEP–CFP relation, while keeping constant all other variables in model.2 This effect size is preferable for our analysis due to several aspects. First, compared with the Pearson correlations, the effect of interest is corrected for spurious influences. Second, the use of Pearson correlations would lead to a smaller set of studies to be included. Furthermore, using partial correlations allows collecting multiple estimates from each study as most authors report empirical results for several regression models.\n\nAfter inspecting the appropriateness of each regression analysis in the collected primary studies, the sample of 142 primary studies provides a database of 893 partial correlation coefficients, which are obtained from 757,154 firm‐year observations.3\n\n# 3.2 | Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis\n\nFor the aggregation of reported effect estimates, we apply Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis (HOMA; Hedges & Olkin, 1985) in order to calculate mean effect sizes. Consequently, the mean effect size for a bivariate relation and its standard deviation are computed by:\n\nr = ∑ wi × ri and wi = νi + τ2;\n\n# 3.3 | Publication bias test\n\nAs typically applied in meta‐analysis, we investigate the presence of selective reporting of research results. Publication selection bias exists if specific estimates are systematically overrepresented in empirical literature (Rosenthal, 1979). This means that researchers favor statistically significant results or results that are in line with theory and previous research outcomes (Stanley, 2005). If publication selection bias is present in literature, the overall picture across the available literature will be distorted (Card & Krueger, 1995; Doucouliagos & Stanley, 2013).\n\nThe statistical analysis of publication bias is carried out by analyzing the relation between the observed effect sizes and their standard errors. Accordingly, the model can be formulated as follows (Card & Krueger, 1995):\n\nri = β0 + β1SE(ri) + εi  εi ∼ N(0, SE(ri))\n\nThe dependent variable ri is the i‐th partial correlation coefficient, SE(ri) is the standard error of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
