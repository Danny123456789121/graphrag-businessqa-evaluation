In addition, Fig. 1 depicts the results of sensitivity analysis while considering if includes the entropy weight calculated from social media data into the proposed hybrid method. The result indicated that there are four gaps existing in the criterion of C19, C17, C15, C10 which is consistent with the evaluation result. Thus, this study suggests that social media information can reveal the real situation of performing SRM practice, as well as present a more balanced CS development phenomenon among SRM criteria.\n\n# 5. Implications\n\n# 5.1. Theoretical implications\n\nThere is an obvious conflict between the economic growth and environmental protection in the industry when developing CS, because firms often assume substitutability between economic and environmental resources, and focus on relative efficiency gains, whereas largely ignores the rebound effect (Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl, 2013; Fuchs et al., 2015). The results show eco-efficiency can provide a trade-off towards an overall improvement. The aspect of eco-efficiency (A5) ranks first among all the aspects, referring that to reduce the consumption on natural resources needs to depend on encouraging environmental innovation (C16) and redesigning the consumers' offer (C18). Encouraging environmental innovation is important to achieving highly efficient production technology and methods to improve CS performance. Moreover, through encouraging environmental innovation, the industry can have the capacity to address preservation of natural resources, industrial efficiency and finally achieve the profit improvement. Therefore, eco-efficiency can provide both environmental and economic benefits through production efficiency.\n\nAlthough social resource is argued as an inessential part in SRM (\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal that discusses various aspects of environmental impact assessments and sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L.
