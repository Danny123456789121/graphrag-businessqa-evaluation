Therefore, we excluded Zhang et al.’s (2009) study from our database.\n\nBased on our multipronged screening process, the ultimate data of our meta-analysis contains 31,773 firm samples from 28 primary studies published from 2001 to 2015, yielding a total of 89 effect sizes. As Chapple and Moon (2005) stated, a great deal of research has been conducted on CSR in Western countries but relatively little focuses on Asia. Christmann and Taylor’s (2001) research was the earliest study that we found. In addition, sample sizes ranged from 86 (Wang et al., 2011) to 10,346 (Sheng, 2013) with an average sample size of 1,134. Ten appeared in JBE, three in AMJ, two in JIBS, one in JOM, and the rest from other journals. Appendix A lists the full details of studies included in our meta-analysis. All articles included in our meta-analysis are also identified in References with an asterisk indicator.\n\n# Measures\n\nCSR and its sister concept—corporate social performance—have been measured in surveys or social reports (i.e., company self-reports and objective data) (Luo, 2006; Scholtens & Kang, 2012; Zhang et al., 2009; Zhu & Sarkis, 2004), KLD ratings (Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co.; Wang et al., 2011), and other methods (Wood, 2010). Following Baughn et al. (2007), we classified CSR as social and environmental CSR. Social CSR is closely related to corporate philanthropy, humanization, and other social practices; environmental CSR focuses on green management, environmental protection, and energy conservation (Orlitzky et al., 2003). We could not classify CSR definitions in studies that adopted multiple CSR definitions, so we excluded them from our subgroup analyses (n = 16). In general, CSR measurement in this research is theoretically driven and consistent with previous studies. We also classified business performance as financial (financial indicators and market indicators) and operational (competitive indicators and social indicators). Table 1 shows details.\n\nDrawing on Ellis (2005), we classified economic development as developed or developing. The most common criteria for evaluating development is to look at gross domestic product (GDP), per capita income, level of industrialization, the amount of widespread infrastructure, and general standard of living. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports the “World Economic Outlook” and provides the classification of advanced economies and developing economies each year. According to the classification of IMF, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are generally regarded as developed Asian economies. In contrast, most parts of Asia, such as People’s Republic of China are regarded as developing economies. After checking statistical data from 2001 to 2014, we found the classification of IMF is stable and unchanged.\n\nPr (a) is the relative observed agreement among raters; Pr (e) is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement, using the observed data to calculate the probabilities of each observer randomly saying each category.\n\nThe number (31,773) refers to the total number of firms across the 28 studies.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nIt is noteworthy that given the time span, there are no countries that make the transition from “developing” to “developed.” Following Beurden and Gossling (2008), we classified industries as manufacturing and service industries. Studies with samples from multiple industry settings (n = 19) were excluded from the comparison between manufacturing and service industries. Following Fang et al.’s (2015) definition of SMEs, we coded firm size based on the number of employees in each sample: small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 500 employees and large-scale enterprises (non-SMEs) with more than 500 employees. We contacted 22 authors of relevant papers to ask for firm size if the article failed to provide the information. We excluded studies that included samples from mixed or unknown firm size (n = 21) during the comparison. Drawing on previous studies, we classified organizational form as either private firms or public firms (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2012). Private firms are run by private individuals or groups, usually for profit, and are not controlled by the state. By contrast, public firms are limited liability firms that offer securities (stock/shares, bonds/loans, etc.) to the general public, typically through a stock exchange. They often receive more stakeholder attention (Caves & Christensen, 1980). We excluded studies that included samples from mixed or unknown organizational forms during the comparison (n = 11).\n\n# Meta-analysis procedure\n\nWe used CMA 2.0 and applied Hendges and Olkin’s (1985) meta-analysis procedures, including calculating weighted mean correlations and 95 % confidence intervals (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001), to analyze the initial data and test proposed hypotheses. Zero-order correlations between CSR and business performance were calculated from each article and then corrected for the measurement error. We adopted Pearson product-moment correlation (r) in our meta-analysis because it is a widely used effect size statistic with scale free in management studies (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Several studies were found to report correlations linking CSR with various performance components (e.g., both return on assets and return on equity for financial performance). Following Ellis’s (2006) method, we averaged the correlations across them within each study to arrive at a mean performance score\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Zhang is a researcher who co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR and firm samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REZAEE<|>PERSON<|>Rezaee is a researcher who co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR and firm samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHU<|>PERSON<|>Zhu is a researcher who co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR and firm samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUE<|>PERSON<|>Yue is a researcher who co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR and firm samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPPLE AND MOON<|>PERSON<|>Chapple and Moon conducted research on CSR, focusing on Western countries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTMANN AND TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Christmann and Taylor conducted early research on CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WANG<|>PERSON<|>Wang is a researcher who co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR and firm samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHENG<|>PERSON<|>Sheng is a researcher who co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR and firm samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINDER, LYDENBERG, DOMINI & CO.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>KLD ratings is an organization that provides ratings related to corporate social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The IMF is an organization that reports on the World Economic Outlook and classifies economies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA<|>GEO<|>Asia is a continent where the studies on CSR are focused, with varying levels of economic development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is regarded as a developing economy in Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is regarded as a developed economy in Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>South Korea is regarded as a developed economy in Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIWAN<|>GEO<|>Taiwan is regarded as a developed economy in Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that encompasses various practices and measures taken by firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Performance is a sister concept to CSR, focusing on social and environmental impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>The meta-analysis procedure is a research method used to analyze data from multiple studies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHANG<|>REZAEE<|>Zhang and Rezaee co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHANG<|>ZHU<|>Zhang and Zhu co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHANG<|>YUE<|>Zhang and Yue co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHU<|>YUE<|>Zhu and Yue co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REZAEE<|>ZHU<|>Rezaee and Zhu co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REZAEE<|>YUE<|>Rezaee and Yue co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAPPLE AND MOON<|>ASIA<|>Chapple and Moon's research on CSR focuses on Western countries, contrasting with studies in Asia<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTMANN AND TAYLOR<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Christmann and Taylor's research is included in the meta-analysis of CSR studies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG<|>SHENG<|>Wang and Sheng co-authored studies on empirical research related to CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>ASIA<|>The IMF classifies economies in Asia as developed or developing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>JAPAN<|>The IMF classifies Japan as a developed economy<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>The IMF classifies South Korea as a developed economy<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>TAIWAN<|>The IMF classifies Taiwan as a developed economy<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>The IMF classifies the People's Republic of China as a developing economy<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>CSR and Corporate Social Performance are closely related concepts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>CSR<|>The meta-analysis procedure analyzes data related to CSR practices<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
