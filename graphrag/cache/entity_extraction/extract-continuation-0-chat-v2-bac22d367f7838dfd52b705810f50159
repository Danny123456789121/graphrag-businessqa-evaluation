The figure also plots the p-value of the carbon premium (dashed green line) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The units of the alpha are shown on the left vertical axis, whereas the units of the p-value on the right vertical axis. Each alpha is plotted at the midpoint of the rolling window, thus using 18 months of data before this point and 18 months of data after.

The sample period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. The figure also shows the 95% confidence interval of the CAPM-alpha (dotted lines) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The original Dirty portfolio includes eight firms, which during each of the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. The sequence with which the stocks are added to the original portfolio is determined by their carbon allowances: each time the stock with the highest number of carbon allowances not already in the portfolio is added to it. The maximum number of stocks receiving carbon allowances is 24.\n\n|0.25|-Clean Portfolio|0.15|-minus|-alpha of Dirty|0.05| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|-0.05|Number of Stocks in Dirty Portfolio|Number of Stocks in Dirty Portfolio|Number of Stocks in Dirty Portfolio|Number of Stocks in Dirty Portfolio|Number of Stocks in Dirty Portfolio|Number of Stocks in Dirty Portfolio| | | | | |\n|8|8|8|8|8|8|8| | | | | | |\n|10|10|10|10|10|10|10| | | | | | |\n|12|12|12|12|12|12|12| | | | | | |\n|14|\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN UNION ALLOWANCE<|>EVENT<|>The European Union Allowance (EUA) is a carbon credit that allows the holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide, traded in the EU Emissions Trading System.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRTY-MINUS-CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>EVENT<|>The Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio is an investment strategy that compares the performance of 'dirty' stocks, which have higher carbon emissions, against 'clean' stocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPM<|>EVENT<|>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that establishes a linear relationship between the expected return of an asset and its risk, often used in finance to determine the cost of equity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The firms mentioned in the context of the Dirty portfolio are companies that have received carbon emission allowances under the EU ETS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEWY-WEST<|>EVENT<|>Newey-West standard errors are a statistical method used to adjust the standard errors of regression estimates to account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRTY-MINUS-CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>EUROPEAN UNION ALLOWANCE<|>The Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio's performance is influenced by the trading of European Union Allowances, as it includes firms that are part of the EU ETS<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAPM<|>DIRTY-MINUS-CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>The CAPM is used to evaluate the expected returns of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio based on its risk profile<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEWY-WEST<|>CAPM<|>Newey-West standard errors are applied to the CAPM regression to ensure accurate estimation of the model's parameters<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRMS<|>DIRTY-MINUS-CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>The firms are part of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio, which assesses their performance based on carbon emissions<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
