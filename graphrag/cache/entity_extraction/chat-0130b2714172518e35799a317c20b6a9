Improved efficiency via environmental performance lowers costs and increases innovation leading to competitive advantage (Aragon-Correa 1998; Christmann 2000; Judge and Douglas 1998; Klassen and Whybark 1999; Russo and Fouts 1997; Shrivastava 1995). Second, strong environmental performance might be viewed as a measure of organizational and managerial capabilities including a long-term versus short-term perspective, a focus on continuous innovation and reduced organizational risk (Aragon-Correa 1998; Hart 1995; Sharma 2000; Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Shrivastava 1995). Third, firms with strong environmental performance might reap reputational benefits, which result in social legitimacy (Hart 1995), the ability to attract and retain quality employees (Turban and Greening 1997), and\n\nincreased sales (Russo and Fouts 1997). Finally, instrumental stakeholder theory posits that to be successful, firms must meet the needs of diverse stakeholder groups, including environmental, employee, and societal groups (Freeman and Evan 1990; Marcus and Geffen 1998; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).\n\nAlthough most CEP–CFP studies suggest a positive relationship, there are some conceptual arguments and empirical studies which support a negative relationship or suggest no significant relationship (e.g., Fogler and Nutt 1975; Freedman and Jaggi 1986). The traditional economic trade-off argument posits that firms incur large costs to improve environmental performance and that these costs exceed the financial benefits gained from them (e.g., Friedman 1970; Greer and Bruno 1996; Jaffe et al. 1995; Walley and Whitehead 1994). Moreover, by improving environmental performance a firm is simply transferring societal costs to the firm (e.g., Bragdon and Marlin 1972). Thus, this approach suggests that pursuing environmental initiatives may be both unprofitable and inappropriate for organizations.\n\nIn an effort to address this ongoing debate, Orlitzky et al. (2003) meta-analyzed CEP–CFP empirical studies, through 1997, as part of a larger study on corporate social performance. The results of their analysis demonstrate a positive relationship between CEP and CFP, and conclude that, in fact, it does pay to be green. While these results have provided some closure to the debate surrounding the general CEP–CFP relationship, work in this area has continued. In fact, there have been a number of studies which examine the CEP–CFP relationship since Orlitzky’s meta-analysis. Therefore, in an effort to move forward, we extend their analysis here, while expecting similar results in our baseline analysis. We also argue, however, that it is time to move on from this general question to address remaining unanswered questions surrounding the CEP–CFP relationship. We agree with other researchers who have emphasized that, unlike other dimensions of CSP, environmental initiatives may not lead to a cost advantage for all firms under all conditions (Christmann 2000; Russo and Fouts 1997). In answering the call for a contingency perspective on CEP–CFP research, our contribution lies in extending our meta-analysis of CEP–CFP empirical studies to a more fine-grained examination of firm-and industry-level characteristics, types of environmental performance, and methodological issues. In doing so, we hope to provide more clarity and guidance for research and practice, on when it pays to be green.\n\n# Reactive Versus Proactive Environmental Strategies\n\nTypologies of environmental strategies and performance abound. Roome (1992) suggests a five-step progression from “noncompliance” to “leading edge.” Hunt and Auster (1990) also posit five types of environmental approaches ranging from “beginner” to “proactivist.” In the larger domain of corporate social responsibility literature, typologies include reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive approaches (Carroll 1979; Clarkson 1995; Wartick and Cochran 1985). Generally found within each of these typologies is a dichotomy which has been termed compliance versus proactive (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Russo and Fouts 1997), traditional versus modern approaches (Aragon-Correa 1998), conformance versus voluntariness (Sharma 2000), or reactive versus proactive (Henriques and Sadorsky 1999).\n\nFor the purposes of this study, we will use the terms reactive and proactive to represent these two forms of environmental strategies. Reactive strategies are driven by compliance and aims to meet legal requirements (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Sharma 2000) which usually require the use of traditional end-of-pipe methods (Bucholz 1993) such as trapping, storing, or treating emissions (Hart 1995). Reactive environmental approaches generally, although not always, lack significant involvement from top management, do not include employee environmental training and involvement (Henriques and Sadorsky 1999), and as the title would indicate, only “react” to solve problems when they arise (Aragon-Correa 1998).\n\nBy contrast, a proactive environmental approach incorporates environmental issues into corporate business strategy beyond the requirements of government regulation (Buysse and Verbeke 2003) and is focused on preventing problems by dealing with the source (Aragon-Correa 1998). Thus, proactive approaches may involve better “housekeeping”, material substitution, process innovation, redesign of production and service delivery processes, creative problem solving, the adoption of innovative technologies, or collaboration with stakeholders (Hart 1995; Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000).
