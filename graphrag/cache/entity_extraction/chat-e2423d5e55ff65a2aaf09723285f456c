CEO duality\n\nIn the one-tier system, the theoretical necessity for an internal division between executive and non-executive duties on the board of directors arises from the notion that management is mainly guided by the intent to maximize its own profit and wealth on the one hand while shirking responsibility on the other (Ross, 1973; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). In the so-called CEO duality model, in which the chief executive officer (CEO) is also the chair of the board, major conflicts of interest may arise (Tirole, 1986). There are increased risks when companies carry out their own assessments, as the chairperson of the board needs to evaluate situations that are associated with his or her own functions as CEO. Thus, according to stakeholder-agency theory, the CEO duality model should be avoided. At the same time, suitable and effective management advice from the board necessitates their comprehensive knowledge of business strategy. This can be relevant in CSR reporting. Furthermore, the avoidance of the CEO duality model may be attributed to self-impression management in order to attract new stakeholders.\n\nCEO duality is a very common board composition variable in empirical research with mixed results. Negative impacts of CEO duality on CSR reporting are stated by Muttakin and Subramaniam (2015), Li et al. (2010) and Lim et al. (2008). Among others, Jizi et al. (2014) found a positive impact. With regard to the mixed theoretical and empirical research results, the following hypotheses are stated:\n\n- H2a: Absence of CEO duality is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory.\n- H2b: Absence of CEO duality is negatively linked to CSR reporting in line with legitimacy theory.\n\n# 2.2.3. Gender diversity\n\nBy taking gender diversity of boards into account, several arguments concerning CSR reporting can be stressed. For instance, Hillman et al. (2000) state that gender diversity provides various resources that benefit the company in terms of CSR reporting. Thus, the greater efficiency of monitoring activities can be explained by better information processing and a willingness on the part of the management to engage in dialogue (Carter et al., 2010). Many psychological studies confirmed that gender diversity may be connected with a more open mind discussion and creating innovative strategies like CSR reporting (Wood et al., 1985). Research has partly confirmed the positive influence of gender diversity on board effectiveness. Psychological researchers state that female board members are more risk-averse than their male colleagues so that they are more alike to fulfil stakeholders’ interests (Konrad et al., 2008). As CSR reporting contributes to stakeholders’ information needs, women on boards will contribute to an increased awareness of CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory. The predominance of research focusing on gender diversity on boards of directors can be attributed to its comparative simplicity of categorization as well as to the long-running socio-political debate over whether a fixed quota of women on boards should be established by law. The link between gender diversity on CSR reporting can also be negative according to the legitimacy theory. As gender diversity is a very political topic, it could be used as a symbolic strategy of management without any impact on CSR reporting quality. With regard to critical mass theory, the election of one or few female board member may be even ineffective. In view of the huge discussion of gender diversity from an international perspective, current empirical research often includes this board composition variable and finds mixed results. We recognize both positive (e.g. Kilic et al., 2015; Barako & Brown, 2008) and negative (e.g. Handajani et al., 2014) results. A current meta-analysis of former studies found a positive link between gender diversity and CSR performance (Byron & Post, 2016). As the author’s mix CSR performance and CSR reporting studies in their sample, it is not clear whether the positive\n\n# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019\n\n# 2.2.4. Board size\n\nFrom the perspective of stakeholder-agency theory, an appropriate amount of board members seems to be most important to guarantee a good quality of board effectiveness (Jensen, 1993). But large boards can also result in flawed incentives to engage in free-rider behaviour (McConnell & Servaes, 1990). Thus, board size is a controversial corporate governance variable. In line with legitimacy theory, flexibility and dynamism of the decision-making process can be reduced as the number of board members increases (Cheng, 2008). Insufficient critical self-reflection and a lower level of process discussion can be the consequence, thereby resulting in lower board effectiveness (Lipton & Lorsch, 1992). Moreover, monitoring requirements within the board increase along with board size, which requires more resources with respect to time and special experience. Insofar, an “optimal” board size is related to individual firm factors and maybe not the best board composition indicator to influence CSR reporting.\n\nFurthermore, the empirical results on board size are mixed. Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016), Janggu et al. (2014) and Jizi et al. (2014) found a positive impact of board size on CSR reporting. According to Abduh and AlAgeely (2015), among others, board size was negatively related to CSR reporting.
