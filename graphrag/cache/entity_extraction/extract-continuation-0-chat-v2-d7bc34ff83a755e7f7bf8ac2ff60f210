Reputation and greenwashing are calculated on a 1 year window preceding each event. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. The estimation window is ½ 70; 11. The sample is composed of 100 large companies between 2002 and 2010. Data on ESG news are from Covalence EthicalQuote. *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, 1% level respectively.\n\nfirms which claim to be virtuous are more scrutinized by the media and the watchdogs, which could be double-edged.\n\n# Content Analysis\n\nAs expected, the tone of the articles clearly influences the impact of ESG news on firms’ market value (hypotheses #10). We find that articles including quantitative words tend to be associated with larger losses. The impact is also amplified when articles include an economic vocabulary, albeit to a lower extent. The literature has already shown that the content of financial news influences the stock markets (see for example Schumaker and Chen 2009, or Kogan et al. 2013). Our results confirm recent findings (Krueger 2015) highlighting the relevance of content analysis of extra-financial news.\n\n# Out of Sight, Out of Mind?\n\nCultural distance affects the impact of ESG news (hypothesis #11). Previous papers have shown that within a country, investors overweight domestic firms20. Heath and Tversky (1991) explain this phenomenon by an aversion to ambiguity\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOW JONES FACTIVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dow Jones Factiva is a database that provides news and information, including ESG news, which can influence shareholder attention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESG EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>ESG events refer to occurrences related to environmental, social, and governance factors that can impact market reactions and firm reputations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVALENCE ETHICALQUOTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Covalence EthicalQuote is a data provider that offers information on ESG news and its impact on companies' market values.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE COMPANIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The sample consists of 100 large companies analyzed for their market reactions to ESG news between 2002 and 2010.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRM REPUTATION<|>EVENT<|>Firm reputation is a measure of how a company is perceived in terms of its ethical practices and can influence market reactions to ESG news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENWASHING<|>EVENT<|>Greenwashing refers to the practice of companies misleading stakeholders regarding their environmental practices, which can affect their reputation and market value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL DISTANCE<|>EVENT<|>Cultural distance is a concept that describes the differences between cultures, which can influence investors' perceptions and reactions to ESG news.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOW JONES FACTIVA<|>ESG EVENTS<|>Dow Jones Factiva reports on ESG events, which can affect shareholder attention and market reactions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVALENCE ETHICALQUOTE<|>LARGE COMPANIES<|>Covalence EthicalQuote provides data on large companies' ESG news and its impact on their market value<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRM REPUTATION<|>GREENWASHING<|>Firm reputation can be negatively impacted by accusations of greenwashing, affecting market reactions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL DISTANCE<|>ESG EVENTS<|>Cultural distance can affect how investors react to ESG events, particularly in domestic versus foreign contexts<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
