Scanning might be broad, but also rather vague, since breadth comes at the expense of detailed information search (Das & Teng, 1999). With their complex and broad frame, managers may perceive too many issues and aspects as potentially relevant (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Owing to their limited cognitive capacities (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), decision makers cannot collect, process, and store detailed information on a wide range of sustainability aspects, as well as on the complex interconnections between them; hence, uncertainties will remain. While decision makers can cope with tensions and uncertainties through paradoxical thinking, their scanning will remain inconclusive. Overall, we expect that the less their cognitive frame is focused on alignment, the wider the variety of aspects of numerous sustainability issues managers will notice but the less they will be able to collect detailed information on the various aspects of these issues and their interrelations (see Figure 2).\n\n# Proposition 1b:\n\nThe more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a wide range of aspects of numerous sustainability issues based on broad browsing, but with a lack of detailed information.\n\nSince cognitive frames are acquired and learned through a manager’s career history (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Porac & Thomas, 2002), we expect that the functional background of decision makers will influence their scanning of strategic issues (Beyer et al., 1997; Sutcliffe & Huber, 1998; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988). According to previous research, functional background influences the breadth and depth of scanning, because managers with different functional backgrounds favor different search modes (Beyer et al., 1997). Managers with a background in internally oriented functions, such as engineering, accounting, and finance, have the tendency to be more task oriented and to focus more on internal efficiency (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), as well as on unidimensional and clearly structured outcomes (Thomas & Simerly, 1994). They are thus more likely to perform focused search in a structured and formalized manner (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). Managers from externally oriented functions, such as marketing, research, and product development (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), are more often exposed to situations where stakeholder demands are in conflict (Maon et al., 2008). Hence, they tend to be “more adept at recognizing the multiple demands of their stakeholders [and the] competing interests of their constituents” (Thomas & Simerly, 1994: 962). These managers are more familiar with collecting information through broad and less structured browsing (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). We therefore expect that managers with a background in externally oriented functions will tend to scan more broadly but in less detail, while those with an internally oriented functional background will tend to scan less broadly but in more detail (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 2).\n\n# Proposition 2a:\n\nDecision makers with a background in externally oriented functions will scan more broadly but with less detail, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on scanning.\n\n# Academy of Management Review\n\n# Proposition 2b\n\nDecision makers with a background in internally oriented functions will scan less broadly but with more detail, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on scanning.\n\nManagers’ perceptions of ambiguous cues from the organizational context are not only constrained by their cognitive capacities and personal characteristics but also by situational factors. When dealing with conflicting information and disparate stakeholder interests, managers usually do so under time pressure and resource limitations (Mann & Tan, 1993). Hence, scholars often argue that a greater availability of resources will enhance managers’ ability to collect more detailed and broader information on sustainability issues, since collecting and processing information on a broad range of sustainability issues is time consuming and costly (Bansal, 2005; Bowen, 2002; Sharma, 2000). Additional time and resources “can facilitate search activity which is not necessarily problem-related” (Bowen, 2002: 311) and can provide the latitude to perform searches on aspects and issues that may not have an immediate payoff (Levinthal & March, 1981). However, we argue that the effect of resource availability on managerial scanning of sustainability issues will not be categorical. The breadth of scanning by managers with a business case frame is not primarily limited by a lack of time or resources but, rather, by the focus of the frame content on economic attributes and by its alignment structure. Even with abundant resources, these managers are not likely to perform a broader search. They will still fail to notice information on sustainability issues that is presented in nonfinancial, qualitative terms and that has an ambiguous relation to financial outcomes. Conversely, the information search of managers with a paradoxical frame is limited by their capacity to collect and process detailed information on a broad range of sustainability issues. Part of this limitation will be due to their limited cognitive capacities to handle large amounts of information (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). However, the availability of additional time and resources will allow these managers to collect more detailed information on the broad range of sustainability issues they have noticed. We therefore suggest the following relation between resource availability and scanning (see the dotted curve in Figure 2).\n\n# Proposition 3\n\nThe availability of additional time and resources will enable decision\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an environmental NGO dedicated to biodiversity and collecting expert opinions on its relevance for various organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLCIM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Holcim is a company referenced in the context of biodiversity and sustainability, as studied by IUCN.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Academy of Management Review is a scholarly journal that publishes research on management, including studies on decision-making and sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAS & TENG<|>PERSON<|>Das and Teng are researchers referenced in the context of sustainability and decision-making frameworks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIESLER & SPROULL<|>PERSON<|>Kiesler and Sproull are researchers whose work is cited regarding cognitive capacities and information processing in decision-making.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAMBRICK & MASON<|>PERSON<|>Hambrick and Mason are researchers referenced for their theories on managerial focus and decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANSAL<|>PERSON<|>Bansal is a researcher mentioned in the context of resource availability and its impact on managerial scanning of sustainability issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWEN<|>PERSON<|>Bowen is a researcher cited for insights on resource availability and its effects on information search activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARMA<|>PERSON<|>Sharma is a researcher referenced in relation to sustainability issues and managerial decision-making.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE<|>HOLCIM<|>IUCN is collecting expert opinions on the relevance of biodiversity for Holcim<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAS & TENG<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>Das and Teng's research is published in the Academy of Management Review, contributing to the understanding of sustainability dimensions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIESLER & SPROULL<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>Kiesler and Sproull's work on cognitive capacities is discussed in the Academy of Management Review<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAMBRICK & MASON<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>Hambrick and Mason's theories on managerial focus are featured in the Academy of Management Review<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANSAL<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>Bansal's research on resource availability is published in the Academy of Management Review<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOWEN<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>Bowen's insights on resource availability and information search are discussed in the Academy of Management Review<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARMA<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW<|>Sharma's work on sustainability issues is featured in the Academy of Management Review<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
