Introduction\n\nWe examine to what extent temperature shocks affect the cost of equity. If temperature fluctuations are uncertain and systematically affect cash flows, temperature shocks could represent a priced Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) risk factor, resulting in increases in expected returns. Higher expected returns mean a higher cost of capital to firms, which can have a profound and adverse impact on economic growth (Henry, 2003). To study empirically whether temperature shocks are a priced APT factor, we follow the empirical asset-pricing literature (e.g. Vassalou, 2003; Kapadia, 2011). We find that the average cost of equity capital is 0.22.\n\n1 Our investigation is motivated by substantial uncertainty in temperature variation, which can be illustrated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s widely quoted estimates for the increase in the global mean temperature. IPCC’s range for the possible increase of global mean surface temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) relative to the 1986–2005 period is vast: from 0.3°C to 4.8°C (IPCC, 2014). Kamstra, Kramer and Levi (2003) examine how temperature affects human mood and investor behavior, but not from the climate change perspective. Fankhauser and Tol (2005) study the impact of climate change on capital accumulation, but not from the cost-of-capital perspective. Brunner (2002) analyzes\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RONALD BALVERS<|>PERSON<|>Ronald Balvers is an author affiliated with the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University, contributing to research on the cost of equity capital and climate change perceptions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DING DU<|>PERSON<|>Ding Du is an author affiliated with the W.
