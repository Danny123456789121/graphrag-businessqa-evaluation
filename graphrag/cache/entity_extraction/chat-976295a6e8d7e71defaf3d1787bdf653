Lenders can use generative AI to analyze loan textual assessments and provide extended information on whether to lend to a borrower. Future research could attempt to compare generative AI default predictions for crowdfunding with actual default risk based on disclosed information; generative AI could also be used to assess the quality culture of crowdfunding projects. Generative AI can also produce detailed loan applicant-friendly explanations for rejection, maintain good customer relationships, and improve future application processes. In the accounting and auditing domains, generative AI can automatically generate coherent, informative, and well-structured financial reports based on historical data, including balance sheets, income statements, and taxation documents. This process could significantly reduce the operational risks of manual errors. In addition, generative AI can produce synthetic cases of fraudulent transactions or activities for fraud detection that can help augment algorithms and more efficiently differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent patterns.\n\nIn this section, we use churn risk prediction as an example of risk management using a scenario where a customer leaves a very negative review on a shopping platform.
