Therefore, one potential reason for the variation of the study results may refer to the variety of different events such as environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996), product- and process-driven environmental initiatives (Gilley et al. 2000), inclusion and exclusion from the DJSI (Consolandi et al. 2009), or membership in voluntary environmental initiatives (Keele and DeHart 2011). While it would have been interesting to explore whether the variation of the study findings might be attributed to the qualitative differences of the particular events, the very diversity of CEP-related events and, associated therewith, the small number of sufficiently similar studies did not allow constructing meaningful subgroups for contrasting the effect sizes in this regard.\n\nTo conclude, this study adds to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by providing meta-analytic evidence for positive market reactions to positive CEP-related events and negative market reactions to negative CEP-related events. Thus, it indicates that CEP-related events affect the market’s estimates of future cash flow. Furthermore, the meta-analytic results demonstrate that the market reaction is asymmetric in that the reaction is stronger for negative events than for positive events. Finally, the analyses indicate the presence of moderation effects that could not sufficiently be explained by the subgroup analyses that were feasible on the grounds of the available data. Thus, this study entails the need for further research on this topic.\n\n# References\n\nReferences marked with an asterisk indicate studies included in the meta-analysis\n\n- Aguinis, H., Dalton, D.
