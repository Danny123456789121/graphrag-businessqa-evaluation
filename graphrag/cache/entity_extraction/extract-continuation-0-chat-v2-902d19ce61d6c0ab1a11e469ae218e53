A diverse and growing body of empirical findings has emerged identifying a wide variety of empirical mechanisms linking CSR to CFP. One of the most persistent conceptual critiques on CSR involved its lack of theoretical foundations (Ullmann, 1985), resulting in a poorly specified construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995) that has highly permeable boundaries (Lockett, Moon, & Visser, 2006). This has led some scholars to claim that CSR hardly meets even the most basic requirements for explanatory concepts in social science (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). Although several attempts at conceptual clarification were made (Clarkson, 1995; Swanson, 1995; Windsor, 2006), scholars seem to have accepted that CSR is better conceived of as an umbrella term rather than a well-defined theoretical concept (Gond & Crane, 2010). But as empirical research on CSR and on the CSR-CFP relationship continues to proliferate, the absence of a well-defined theoretical concept increasingly hinders the development of the field (Lockett et al.).\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nal., 2006; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006; Pfeffer, 1993), since a minimal degree of consensus regarding the defining features of a concept is required for scholars to effectively engage with each other to advance common knowledge (Kuhn, 1962; Suddaby, 2010).\n\nWithin the general field of CSR research, we focus specifically on the stream of research investigating the CSR-CFP relationship in order to isolate and develop the concept of “Strategic CSR”. Following Goertz’ (2006) causal approach to explanatory concepts in social science, we develop a three-level conceptual structure of the concept of Strategic CSR in an effort to identify its causally most relevant properties for explaining financial performance differentials between firms.\n\nWe review the empirical CSR-CFP literature, and ask three questions about the current state of research. First, what do we currently know about how CSR affects firm financial outcomes? Specifically, what are the most important empirical mechanisms through which the variety of CSR activities investigated in the literature affect CFP? Second, does our current knowledge about how CSR activities affect CFP ‘exhaust’ the overall CSR-CFP relationship, that is, is the relationship between CSR and CFP fully explained (i.e. fully mediated) by the four empirical mechanisms that we identify in this study? Third, based on the findings of this study, what potentially fruitful avenues can we suggest for future research on (Strategic) CSR?\n\nWe answer these questions using advanced meta-analytic techniques on the empirical evidence accumulated over five decades of empirical CSR-CFP research. Based on a review of the literature, we identify four theoretical mechanisms for which empirical evidence is sufficiently available. We then use meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM: Bergh, Aguinis, Heavey, Ketchen, Boyd, Su, Lau, & Joo, 2016) on a combined sample of 402,863 firm-year observations retrieved from 344 empirical studies to provide a simultaneous meta-analytic test of the four empirical mechanisms identified.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nWe seek to make three contributions to the CSR literature. First, we synthesize the growing and increasingly fragmented body of research on the relationship between CSR and CFP. We document four mechanisms through which CSR activities may contribute to the financial bottom line of firms: firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, risk mitigation, and innovation capacity. Second, we rely on these four mechanisms to theoretically develop the concept of Strategic CSR by defining it in terms of its causally most relevant attributes in explaining CFP. By developing an evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR that can be isolated and carved out from the conceptual domain of CSR more generally, we respond to the long-heard call for better-specified concepts in CSR research around which CSR researchers may unite and contribute to the development of a shared paradigm (Gond & Crane, 2010; Jones, 1995; Lockett et al., 2006). Third, our findings serve as a guide for future CSR-CFP research, both in terms of establishing what we already know and in identifying possible avenues for innovative research contributions still to be made.\n\n# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe concept of CSR initially developed in the context of a normative debate, as much of the early CSR literature evolved around the normative question whether firms have an obligation to promote social betterment over and above their economic and legal obligations (Carroll, 1999; Frederick, 1994; Matten, Crane, & Chapple, 2003). In this debate, CSR was mostly residually conceptualized as socially valuable firm activities not required by law or shareholder interests (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), which explains the coarse and over-inclusive meaning that the concept subsequently acquired in the literature (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). The move to position CSR as a positive explanatory concept emerged from one particular line of argument in this debate; that CSR activities can be strategically justified because, next to promoting socially beneficial outcomes, they will also positively affect CFP.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
