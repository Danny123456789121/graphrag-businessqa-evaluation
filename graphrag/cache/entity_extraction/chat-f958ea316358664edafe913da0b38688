Drawing on a hybrid theoretical framework (combining the theoretical reasoning of the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) with instrumental stakeholder and slack resources arguments), we address the apparent lack of consensus by meta-analytically integrating the findings of 149 studies. We pay particular attention to two highly material issues: the direction of causality and the multidimensionality of the focal constructs. Meta-analytic results indicate that there is a positive and partially bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP. In addition, our findings suggest that the relationship is stronger when the strategic approach underlying CEP is proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, we reveal moderation effects of methodological artifacts, which may provide explanations for the inconsistency of the results of previous studies. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and outline avenues for further research.\n\n# Introduction\n\n“While the question of whether it pays to be green has probably generated more research pages than any other single question, the answer remains unresolved” (Hoffman & Bansal, 2012, p. 14).\n\n“Science advances when scholars reach consensus about the conclusions offered by a body of evidence, and meta-analysis is our best methodology for reaching consensus” (Combs, Ketchen, Crook, & Roth, 2011, p. 194).\n\nThe relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) constitutes one of the most puzzling phenomena pertaining to research on organizations and the natural environment. Insofar as scholars have tackled environmental issues, the discovery of the link between CEP and CFP has evolved into something similar to finding the “holy grail” (Boons & Wagner, 2009; Peloza, 2009). Over the last four decades, myriad studies have sought to identify the relationship between these performance constructs. In this context, one of the most fundamental issues shaping research on the focal relationship refers to the direction of causality (i.e., whether CEP influences CFP, whether CFP influences CEP, or whether there is a bidirectional relationship) (e.g., Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; Molina-Azorín, Claver-Cortés, López-Gamero, & Tarí, 2009; Preston & O’Bannon, 1997). Furthermore, in recent years, several scholars (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Delmas, Hoffmann, & Kuss, 2011; Etzion, 2007; Orlitzky, Siegel, & Waldman, 2011) have emphasized the need to extend the scope of analysis by exploring the determinants, potential contingency factors, and boundary conditions under which CEP and CFP are related. In other words, research has been called upon to adopt a more sophisticated view and to “look beneath the surface” (Delmas et al., 2011, p. 117) in order to get a better understanding of the mechanisms connecting both performance constructs.\n\nDespite the enormous number of publications concerned with the relationship between CEP and CFP, the overall picture remains vague. While some studies have provided evidence of a positive relationship (e.g., Clarkson, Li, Richardson, & Vasvari, 2011; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; King & Lenox, 2001; Konar & Cohen, 2001; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Wagner & Schaltegger, 2004), others have sup-\n\n© 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\n0263-2373/$ - see front matter © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2013.12.004\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al.

Several explanations for the apparent inconsistency have been proposed, involving both methodological and theoretical issues (Ruf, Muralidhar, Brown, Janney, & Paul, 2001). These explanations address different aspects, describing (1) the lack of a sound theoretical foundation (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
