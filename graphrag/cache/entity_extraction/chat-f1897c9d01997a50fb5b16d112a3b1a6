The bottom panels plot the firms’ E score over time, as well as their emission intensity. NIBE Industrier AB develops solutions for smart heating and intelligent control in industry and infrastructure. International Airlines Group is the largest airline group globally. The greenness and transparency indicator for the two companies differs by three orders of magnitude. For NIBE Industrier AB, the quality and quantity of disclosures have improved over time, together with a slightly decreasing emission intensity, both resulting in an increasing value for the greenness and transparency indicator over time. International Airlines Group attained an E score in 2011 which was comparable to that of NIBE Industrier AB in 2009. However, International Airlines Group’s disclosures only marginally improved over time, if at all. With respect to emissions, they are obviously incomparably larger for airlines than for many other companies.\n\n31\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n# NIBE Industrier AB\n\n| |2009|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017| | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Score|100|90|80|70|60|50|40|30|20|10|0|\n|Emissions Intensity|5|4.5|4|3.5|3|2.5|2|1.5|1|0.5| |\n\nFigure 2: Greenness and transparency indicator GN IBE,y , E score and emissions intensity in ranked and row values, of the NIBE Industrier AB.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\n# International Airlines Group\n\n| |2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Emissions Intensity|0|100|200|300|400|500|600|\n|GIntAir,y|0|10|20|30|40|50|60|\n|E Score|0|70|80|90|100|110|120|\n\nFigure 3: Greenness and transparency indicator GIntAir,y, E score and emissions intensity in ranked and raw values, of the International Airlines Group.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=345\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
