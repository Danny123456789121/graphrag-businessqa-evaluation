Second, we estimated a range of potential costs for this technology when it is first introduced, and then declining over time, based on historical precedents.\n\nThe modeled scenarios create a time range for the potential pace of automating current work activities. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.\n\n# Exhibit\n\nOur analysis assesses the potential for technical automation across some 2,100 activities and 18 capabilities.\n\n|~850 occupations|~2,100 activities assessed|Capability requirements|\n|---|---|---|\n|Examples|across all occupations| |\n|Retail|Example: Retail activities|Sensory|\n|salespeople|• Answer questions about products and services|• Sensory perception|\n| |• Greet customers|• Fine motor skills and dexterity|\n| |• Clean and maintain work areas|• Gross motor skills|\n|Health|• Demonstrate product features|Cognitive|\n|practitioners|• Process sales and transactions|• Retrieving information|\n| | |• Recognizing known patterns and categories (supervised learning)|\n| | |• Generating novel patterns and categories|\n| | |• Logical reasoning and problem solving|\n|Food and beverage| |Natural-language processing|\n|service workers| |• Understanding natural language|\n| | |• Generating natural language|\n|Teachers| |Social|\n| | |• Social and emotional sensing|\n| | |• Social and emotional reasoning|\n| | |• Social and emotional output|\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\n34 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\n# Accelerating the technical potential to transform knowledge work\n\nBased on developments in generative AI, technology performance is now expected to match median human performance and reach top quartile human performance earlier than previously estimated across a wide range of capabilities (Exhibit 6). For example, MGI previously identified 2027 as the earliest year when median human performance for natural-language understanding might be achieved in technology, but in this new analysis, the corresponding point is 2023.\n\n# Exhibit 6\n\nAs a result of generative AI, experts assess that technology could achieve human-level performance in some technical capabilities sooner than previously thought.\n\n|Technical capabilities, level of human performance achievable by technology|Estimates post-recent generative AI developments (2023)¹|Median|Top quartile|Line represents range of expert estimates|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Estimates pre-generative AI (2017)¹|Median|Top quartile| | |\n|Coordination with multiple agents| | | | |\n|Creativity| | | | |\n|Logical reasoning and problem solving| | | | |\n|Natural-language generation| | | | |\n|Natural-language understanding| | | | |\n|Output articulation and presentation| | | | |\n|Generating novel patterns and categories| | | | |\n|Sensory perception| | | | |\n|Social and emotional output| | | | |\n|Social and emotional reasoning| | | | |\n|Social and emotional sensing| | | | |\n\n¹Comparison made on the business-related tasks required from human workers.

The technical potential curve is quite steep because of the acceleration in generative AI’s natural-language capabilities (Exhibit 7).\n\nInterestingly, the range of times between the early and late scenarios has compressed compared with the expert assessments in 2017, reflecting a greater confidence that higher levels of technological capabilities will arrive by certain time periods.\n\n# Exhibit 7\n\nThe advent of generative AI has pulled forward the potential for technical automation.\n\n| |Technical automation potentials by scenario, %| | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|100|Updated early scenario2 including generative AI|Updated late scenario2 including generative AI| |\n| |90|2017 early scenario2|2017 late scenario2|\n| |80|Time spent on current work activities| |\n| | |70| |\n| | |60| |\n| |50| | |\n| |2020 2030 2040 2050 2060| | |\n\n1Includes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world. 2017 estimates are based on the activity and occupation mix from 2016. Scenarios including generative AI are based on the 2021 activity and occupation mix. Early and late scenarios reflect the ranges provided by experts (see Exhibit 6).\n\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nAdoption lags behind technical automation potential. Our analysis of adoption scenarios accounts for the time required to integrate technological capabilities into solutions that can automate individual work activities; the cost of these technologies compared with that of human labor in different occupations and countries around the world; and the time it has taken for technologies to diffuse across the economy. With the acceleration in technical automation potential that generative AI enables, our scenarios for automation adoption have correspondingly accelerated. These scenarios encompass a wide range of outcomes, given that the pace at which solutions will be developed and adopted will vary based on decisions that will be made on investments.\n\ndeployment, and regulation, among other factors.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that provides insights and analysis on various industries, including technology and automation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The McKinsey Global Institute is the research arm of McKinsey & Company, focusing on economic and business trends.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>EVENT<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can generate text, images, and other content, significantly impacting productivity and automation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TECHNICAL AUTOMATION<|>EVENT<|>Technical automation involves the use of technology to automate tasks and processes that were previously performed by humans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023<|>EVENT<|>The year 2023 is significant as it marks the anticipated achievement of human-level performance in certain technical capabilities due to advancements in generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2027<|>EVENT<|>The year 2027 was previously identified as the earliest year for achieving median human performance in natural-language understanding before being revised to 2023.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCCUPATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Occupations refer to various job roles that may be impacted by automation and technological advancements, with assessments made on their potential for automation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPABILITIES<|>EVENT<|>Capabilities refer to the skills and functions that technology can perform, which are being evaluated for their potential to be automated.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY & COMPANY<|>MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE<|>McKinsey Global Institute is the research arm of McKinsey & Company, providing analysis and insights on economic trends<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>TECHNICAL AUTOMATION<|>Generative AI is a key driver of technical automation, enabling faster and more efficient automation of tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2023<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The advancements in generative AI are expected to lead to significant changes in productivity and automation by the year 2023<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2027<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The revision of the timeline from 2027 to 2023 for achieving human-level performance in natural-language understanding highlights the impact of generative AI<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCCUPATIONS<|>TECHNICAL AUTOMATION<|>Occupations are being assessed for their potential to be automated through technical automation technologies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAPABILITIES<|>TECHNICAL AUTOMATION<|>Capabilities are the skills that technology can perform, which are crucial for understanding the potential of technical automation<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
