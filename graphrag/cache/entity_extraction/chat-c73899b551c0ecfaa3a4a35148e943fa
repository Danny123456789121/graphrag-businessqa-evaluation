We define a priced ‘greenness and transparency’ factor based on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures. Based on this factor, we offer a tool to assess the exposure of a portfolio to the risk associated with the low-carbon transition, and hedge against it. We estimate that in a stressed scenario where greener and more transparent firms very much outperform brown stocks, there would be losses at the global level, including for European large banks, should investors fail to price climate-transition risks. These results call for the introduction of climate stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n\n# Keywords\n\nClimate risk, environmental disclosure, factor models, asset pricing, stress test.\n\n# J.E.L. classification\n\nG01; G11; G12; Q01.\n\n∗Disclaimer: The content of this article does not necessarily reflect the official opinion of the European Commission.

In particular, it would be hard to pin down the net present value of activities aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as those directed to broader environmental objectives such as the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling, pollution prevention and control, and the protection of healthy ecosystems.2 At the same time, the consequences of a transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient and circular economy, or lack thereof, are also largely uncertain. Hence, these issues have to be addressed as aspects of long-run risk. The contribution of this paper is to measure the added value of greener economic activities in terms of market excess returns. To do so, we first show that indeed, the European market prices climate risk in the form of a greenness and environmental transparency factor, in the context of a standard asset pricing model. Second, we estimate that the market associates a negative risk premium, which we label Greenium, to more environmentally friendly and transparent firms.\n\nWe identify the greenness and transparency factor based on a precise definition. In particular, we first construct portfolios characterized by a different shade of green and a different degree of environmental transparency. This is based on firm-level information on greenhouse gas (GHG) or CO2 emissions, combined with a measure of the completeness of firms’ environmental disclosures, to yield a synthetic greenness and transparency index for each stock. Companies which disclose a lower emission intensity, and are very transparent, attain the highest scores and are included in a greener and more transparent portfolio. The most straightforward example of greener companies would be those with a large share of their turnover in green economic sectors, e.g. renewable energy. Conversely, companies which do not disclose information on their environmental performance are labeled as non-transparent. Among these nontransparent companies, those active in carbon-intensive sectors, e.g. companies operating coal power plants, are included in a brown portfolio. The greenness and transparency factor is constructed based on 942 companies listed on the STOXX Europe Total Market Index.\n\nBy relying on company-level disclosures and factoring-in their transparency, we try to tackle the issue of green-washing, which is likely to be the reason why the literature has so far failed to find a consensus on the existence of a priced green\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
