Managers in East Asia should focus on environmental CSR because it is more important than social CSR in the East Asian context. However, CSR is not a panacea for improving business performance because it is contextually relied. For instance, our research findings suggest SMEs in developing Asian countries, especially private firms, should consider CSR to acquire competitive advantage. In addition, with the development of globalization, more and more multinational companies (MNCs) prefer to enter East Asia markets. Therefore, the unique and important role of CSR in East Asia is crucial for MNCs. For instance, Carrefour, Tesco, and other Western companies need to realize the fact that environmental CSR is more important in East Asia.\n\n# Limitations and future research directions\n\nThis meta-analytic study has several limitations that must be considered. First, CSR has many definitions capturing, for example, the ethic aspect, stakeholder dimension, economic dimension, and voluntary dimension, and each type of CSR may have.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn recent years, scholars have turned their attention to corporate social responsibility in East Asia and have produced a cumulating yet fragmented body of empirical studies. The time is therefore appropriate to focus, review, and explore the CSR–business performance relationship in East Asian contexts by meta-analysis. Our meta-analytic review of 28 East Asian-based empirical studies, together with extensive discussions and future research suggestions, may furnish a reference for further theory development and empirical analysis in this field. We find that CSR continues to play a prominent role in facilitating business performance, especially operational performance. Interestingly, CSR may have stronger implications for small, privately owned businesses in the developing parts of East Asia such as China. We hope our study will inspire future research on CSR in East Asia.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\n|Category of CSR|Multiple|CSR|Multiple|CSR|Multiple|Multiple|Multiple|Multiple|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Measurement of CSR|Self-report|Self-report|Self-report|Archival|Self-report|Self-report|Self-report|Archival|\n|Public vs. private|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Public|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Public|\n|Firm size: Large firms vs. SMEs|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|SMEs|\n|Industry type: Manufacturing vs. services|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Mixed|Service|\n|Economic development: Developing vs. Developed|Developing|Developed|Developed|Developing|Developing|Developed|Developing|Developing|\n|Country|Taiwan|China|China|Korea|China|China|China|Japan|\n|Sample size|1841|222|5,660|2,560|10,346|295|153|314|\n| |101|472|400|254|221|692|126|118|\n\n# Publication\n\n2015 Journal of Business Research\n\nPacific-Basin Finance Journal\n\nMarketing and Logistics\n\nJournal of Business Ethics\n\nManagement Science and Organization Science\n\nAsia Pacific Journal of Business Studies\n\nIncluded in the Meta-analysis, 2001 Doctoral dissertation Quality and Quantity\n\nAustralian Journal of Engineering\n\n# Study\n\nNo.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n# M.
