This has made the results debatable, and consequently no consensus has been reached. In response, some authors such as Orlitzky et al. (2003) attempted to resolve the issue using meta-analyses of results.\n\nIn view of the above, this paper is aimed towards contributing to the arrival of a possible consensus on this issue. In reaching towards the aim we have employed a sub-group meta-analysis of the results of the studies identiﬁed by Orlitzky et al. (2003). More speciﬁcally, we have conducted a number of meta-analyses of the results of studies by date of publication, sample size and statistical methodology. The aim was to ﬁnd out whether the differences in methodologies and statistical method have made any contribution to the impasse relating to the nexus between CSR and ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms.\n\n# 4. Methodology\n\nA meta-analysis is used as a method of investigation for this research. Meta-analysis is an advanced technique used to combine the results of a number of studies in order to gain a better overall picture of the underlying relationships between the variable of interest in relation to a particular study. In the past, researchers simply carried out a textual analysis of studies, or applied a simple vote-counting procedure in an attempt to determine the overall nature of the relationship(s). Glass (1976) published one of the ﬁrst meta-analysis procedures for combining effect sizes in a statistically appropriate manner (Hunter et al., 1982). Meta-analysis has since been used in many studies and by now it has emerged as a useful statistical technique in terms of combining the results of a number of studies; especially in clinical trials (for example, see www.cochrane.org). Similar systematic reviews in the ﬁelds of education, crime and justice and social welfare are published by the Campbell Collaboration (see www.campbellcollaboration.org).\n\nFor the purpose of this paper we have based our meta-analysis on 51 of the papers included in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis. This meta analysis is the latest study in this particular area. In their abstract, Orlitzky et al. (2003) referred to 51 papers and an overall positive effect of CSR on CFP, although the effect was moderated by the deﬁnitions of CSR and CFP used in each paper. The authors provided year of publication, effect size and sample size for the 51 papers used in their original analysis. These 51 papers form the basis of our analysis for the current paper. We have decided to conﬁne our analysis to the 51 papers in order to maintain consistency with the previous work as well as to be able to compare some of the results of our meta-analysis with those of prior studies. This means that this paper will speciﬁcally focus on deﬁnitions of corporate ﬁnancial performance as used by the 51 papers that have been included in this meta-analysis ranging from return on asset (ROA) to return on investment (ROI).\n\nAs can be seen in Table I, many of the studies included in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis provided more than one effect size. This can be due to multiple measures of CSR and CFP, or other ways of subdividing the data. For example Davidson and Worrell (1992) report results for several different types of product recall. Herremans et al. (1993) report results across a number of years. Simerly (1994) uses seven different measures of CFP and O’Neill et al. (1989) use four different measures of CSR. In some cases it even turned out that some of the effect sizes were positive and some were negative. If this occurred, then the entry in column 4 of Table I is recorded as ‘‘variable’’. This is because the results were not consistent in their direction.\n\nBecause of the variety of effect sizes available within individual studies, in this paper we have analysed and presented the results of our meta-analysis using three choices of effect size. Firstly, we deﬁned the most pessimistic effect. The pessimistic effect refers to the effect size that is closest to zero, or equal to zero provided the effect sizes in a particular study range from positive to negative. Secondly, we deﬁned the most optimistic effect in a positive direction. The most optimistic positive effect refers to the effect size closest to 1.0 in a particular study. Third, we deﬁned the most optimistic effect in a negative direction. The most optimistic negative effect is the effect size closest to -1.0 in a particular study. The rules for obtaining these three effect sizes from the range of effect sizes in a particular paper is shown in Table II.\n\nVOL. 8 NO. 2 2012 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j PAGE 245\n\n# Table I\n\n# Nature of correlation revealed in the papers included in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis along with the method of analysis used\n\n|Name of authors|Date|Method|Nature of correlation found|Comments (selected nature of CSP and CFP)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Abbott and Monsen|1979|t-test|Positive|D and ROI|\n|Alexander and Buchholz|1978|Correlation|Variable|R and market return|\n|Anderson and Frankle|1980|t-test|Variable|D and stock returns|\n|Aupperle et al.|1985|Mixed|Variable|CSR1 and ROA|\n|Balkaoui|1976|T-test|Variable|SA/P/O and market return|\n|Blackburn et al.|1994|Cor\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky et al.
