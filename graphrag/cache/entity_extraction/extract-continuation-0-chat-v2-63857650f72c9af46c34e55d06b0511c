Moreover, a potential effective way of managing a company's environmental policy is by socially linking it with purchasing function activities (Humphreys et al., 2004), for instance, selecting and collaborating with green supplier (C20) focuses on the buyer-supplier relationship where close relationship is necessary and capabilities are required (Sarkis and Talluri, 2002). At the same time, enhancing environmental awareness (C21) can be used to prevent negative impacts on the environment, as well as affecting the strategic development and their corporate reputation (Matos and Hall, 2007; Eltayeb et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2019a).\n\n# 3. Method\n\n# 3.1. Fuzzy cluster method\n\nThis study applies FCM to categorize the proposed SRM criteria into several corresponding CS aspects.\n\nSupposing the raw cluster matrix is R = [rij]n×n, where r ij denotes the degree of experts' judgement, which can be stated as the following equation.\n\nSubsequently, entropy associated with each item can be calculated by means of the following equation.\n\nWhere r represents the entropy for each indicator. If an indicator has smaller r, it has higher weight (Ding et al., 2017).\n\n# L.

VS-TOPSIS for criteria\n\nThe decision matrix in TOPSIS can be generated based on the obtained aggregated matrix S, then it has to be normalized for attaining the normalized decision matrix:\n\nGiven that there are a set of criteria c = {c1, c2, …, cγ}, and the group of experts can be expressed as {d | 1 ≤ t ≤ n}, thereinto, n refers to the number of experts inside group. Initially, the original assessment information was present in the form of linguistic preference, such as very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), low (L) and very low (VL). Then the qualitative information must be transferred into corresponding vague value, as shown in Table 1. After obtaining the vague assessment matrix, p ijt was adopted to represent the transferred vague assessment result of expert d t t = [E αβt, Fαβt]γ×γ, where 0 ≤ Eαβt ≤ Fαβt ≤ 1. Detailly, on criterion ci of c, meanwhile, pijt was present with.\n\nSubsequently, this study applies the calculated entropy weight in Section 3.2 to calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix Z, which can be stated as the following equation:\n\nAdditionally, ταβt denotes the hesitant degree of expert d, which stems from hesitancy matrix H αβt, as well as being stated in Eq. (10).\n\nNext, using n-dimensional Euclidean distance to compute the geometric distance of a criterion si from the positive ideal solution x+ is given as.\n\nUltimately, the overall performance score, namely, the relative closeness of the criterion si is compared with positive ideal solution x +, which can be defined as follow:\n\nWhere 0≤RCi ≤ 1, and the obtained value RC i provide the ranking of each criterion, and the criteria acquires higher ranking are those that have higher overall performance score RC .i\n\n# L.
