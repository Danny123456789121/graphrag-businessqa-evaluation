The presence of female directors besides male directors on the board plays a vital role to increase the reputation of the company by engaging with social issues (Bear et al., 2010). Prior literature suggests that women are more sensitive to the society (Burgess and Tharenou, 2002). As a result, they increase board’s focus on CSR related issues (Ayuso and Argandoña, 2009) and charitable giving (Williams, 2003). Hence, it is predicted that there is a positive association between board gender diversity and CSD. But, the prior literature shows inconclusive results. For example, Giannarakis (2014a), Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016), and Javaid Lone et al. (2016) find a significant positive relation between women directors on the board and CSD whereas Majeed et al. (2015) finds a negative and significant association between female directors and CSD. In addition, some authors report that there is an insignificant positive impact of female directors on the CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Khan, 2010, Giannarakis, 2014b), while Kiliç et al. (2015) finds an insignificant negative relationship.\n\n# 2.4 Frequency of Board Meetings\n\nThe frequency of board meetings indicates the total number of board meetings which is a proxy of the board activeness to handle organizational issues (Khanchel, 2007). Nowadays, corporate social problems are a crucial matter for the stakeholders. Hence, it is expected that CSR-related topics are discussed at each meeting of the board to protect the interests of the\n\n# 2.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs)\n\nIt refers to the percentage of non-executive directors (NEDs) to total directors on the board. The existence of NEDs on the board is crucial because they have the proficiencies and knowledge to judge the issues arise in the meetings (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016). The ability of the NEDs is uncertain regarding governance issues (Myllys, 1999). But, NEDs can supervise to the board of directors when they observe that the act of the executive directors’ against the shareholder's interest (Jensen and Meckling, 1976, Forker, 1992). The empirical literature provides evidence that the diversity of the board of directors enhance corporate social disclosures (Siciliano, 1996). Some studies find a significant positive relationship between NEDs and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Khan, 2010, Lim et al., 2008), whereas Haniffa and Cooke (2005) finds a negative and significant association. In contrast, few studies provide no connection between NEDs and CSD (Haniffa and Cooke, 2002, Cullen and Christopher, 2002).\n\n# 2.6 CEO Duality\n\nCEO duality means the person who serves as a CEO of the company as well as the chairman of the company’s board. Prior literature measures CEO duality by taking a dummy variable equal to one when the same person serves as a CEO as well as the chairman and zero otherwise. CEO duality provides a person strong power in the decision-making process. As a result, the person does not consider the interests of the shareholders so much, and firm social activities including disclosures may be lowered (Haniffa and Cooke, 2002). Therefore, the position of CEO and chairman should be separated as it increases the monitoring quality of the issues relating to stakeholders (Li et al., 2008). However, the previous literature finds inconclusive results on the link between CEO duality and CSD. For example, some studies find a significant negative association between CEO duality and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014b, Ling and Sultana, 2015). In contrary, Razak and Mustapha (2013) and Lim et al. (2008) find an insignificant negative relationship between CEO duality and CSD. In addition, the study of Giannarakis (2014a) provides an evidence of insignificant positive impact of CEO duality on CSD.\n\n# 2.7 Auditors’ Credibility\n\nAuditors’ credibility of any firm indicates its audit quality that is the firm audited by the big audit firm (Big-four). It is predicted that Big-four audit firm conduct their audit activities\n\nsincerely (Owusu-Ansah, 1998) and Big-audit firms increase the credibility of their audited work on the annual reports (Patton and Zelenka, 1997). According to agency theory, auditor plays an effective monitoring tool on the conflict of agent-principal relationship (Lim et al., 2008). Auditors’ credibility such as their suggestions, approval of choosing accounting policies and explanations of vital issues influences on the company’s attitude regarding reporting and disclosure practices (Khan et al., 2013). However, the existing literature shows mixed results on the relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. For example, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) find a significant positive association between auditor’s credibility and CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Lu and Abeysekera (2014) provide evidence of an insignificant positive relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. Furthermore, Ling and Sultana (2015), and Alotaibi and Hussainey (201\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
