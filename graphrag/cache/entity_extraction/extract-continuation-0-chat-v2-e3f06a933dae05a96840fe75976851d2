In all cases, we use the price data to generate a time series for the return to each variable. For example, we compute the return to the EUA as: rEUA;t = ln(PEU A;t) - ln(PEU A;t - 1), where PEU A;t is the EUA price series at time t. Similarly, we compute roil;t, rgas;t, rcoal;t, and relec;t. We then use the dirty-minus-clean portfolio returns to estimate the CAPM with these additional explanatory variables. This allows us to assess the significance of these additional factors (rEUA;t, roil;t, rgas;t, rcoal;t, relec;t) and the extent to which they can affect the alpha of the regression (i.e., the carbon premium).\n\n# 8.1\n\nTable 5 reports results for two sample periods: one period ranges from May 2005 to March 2009; and the second one from May 2005 to December 2012. Note that, for this table only, we begin the regressions in May 2005 because EUA trading begins in April 2005 and hence the first observation for rEUA;t is available in May 2005.\n\nWe find that the sensitivity (beta) of the EUA, oil, gas and coal returns is positive, whereas for electricity returns it is negative. However, in all cases, the betas are insignificant. More importantly, when conditioning on these additional variables, the alpha (i.e., the carbon premium) remains largely unaffected as it is still high (about 18%) and statistically significant for the sample period that ends in March 2009. Therefore, for this sample period the carbon premium remains intact even after we account for movements in the EUA price and energy factor prices.\n\n# 8.2 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Carbon Allowances\n\nThe carbon premium depends crucially on how the dirty portfolio is defined. Our main analysis places in the dirty portfolio the eight firms which received annually more than one million free EUAs. We assess the sensitivity of the carbon premium to the composition of the dirty portfolio with two robustness checks. For both checks, we focus on the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, when the carbon premium is found to be high and significant.\n\nFirst, we maintain the same composition for the dirty portfolio that contains eight stocks, and assess whether the carbon premium is driven by any one particular stock. Figure 5 displays the alpha of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio when one of the eight stocks is dropped from the dirty portfolio. In other words, this shows the carbon premium for alternative dirty portfolios when any seven of the eight original stocks are used. We find that overall\n\n18\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nThe carbon premium is not driven by a single stock. The eight-stock portfolio delivers a CAPM-based carbon premium of 16.8%. The lowest CAPM-based carbon premium among the seven-stock portfolios is around 14%, which corresponds to the case of the chemical company SDF being dropped. Using any one of the seven-stock dirty portfolios gives similar results to using the eight-stock dirty portfolio. We conclude, therefore, that the carbon premium remains largely unaffected when we exclude any one stock, including the one with the largest effect.\n\nSecond, we use alternative criteria for inclusion of stocks into the dirty portfolio. As seen in Table 6, when the cutoff point of carbon allowances reduces from one million EUAs to 0.5 million EUAs, the number of stocks increases from eight to 10. Similarly, at 0.1 million EUAs, there are 14 stocks in the dirty portfolio and, finally, when all dirty stocks are included their number reaches a maximum of 24. In setting a lower number of EUAs as the criterion for inclusion in the dirty portfolio, we find that the alphas decrease monotonically. The decay is initially slow and then accelerates as more firms are included in the dirty portfolio. Specifically, the CAPM-based carbon premium is as follows: for the eight-stock portfolio it is 16.8% and significant; it decreases to 13.9% for the 10-stock portfolio and is still significant; then goes down further to 11.1% for the 14-stock portfolio and is still significant; and, finally, ends at 4.3% for the all-inclusive portfolio but now is insignificant.\n\nThese results are graphically illustrated in Figure 6. The figure shows the annualized CAPM-based carbon premium when we add one stock at a time to the original dirty portfolio of eight stocks. The stocks are added in sequence according to the number of their carbon allowances: each time the stock with the highest number of carbon allowances not already in the portfolio is added to it. The figure also shows the 95% confidence interval of the CAPM-based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The figure clearly illustrates the monotonicity in the relation of performance and carbon allowances: the more stocks we add to the dirty portfolio, the lower the number of carbon emissions the additional stock contributes to the portfolio, and the lower the CAPM of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio. This is further evidence that high carbon emissions lead to high abnormal excess returns for our sample.\n\n19\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 8.3 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Firms\n\nOur analysis uses data on 65 of the 80 firms included in the DAX and MDAX stock indexes.
