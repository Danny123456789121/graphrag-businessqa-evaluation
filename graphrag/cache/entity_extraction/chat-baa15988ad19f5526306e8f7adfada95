These strategic management considerations would be consistent with Baron’s (2000) managerial approach to the business–society interface. Baron (2000) argues that successful executives are able to integrate market strategies with non-market strategies in order to position their firm for optimal effectiveness. Baron’s (2000) book offers guidelines as to how firms can strategically achieve this integration in a number of areas (such as the news media, activists, social movements, legislatures, ethics, and so on). Alternatively, social performance may increase through less deliberate decision processes, as firms emulate others that are experiencing high financial success (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Either evolutionary process would reduce the importance of coercive control.\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nmechanisms (in the form of government regulations) for effecting public welfare and ecological sustainability. If the mental models of managers and regulators moved to this more libertarian framework, the primary role of regulations would be their signalling function with respect to prioritizing certain issues and certain constituents’ claims over others.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTheoretically, portraying managers’ choices with respect to CSP and CFP as an either/or trade-off is not justified in light of 30 years of empirical data. This meta-analysis has shown that (1) across studies, CSP is positively correlated with CFP, (2) the relationship tends to be bidirectional and simultaneous, (3) reputation appears to be an important mediator of the relationship, and (4) stakeholder mismatching, sampling error, and measurement error can explain between 15 percent and 100 percent of the cross-study variation in various subsets of CSP–CFP correlations. Corporate virtue in the form of social and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is rewarding in more ways than one.\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Organization Studies 24(3)\n\n# CFP\n\n|Reliability of| |.63| | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|CSP|.58|.33|.66|.86|.64|.44|.34|.93|\n\n# Overview of Studies Included in Meta-Analysis\n\n# Measure of CSP\n\n# Appendix A\n\n|Number of reported|Market return on security|RAO, excess market return|Composite of (1) ROA, (2) EPS growth, ROE, ROC log (sales), and (4) risk excess market valuation|Perceptual/expectational|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Avg. annual % return to (LT and ST)|Excess market return of|Monthly stock returns, change in EPS, change|dividends/share|risk-adjusted|\n|investors|ROSBTA|EPS|ROE|Pro|\n|Social Involvements Concern for Society|Social responsibility disclosures|Pollution control expenditures in|CSR1 in ARs, CEP Indexes (D)|KLD scores and Fortune ratings|\n|responsibility|Moskowitz reputation index (R)|Coding of ARs for CSR1 (D)|to the community/environment|1989 Ratings of Council On Economic Priorities (CEP)|\n|Criterion validity of CSR1|Reputational ratings (R)|Disclosure scale (D)|dichotomized (D)|disclosures (CSR1)|\n|ARs (SA/P/O)|(SA/P/O)|(SA/P/O, R)| | |\n\n| |1|4|18|6|24|3|1|2|15|10|2|9|9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |.44 to .87 (t)|.04 (t) to .13|.23 to .10 (t)| | |.72 to .91 (t)| | |.25 to .34|.01 to .30| |.30, .35 (t)|.22 to .69|\n| |.04, .21|.58 to .72| | | |49 to 62| | |41, 47| | |166 to 228|119 to 232|\n\n# Author(s) (year)\n\n|Alexander and Buchholz (1978)|Anderson and Frankle (1980)|Bragdon and Marlin (1972)|Abbott and Monsen (1979)|Bowman and Haire (1975)|Cochran and Wood (1984)|Conine and Madden (1987)| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Blackburn et al.
