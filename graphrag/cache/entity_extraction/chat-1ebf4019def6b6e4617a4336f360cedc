First, a firm’s ability to encourage stakeholder integration can be considered an organizational capability (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Second, successful stakeholder management allows firms to access and capitalize on tangible and intangible resources (Russo & Minto, 2012). Moreover, stakeholders can provide incentives or information to improve a firm’s efficiency and thus may push firms to explore profit opportunities that have been overlooked by the firms’ management or whose costs have been overestimated and whose benefits have been underestimated (Hart & Dowell, 2011; Kim & Statman, 2012; King & Lenox, 2002). Along these lines, Sharma and Vredenburg (1998), for example, showed that effective stakeholder integration may enable firms to improve their waste reduction and energy conservation programs and thus may contribute to the development of valuable organizational capabilities.

Endrikat et al. / European Management Journal xxx (2014) xxx–xxx\n\ngue that conﬂating instrumental stakeholder arguments with the ‘resources and capability accentuation’ of the NRBV provides a so- lid theoretical basis to propose a positive link from CEP to CFP.\n\nCFP inﬂuences CEP\n\nWhile most of the research on the CEP–CFP relationship focused on the question whether it pays to be green and thus examined the causal link from CEP to CFP, some scholars emphasized the possi- bility that the causal direction might be the other way around (i.e., from CFP to CEP) (e.g., Dooley & Lerner, 1994; McGuire, Sund- gren, & Schneeweis, 1988; Ullmann, 1985). Formally stated by Waddock and Graves (1997), the slack resources hypothesis sug- gests that superior CFP results in available (slack) resources that al- low companies to invest in environmental activities. Organizational slack can be deﬁned as ‘‘that cushion of actual or potential resources which allows an organization to adapt successfully to internal pressures for adjustment or to external pressures for change’’ (Bourgeois, 1981, p. 30). It allows ﬁrms to make invest- ments in resources and capabilities that are not likely to immedi- ately pay-off but that are necessary to improve the speed and degree to which ﬁrms can adapt to their external environments (Bansal, 2005; Cheng & Kesner, 1997; Levinthal & March, 1981). As emphasized by the NRBV, the development and implementation of environmental strategies and management practices draw on several resources and capabilities. Consequently, organizational slack allows ﬁrms to direct more resources towards the improve- ment of CEP (Kock, Santaló, & Diestre, 2012) and permits ﬁrms the latitude to seek innovative and environmentally sound solu- tions (Bansal, 2005; Russo & Fouts, 1997).\n\nAn implicit assumption of the slack resources hypothesis is that high levels of CFP result in available slack resources (e.g., Dooley & Lerner, 1994; Makni, Francoeur, & Bellavance, 2009; Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Schreck, 2011). Correspondingly, the majority of studies testing the slack resources hypothesis draw on CFP mea- sures as proxies for slack (e.g., Clarkson, Li et al., 2011; Schreck, 2011; Surroca et al., 2010). However, it is worth mentioning that superior CFP does not necessarily result in organizational slack. Nevertheless, literature on organizational slack constantly con- ceived CFP as a precursor of slack resources (Seifert, Morris, & Bartkus, 2004; Singh, 1986) and thus slack is more likely to appear in high CFP ﬁrms. Moreover, Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, and Turner provided meta-analytic evidence for a positive relationship between slack resources and CFP.\n\nBidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP\n\nGiven that both the arguments for a positive link from CEP to CFP and those for the reverse direction hold, the relationship be- tween CEP and CFP would be reciprocally causal, forming what Hart and Ahuja (1996) termed a virtuous circle. A possible theoret- ical explanation for such a bidirectional relationship refers to an integration of the reasoning of the NRBV (complemented by instru- mental stakeholder arguments) with the slack resources hypothe- sis (Surroca et al., 2010). Without a conjecture about where the circle begins, whether in the availability of slack resources (result- ing from superior CFP) or in initial environmental activities (Waddock & Graves, 1997), CEP and CFP may reinforce each other and thus constitute a complex relationship involving causal mecha- nisms going from CEP to CFP as well as mechanisms in which high- er levels of CFP lead to increased CEP.
