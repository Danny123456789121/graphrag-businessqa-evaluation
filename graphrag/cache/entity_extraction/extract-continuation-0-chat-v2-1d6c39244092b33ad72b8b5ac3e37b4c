We believe the time scope is appropriate to focus, review, and explore the focal relations in this unique East Asian setting.\n\nOur research contributes to CSR literature in several ways. First, previous research was limited to CSR samples mostly in Western countries. In contrast, we explore CSR in East Asia by considering both categories of CSR and the measurement of performance. The meta-analysis results have helped us cross validate insights from different studies and reconcile inconsistent findings on the relationship between CSR and business performance.\n\n1 For the purpose of this study, East Asia includes China (PRC), North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong (PRC), Macau (PRC), and Taiwan.\n\n2 The first empirical research included appears in 2001.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nperformance. Second, strategy is always bound by the contingent context, so we investi-\n\ngate the different levels of moderators and the evolution of CSR in East Asia. The findings\n\nhave thus extended our understanding on the boundary conditions of the relationship\n\nbetween CSR and business performance in East Asia. Third, to answer questions about\n\nCSR measurement modes, we explore measure as a moderator. Thus we aim to uncover\n\ncumulative evidence of East Asian CSR as it relates to business performance.\n\nThe remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review\n\nthe concepts and invoke the signaling theory and institutional theory to propose the\n\nresearch framework, including various moderators. Next we provide detailed method-\n\nology of meta-analysis and research findings. Finally, we discuss limitations, future\n\nresearch directions, and conclusions.\n\n# Theory and hypotheses\n\n# The concept and theory of CSR in East Asia\n\n# CSR in East Asia\n\nCSR is generally viewed as “context-specific organizational actions and policies that take\n\ninto account stakeholders’ expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and\n\nenvironmental performance” (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012: 137). Western researchers began to\n\nuse the term commonly in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational\n\ncorporations formed the concept of stakeholders; that is, internal, external, and environ-\n\nmental constituents who can influence or are influenced by firms’ activities (Freeman,\n\n1984). CSR henceforth became a hotspot in business ethics research (Luo & Bhattacharya,\n\n2006). Most global academic CSR studies focus on America and Europe (Wood, 2010).\n\nHowever, CSR is receiving growing attention in Asian contexts where characteristics might\n\ndiverge from American or European contexts (Baughn et al., 2007). In this study, we focus\n\nCSR in East Asia, which has been used to refer to a wide geographical area covering\n\nPeople’s Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. East Asia has received\n\nparticular interests in the respect of CSR as it is characterized by a unique understanding\n\nand practice of CSR (Scholtens & Kang, 2012). For example, a cross-country comparison\n\nshowed that philanthropy, a type of CSR, is most prevalent in North America, significantly\n\nlower in Europe, and even lower in Asia; Asians tend to focus on CSR’s economic\n\nrationale, but ignore issues such as human rights for employees; Asian firms ask employees\n\nto work longer hours (Welford, 2005). Business students in the United States and Hong\n\nKong surveyed about CSR showed that Westerners are more likely to cite noneconomic,\n\nethical, and legal rationales for CSR, while Easterners prefer economic rationales\n\n(Burton, Farh, & Hegarty, 2000). Similarly, the China-developed CSC9000T (China Social\n\nCompliance 9000 for Textile and Apparel industry) differs sharply from normal CSR\n\nactivities in Western countries. Moreover, Asians may view CSR value uniquely because\n\nthey are influenced by both Western ideas and Eastern values. It is worth noting that though\n\nlots of CEOs in East Asian firms do not understand the content and meaning of CSR,\n\nenvironmental protection and charitable activity are widely known and adopted in this\n\nregion. In practice, the concept of CSR is not really a fresh one in East Asia, and CSR\n\npractices may be known by philanthropy and other names (Baughn et al., 2007).\n\n# M. Hou et al.\n\n# Signaling theory and institutional theory\n\nDiverse theories, such as agency theory, stakeholder theory, stewardship theory, institutional theory, and classical economic theory, have been used to explain the CSR–performance link, and each theory offers insights for explaining the linkage. For instance, agency theory suggests that some managers adopt CSR to advance their careers or for self-aggrandizement, using firm resources that would be better returned to firm shareholders or spent on urgent projects (Friedman, 1970). Stewardship theory, by contrast, implies that firm managers are morally compelled to conduct CSR activities without considering the actual value to business performance (Donaldson & Davis, 1991). In this study, we emphasize that signaling theory and the institutional theory can jointly contribute to the CSR literature.\n\n# Signaling theory\n\nSignaling theory took root in the idea of asymmetries information between two parties where the causes of asymmetric information (a deviation from perfect information) are primarily derived from quality information or intent information (Connelly, Certo, Ireland, & Reutzel, 2011). One party credibly conveys information of quality and shows the unobservable attributes of itself to another party with the purpose of gaining a premium (Spence, 1973). While intent information can help parties reduce the possible moral hazards that result from the behavior of the individuals or organizations during the transaction (Su, Peng, Tan, & Chueng, 2014). Spence’s (1973) job market signaling model illustrates that the potential\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>GEO<|>East Asia is a geographical region that includes countries such as China, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, known for its unique understanding and practice of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<|>GEO<|>The People's Republic of China is a country in East Asia that is part of the study on CSR practices and their impact on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>North Korea is a country in East Asia included in the research on CSR practices and their implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>South Korea is a country in East Asia that is examined in the context of CSR practices and their effects on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is a country in East Asia that is part of the research focusing on CSR and its relationship with business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, included in the study of CSR practices in East Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACAU<|>GEO<|>Macau is a Special Administrative Region of China that is part of the East Asian CSR research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIWAN<|>GEO<|>Taiwan is a territory in East Asia that is included in the research on CSR practices and their impact on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to organizational actions and policies that consider stakeholders' expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>PERSON<|>Aguinis & Glavas are researchers who contributed to the definition and understanding of CSR in their 2012 work.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREEMAN<|>PERSON<|>Freeman is a researcher known for his work on stakeholder theory, which is relevant to the understanding of CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUO & BHATTACHARYA<|>PERSON<|>Luo & Bhattacharya are researchers who have contributed to the literature on CSR and business ethics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAUGHN ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Baughn et al. are researchers who have studied CSR practices in Asian contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WELFORD<|>PERSON<|>Welford is a researcher who has discussed the differences in CSR practices between Western and Asian firms.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>CSR<|>The research focuses on CSR practices specifically in the context of East Asia, highlighting its unique characteristics<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<|>EAST ASIA<|>The People's Republic of China is a significant part of East Asia and is included in the CSR study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH KOREA<|>EAST ASIA<|>North Korea is included in the geographical scope of the CSR research in East Asia<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>EAST ASIA<|>South Korea is part of the East Asian countries examined for CSR practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPAN<|>EAST ASIA<|>Japan is included in the study of CSR practices in East Asia<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONG KONG<|>EAST ASIA<|>Hong Kong is part of the East Asian region studied for CSR practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACAU<|>EAST ASIA<|>Macau is included in the geographical area of East Asia relevant to CSR research<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAIWAN<|>EAST ASIA<|>Taiwan is part of the East Asian context being studied for CSR practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>CSR<|>Aguinis & Glavas contributed to the understanding of CSR through their research<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREEMAN<|>CSR<|>Freeman's stakeholder theory is foundational to the understanding of CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUO & BHATTACHARYA<|>CSR<|>Luo & Bhattacharya have provided insights into CSR and its implications for business ethics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAUGHN ET AL.<|>CSR<|>Baughn et al. have studied CSR practices specifically in Asian contexts, contributing to the literature<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WELFORD<|>CSR<|>Welford has discussed the differences in CSR practices between Western and Asian firms, adding to the understanding of CSR<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
