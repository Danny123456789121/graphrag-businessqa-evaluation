Previous research indicates that AI can be an efficient and effective way of managing HR functions to enhance fairness. However, ChatGPT is designed to synthesise information from the database available, applying algorithms used to train it. While ChatGPT is designed to be neutral, the data it deploys to generate the texts come from a wide range of sources from the Internet, which may contain biased opinions and prejudices including, for example, racist and sexist language. Therefore, the use of AI has mixed benefits and pitfalls for organisations adopting the technology and their employees.\n\n# Employment security\n\nA key function and benefit of ChatGPT is that it can search and generate basic documents on a specific topic rapidly such as producing job descriptions and person specifications in detail. However, these documents need to be checked and customised, which requires more advanced skills and knowledge. Indeed, the increased use of digital technology has led to the displacement of many workers at the lower occupational levels, including bank tellers, IT engineers and legal workers. For HR professionals, there may be fewer job vacancies at the lower level. Since women tend to be over-represented at the lower occupational levels, they may be disproportionally displaced. Equally, older workers have been the victims of technological changes due to their reduced capabilities to learn new technology. In the IT industry, workers above the age of 40 may be at serious risk of being made redundant.\n\n# Recruitment and selection\n\nAn increasing number of organisations are using AI for recruitment and selection to increase efficiency and accuracy, especially when they must process a large number of applications. AI is also perceived to be more objective and thus enhances the fairness of the selection by avoiding human subjectivity and biases. Equally, it has been argued that AI is inherently a deductive process and neglects qualitative information which humans may be in a better position to pick up and interpret (Newman et al., 2020). A similar argument could be made for the use of Chat GPT in recruitment and selection. EDI is an area that would benefit from human inputs to detect nuanced and sensitive information from the applications.\n\n# Performance appraisal\n\nPerformance appraisal is one of the most subjective functions of HRM and one that managers tend to dislike and avoid if possible (Keegan & Den Hartog, 2019; Posthuma et al., 2018). Where performance could be quantified, AI has been used for the appraisal of employees to inform HRM decisions such as reward, employee development and dismissal. AI is believed to provide neutral feedback without gender, race or other forms of bias. In cultural contexts where direct and face-to-face criticisms are avoided to preserve face for both parties (such as in Chinese societies), AI can potentially be a more effective medium for appraisals and help individual employees to improve their performance quietly due to reduced resistance and resentment because there is no human interaction and perceived bias. However, it has been argued that when AI is involved in the decision-making process, managers are more likely to act in a morally disengaged manner and justify their decision (Bandura, 1999). A case in point is Amazon which has been criticised for using AI to select poor-performing employees for dismissal (Lecher, 2019).\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 27\n\nPay. Pay is another sensitive and contentious HR function in which perceived and actual fairness and equity is critical but difficult to achieve for institutional and organisational reasons. In fact, gender pay gap has been found persistent in many economies, developed and developing alike, and gender discrimination has been found one of the main reasons for gender pay gaps (Blau & Kahn, 2007; Lips, 2013). The use of ChatGPT may arguably entrench the gender pay gap as the data it draws from may be historical data with past bias against women, ethnic minorities and other socially disadvantaged groups, allowing these biases to be perpetuated and continue to be barriers to pay equity which undermines organisations' EDI efforts.\n\n# 4.2.2 Research agenda for EDI\n\nThe use of ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools is still in its early stage, albeit rapidly developing in both creative ways of their adoption and regulatory interventions. There are ample research opportunities for HRM scholars. We outline a few of them here as examples to entice more attention for future research to advance the theorisation and management practice in this space.\n\n1. Given the uneven quality of the data used by ChatGPT to generate documents, how can organisations ensure the quality of the materials it generates so that it does not undermine the principle of ethics and outcomes of EDI? Will the use of ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools influence managerial behaviour such that they behave differently in AI-human cooperation than in human-human cooperation?\n2. How can ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools be used effectively to enhance fairness and procedural justice in HRM functions and activities through AI-human cooperation? What may be the antecedents and boundary conditions?\n3. How are society-specific factors played out in the use of ChatGPT in different HRM functions and activities? For example, will the use of ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools help managers avoid giving critical comments to poor-performing employees and help employees gain face, thus maintaining a good work relationship?\n4. How can ChatGPT help in content creation for job descriptions and competency guides while reducing unconscious/implicit biases and discrimination in recruitment/selection processes? How can organisations regulate the use of ChatGPT and similar AI tools to detect potential\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
