Depending on the research context, the application of survey-based measures can even be the preferred choice of researchers. A quarter of empirical studies in top management journals therefore use some kind of subjective organizational performance measure (P. J. Richard, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). Perceptual CFP measures are compiled by one-fifth of the meta-studies in our sample. We formulate our hypothesis in accordance with meta-analyses that report high correlations between CSP and perceptual CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006):\n\n# H3a:\n\nCSP has the strongest relation to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.\n\n# Operational CFP\n\nOperational performance such as productivity allows a nuanced conceptualization of business performance as it focuses on those operational success factors that might lead to superior CFP (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). As an intermediate-outcome metric (Peloza, 2009), it reflects information that is closer to the value creation process within a firm and more remote to the variety of interacting and overlapping factors like discretionary accounting practices or general stock market movements (P. J. Richard et al., 2009). McWilliams, Siegel, and Teoh (1999) caution not to use share prices as a sole metric for CFP when investigating the CSP-CFP relation. Effects of specific plant or product-level information on value creation cannot be fully captured by simply looking at market-based.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

Mgmt. 2018\n\nDOI: 10.1002/csr\n\n# Corporate social and financial performance\n\nmeasures such as shareholder value. Therefore, the effects of CSP on operational CFP measures should be less likely to be drowned out by capital market ‘noise’ (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527). Empirical evidence for this argument was found in a meta-analysis on human resource factors (Combs et al., 2006): operational CFP measures such as staff turnover yield higher correlations than other accounting- or market-based performance categories. Similar results were carried out in the environmental supply chain context: operational CFP measures such as reduced material and waste streams demonstrated slightly higher correlations to market-based measures (Golicic & Smith, 2013). Thus, we hypothesize:\n\n# H3b: CSP has a stronger relation to operational CFP than to market-based CFP.\n\n# Traditional CFP Categories\n\nWhen considering the range of the traditional CFP measures, Cochran and Wood (1984) propose that accounting-based CFP such as return on assets may be the best proxy for measuring CFP – presuming that the accounting practices of firms are comparable. They more adequately reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external evaluations of investors. Empirical evidence supports this: accounting-based CFP measures have a stronger relation to CSP than market-based CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006).\n\nGrowth-based CFP – typically determined by sales, profit, or employee growth – is not directly affected by capital market developments. However, companies’ growth can be distorted by inorganic growth from acquisitions or divestments. Such activities usually have a relatively higher impact on growth measures (O’Shaughnessy & Flanagan, 1998) compared to changes in accounting figures (King, Dalton, Daily, & Covin, 2004). Accordingly, empirical research finds a weaker CFP relation for growth as a CFP measure compared to accounting-based CFP (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2013; Unger et al., 2011).\n\nWith regards to risk, primary research (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; J. B. McGuire et al., 1988) suggests that CSP reduces companies’ risk. Most of the empirical studies measure risk either as accounting-based risk (i.e. debt to assets) or market-based risk (i.e. beta-factor, total volatility). However, the observed correlations in meta-analyses are relatively low (e.g. Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Summing up, these arguments bring us to the following hypothesis:\n\n# H3c: Accounting-based CFP demonstrates a stronger relation to CSP than growth-, risk-, and market-based CFP.\n\n# Mutual Funds\n\nSeveral studies on mutual funds, financial indices, and virtual portfolios suggest that the positive CSP-CFP relation is weaker compared to studies using firm-specific CFP measures. To date, this result presents a puzzling outcome in CSP-CFP research. The first mutual funds studies appeared in the early 1990s. The initial findings of these early studies discovered that the performance of CSP-oriented mutual funds is not statistically different from the performance of conventional mutual funds (e.g. Hamilton, Jo, & Statman, 1993). However, ever since then, further investigations have been carried out in several primary and review studies (Bauer, Koedijk, & Otten, 2005; Capelle-Blancard & Monjon, 2014; Rathner, 2013; Revelli & Viviani, 2015), hardening the conclusion that the CSP-CFP link is weaker for mutual funds as compared to other CSP-CFP studies. In turn, we hypothesize:\n\n# H3d: Studies on mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-C\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VENKATRAMAN<|>PERSON<|>Venkatraman is a researcher known for contributions to the field of management, particularly in the context of organizational performance measures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAMANUJAM<|>PERSON<|>Ramanujam is a researcher who has collaborated with Venkatraman on studies related to organizational performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P.
