This does not, of course, preclude the possibility of biases, or incorrect choices, by the said contractors. This model became GPT-3.5. It was enhanced to better handle diverse prompts using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) technique (Ouyang et al., 2023). This involved creating a reward model with comparison data, where contractors ranked multiple responses generated by the model for a given prompt, so the AI could learn which response was the most relevant (Schulman et al., 2017). In essence, this allowed humans (or, rather, a few individuals) to guide the model's learning process and refine its ability to produce high-quality responses.\n\nThe GPT-4 model was created with the aim of improving alignment between the model's output and user intentions (Open AI GPT 4 Research Blog, 2023). This involves enhancing the accuracy of the model's output and reducing the occurrence of offensive language, but this has done little to resolve AI's signature bland writing style. Compared to its predecessor GPT-3.5, GPT-4 has shown better performance in terms of factual correctness and lower error rates; this does not mean that it could not generate falsities on demand. It also provides greater steerability, allowing users to adjust the model's tone and style to suit their preferences. Additionally, GPT-4 ostensibly incorporates better guardrails to prevent inappropriate responses, demonstrating a greater adherence to ethical considerations. However, these measures are limited to the rules and community standards set by the developers. There are several ways to jailbreak GPT-4, which is a method to use specific prompts bypassing the guardrails and unlocking restricted features that may make GPT-4 spread misinformation and showcase unethical behaviour (Loynds, 2023). Unlike its predecessors, which are limited to processing text, GPT-4 can process both text and images. This allows GPT-4 to analyse the content of an image and connect it with a written question, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the context. However, it should be noted that GPT-4 is not designed to generate images, but only to analyse them. Nonetheless, AI's capacity to generate pastiches from styles of art is well known; the same goes for its capacity to generate academic papers.\n\nThe authenticity of responses generated by generative AI such as GPT-4 is limited because these algorithms are opaque in the sense that they do not explain how the responses were generated and the source of the training data is also unknown. Moreover, the algorithms' capability to generate false information (somewhat kindly called “hallucinations”), has raised significant concerns on the trustworthiness of the outputs, which may pose serious ethical and reputational risks for organisations planning to use the AI outputs. For example, Google shares lost $100 billion due to an inaccurate response from Bard (Google AI chatbot) on Twitter during a demonstration in February 2023 (Thorbecke, 2023). It is unclear if a deceit and the capacity to generate false information is built into some of the more prominent AI systems or is an autonomous and conscious choice of the latter; each would raise serious ethical concerns.\n\nIn the context of business applications of GPT-4, the language learning application Duolingo is utilizing a GPT-4 model to improve personalized learning, Be My Eyes, provider of assistive technology is using it to create a solution for individuals with visual impairments to make them aware of their surroundings (Derico & Kleinman, 2023). Microsoft Bing, 2023 is using GPT-4 to improve search engine user experience, and Stripe, a financial platform, is employing it to safeguard chatrooms from spams and fraudsters (Stripe Newsroom, 2023). Morgan Stanley is using GPT-4 for streamlining internal technical support processes (Davenport, 2023), and Salesforce has implemented it to provide personalised recommendations to help users with their queries (Yakar, 2023). Most notably, government of Iceland has partnered with OpenAI to use GPT-4 to preserve the Icelandic language (OpenAI Customer Stories, 2023). Microsoft Office 365 is integrating GPT-4 to create an entire PowerPoint presentation with a single text prompt or summarize long documents in Word (Microsoft Blog, 2023). The initial business applications of generative AI demonstrate its capabilities, but the ultimate acceptance and adoption of this technology will depend on the resolution of significant ethical and security concerns.\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\nThe emergence of ChatGPT in the public domain has also sparked a surge of interest and competition in the AI chatbot market. Microsoft's announcement of a $10 billion investment in OpenAI has further amplified this trend, prompting other technology providers to enter the race. Google has recently launched an experimental service called “Bard”, and ‘Project Magi’ (to revolutionise web\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
