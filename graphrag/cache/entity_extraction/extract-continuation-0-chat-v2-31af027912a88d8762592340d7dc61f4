Gautier and Pache (2015) found that “many variations appear across firms, industries, and periods, as robust and widespread conclusions remain to be drawn” (Gautier and Pache 2015). At the same time, Liket and Simaens (2015) stated that “when studying the relationship between CP and CFP in a direct way, the evidence seems to paint a mixed picture.” In this context, our study intends to advance the discussion on business benefits of CP by providing a comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis of subgroups of studies investigating this phenomenon.\n\nUsing a meta-analysis approach (Hedges and Olkin 1985; Hunter and Schmidt 2004), we integrated the results of 45 empirical studies, including 183 effect sizes, on the relationship between CP and CFP. Based on a contingency perspective, we explore how different study design factors, such as variable measurement, sample characteristics, as well as controlled moderating variables, influence the results. Particularly, we focus on the implementation of temporal sequences in study designs, i.e. time-lagged measurement of variables, as only these results are valid for the interpretation of causal relationships (Mitchell and James 2001). As a consequence, our study helps to establish a status quo of a positive relationship between CP and subsequently measured CFP across a range of different study designs. More importantly, it moves the discussion away from the question if a relationship between CP and CFP exists towards the question how and when CP positively affects CFP by identifying aspects that beg closer examination. Furthermore, we highlight how the levers of control framework of Simons (1994) might help to explain the causal link between CP and CFP and adds another intersection to be explored by scholars of both CP and management control research fields.\n\nAfter the introduction, the paper is set up as follows. The “theoretical background” section provides definitions of the analyzed variables, outlines the fundamental interrelations between them, and formulates research questions to investigate the influence of time-lagged variable measurement, study design factors, and methodological moderators on the CP–CFP relationship. The third section briefly explains the employed method with respect to the data sample, coding, and meta-analytical integration of study results. In the “results”, meta-analysis outcomes are presented for the general relationship between CP and CFP, and for the particular relationship of CP and subsequent CFP with respect to study design factors and moderating variables. The “discussion” section sums up findings regarding the posed research questions. Furthermore, limitations of this study and recommendations for further research are presented.\n\n# Theoretical background\n\n# The relationship between CP and CFP: Doing well by doing good?\n\nBefore discussing the relationship between CP and CFP, it is important to clarify what these terms represent in this study. Very few scholars which have addressed the topic of CP have offered clear definitions about their understanding of what CP exactly\n\nF. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nis (Gautier and Pache 2015). This might cause confusion about which activities are considered as part of CP. Madden et al. (2006) define CP as “the voluntary business giving of money, time or in-kind goods, without any direct commercial benefit, to one or more organizations whose core purpose is to benefit the community’s welfare”. This definition is consistent with definitions used by several other authors (Schwartz 1968; Godfrey 2005) and is taken as the basis of the research conducted within this study.\n\nIn the context of the CP literature, the question has been raised by many if ‘doing good’ in a societal sense is related to ‘doing well’ in financial terms (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis et al. 2009). Doing well financially is commonly expressed by the term CFP (Hamann et al. 2013). CFP captures the “social and economic outcomes resulting from the interplay among an organization’s attributes, actions, and environment” (Combs et al. 2005) and is represented by indicators such as profit, sales growth, or market returns (Hamann et al. 2013).\n\nThere are many reasons that suggest a positive relationship between CP and CFP. On the one hand, with a healthy enterprise that generates considerable profits each year, decision makers can afford to give money to charity. If most capital is earmarked for retaining the enterprise’s profitable status and avoiding bankruptcy, there might be few resources, in the form of time or money, left to engage in philanthropic activities. For this reason, slack resource theory proposes that strong CFP represents an essential prerequisite of CP, suggesting a causal effect of CFP on CP (Adams and Hardwick 1998; Buchholtz et al. 1999; Seifert et al. 2003). On the other hand, several theoretical arguments which are mainly derived from stakeholder theory (Freeman 1984), and can also be based on ideas of Simons’ levers of controls framework (Simons 1994), propose that companies can benefit from engaging in CP, indicating a positive causal effect of CP on CFP.\n\nEngaging with society by donating cash, in-kind goods, or employee worktime can improve an organization’s performance on several internal and external levels. Externally, philanthropic giving can enhance reputation. This might help to establish a more loyal customer base (Luo 2005), ensure the license to operate within communities (Lim 2010), and serve as a reputational insurance in case of negative\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GAUTIER AND PACHE<|>PERSON<|>Gautier and Pache are researchers who conducted literature reviews on the relationship between corporate philanthropy (CP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIKET AND SIMAENS<|>PERSON<|>Liket and Simaens are researchers who reviewed literature on corporate philanthropy and its impact on corporate financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEDGES AND OLKIN<|>PERSON<|>Hedges and Olkin are researchers known for their work on meta-analysis methods used in empirical studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER AND SCHMIDT<|>PERSON<|>Hunter and Schmidt are researchers who contributed to meta-analytical integration of study results in the context of corporate philanthropy and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMONS<|>PERSON<|>Simons is a researcher known for the levers of control framework, which helps explain the relationship between corporate philanthropy and corporate financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F.
