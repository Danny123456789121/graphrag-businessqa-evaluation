Cziraki, Renneboog, & Szilagyi (2010) report that the frequency of proposals is just over 4 percent of publicly-listed companies in the U.S. over 1996-2005 but only around 1 percent in the UK and Continental Europe. Similarly, Judge et al. (2010) find that in a sample of over 9,000 shareholder activism incidents in over 10 countries, 52 percent occur in the U.S.\n6. While the focus of our paper is on gender diversity, the shareholder proposals in our sample typically call for increased representation from “women” and “minorities” / “persons of color”. Because we are not able to identify board members from minority groups through RiskMetrics of the majority of our time frame, we are not able to compare our sample to S&P 1500 firms on this dimension.\n7. We do not include time period controls in Table 5 since we match on year, in effect controlling for time effects in Models 1 and 2. However, in sensitivity tests, we add indicator variables for the time period following SOX (Post Sox), 2002-2008, when requirements for board independence increased; and following Regulation S-K (Post Disclose), 2009-2011, when enhanced proxy statement disclosures requirements, including those pertaining to board diversity, were introduced. Post Sox and Post Disclose are not significant in Models 1 or 2, as expected. However, we find both variables to be positive and significant in Models 3B and 3C, suggesting that financial activists are more likely to target firms in later years. Further, when we control for these time periods, Board Independence approaches significance in Model 3C (p = 0.12 in two-tailed tests) providing weak support for Hypothesis 2b.\n8. Mean values (p-values for difference) for target and non-target firms for the independent variables are: Female Representation of 3.0 percent versus 4.4 percent (p = 0.01); Board Independence of 61.1 percent versus 61.8 percent (p = 0.70); SIZE of\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, target firms are equivalent on all dimensions except female representation. Although we always select a match with the closest propensity score in absolute value terms, our target firms have significantly higher scores than our control firms (p = 0.01) and are higher in 2/3 of the 120 cases. We attribute this to the fact that our sample firms often have the highest propensity to be targeted among all the firms in industry. These statistics underscore our finding in Table 5 that activists target firms with unusually low female board representation. Also, while non-target firms have significantly lower female representation than S&P 1500 firms on average, they are still not as low as our sample firms. We conduct additional tests in Table 7 to control for Female Representation.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nAbbott, L.J., Parker, S., & Presley, T.J.
