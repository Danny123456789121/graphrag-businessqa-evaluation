Countries with advanced economies, such as the US, followed by the UK and Germany, have a greater number of\n\nstudies. In addition, it can be observed that most researches were conducted in developed economies. Some have been conducted in developing economies such as China and Malaysia. China is the country with the largest CO2 emissions in the world. It is often the object of study in sustainability-related studies. This fact is evident in the sample since China appears in fifth place.\n\nFinally, among the 88 articles, few studies developed an empirical study in more than one country. Sharma et al. (2007), Judge and Elenkov (2005), Luzzini et al. (2015), Sarpin et al. (2016), Behnam et al. (2018) and Betts et al. (2018) are some examples. Since cross-country research is more difficult to perform, studies focusing on this aspect are still rare.\n\n# Fig. 7.

There is a total of 36 words with a minimum occurrence of 5 times. It is observed that the most outstanding words are “competitive advantage”, “resource-based view” and “dynamic capabilities” and these have a greater incidence in the time interval from 2014 to 2016. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the most recent themes within this subject are “firm performance”, “eco-innovation”, “market orientation” and “collaboration”. In general, it can be analyzed that the keywords are very interrelated with each other and with the area of business strategy and corporate sustainability. For example, we identified terms with different approaches to (i) performance (financial performance, business performance, environmental performance), (ii) strategy (strategic management, environmental strategy), (iii)\n\nJournal Pre-proof\n\ncompetitive advantage and those related terms, and, (iv) sustainability (such as green, environmental management, corporate social performance, among others).\n\n# Fig. 8.
