The value of QM is equal to 151.1894 (p < .0001, df = 5), which indicates that the different types of operationalizations of CSR are significantly moderating the relationship between CSR and CFP. In other words, the relationships based on different measurement strategies of CSR are significantly different (see Table 2).\n\n# Moderating Effects of Meta-Analysis of CSR Operationalization\n\nCSR = corporate social responsibility; CI = confidence interval.\n|Total sample size|15|1906|850|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|N|2,350|85,911|17,893|\n|Number of effect sizes (k)|2520|3231|10|\n\nCSR operationalization\n1.

Twenty effect sizes examined CSR by content analysis, but the corrected r is not significant (r = .0181, p = .4293). This result might be related to the problems of a methodological nature raised by Abbott and Monsen (1979). When content analysis is employed, it is necessary to formulate a set of categories and code the raw data in terms of the categories. Then, two types of problems are possible. First, the formulation of categories that do not reflect all the issues actually contained in the report. Second, the raw data may be inaccurately coded in terms of the selected categories (Abbott & Monsen, 1975). These shortcomings of content analysis might cause the differences in CSR measurements and facilitate the heterogenic relationship between CSR and CFP.\n\nFor 32 effect sizes using surveys, the corrected r is .1427 (p < .0001). This result indicated that the relationship measured by surveys is the largest effect. On one hand, it is because this method has the advantage of construct validity. On the other hand, the authors cannot deny the problem of common method bias overestimating the relationship.\n\nA growing number of studies examine CSR by using an independent social auditing database. The corrected r is equal to .0405 (p < .0001). The 10 effect sizes that rely on a proxy variable to assess CSR reveal a corrected r of .0372 (p < .0001). Taken together, these results suggest that the relationship between CSR and CFP is positive across all different kinds of measurement strategies.\n\nTable 3 indicates that the association between CSR and CFP depends on the researchers’ operational definition of CFP. Same as the procedure mentioned before, the authors conducted a QM test. The result shows a significant moderating effect of the CFP operationalization. QM = 115.4095 (p < .0001, df = 3) supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study manipulation. Across all the three measurement strategies, the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly positive. Particularly, the perceptual measures (r = .1852, p < .0001) are more highly correlated with CSR than accounting and market-based CFP. Seventy-one effect sizes collected financial data based on the accounting measurement, and the corrected r is equal to .0489 (p < .0001), which is a little bit higher than the market-based measurement (r = .0378, p < .0001).\n\nHypothesis 5 stated that the relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies. To test this predication, the authors separated the original studies into two categories: studies based on data obtained from advanced economies and studies based on data from developing economies. The authors\n\n# Moderating Effects of CFP Operationalization\n\n|Number of effect|k|size (78, 6612, 078)|N|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1. Accounting CFP|2. Market-based CFP|3.

The QM is equal to 51.5369 (p < .0001), presenting a significant moderating effect for this contingency factor. The studies’ results based on data from advanced economies yield stronger effect sizes than those obtained from developing economies (r = .0404 vs. r = .0175, respectively). Meanwhile, the statistical power is different between the developed and developing countries. For the studies based in the developing countries, the p value is significant at the level of .1. However, it is significant at the level of .\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
