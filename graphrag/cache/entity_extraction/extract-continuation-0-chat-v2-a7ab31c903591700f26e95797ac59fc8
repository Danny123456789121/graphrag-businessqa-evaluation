So, the second hypothesis can be accepted. The effect of green accounting with financial performance can be observed in terms of revenue and costs. Increased implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia can maximize revenue potential and increase efficiency in terms of costs. On the cost side, there are many benefits that companies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability.\n\n# 4.4. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance\n\nThe third hypothesis states that the implementation of CSMS can improve financial performance. The results showed a significance of 0.02 with a coefficient of 0.22, so that the hypothesis was accepted. This indicates that CSMS is able to create and maintain a condition, which can guarantee that a business can survive for a long time, so that it can lead to consumer and market loyalty so as to increase financial performance. When integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values.\n\nGA 8EU27 FF (RJi (P<.01) (RJIi B= 0222 R2_0.14 B=0.15 (Pz0.02) (P=O 01) CSMS (RJti R2_0.02\n\n# Figure 3: Research Results A\n\n# Table 2: Model fit and quality indices\n\n|Average path coefficient (APC)|0.212|P = 0.013|\n|---|---|---|\n|Average R-squared (ARS)|0.081|P = 0.118|\n|Average adjusted R-squared (AARS)|0.063|P = 0.145|\n|Average block VIF (AVIF)|1.027|acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3|\n|Average full collinearity VIF (AFVIF)|1.103|acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3|\n|Tenenhaus GoF (GoF)|0.285|small >= 0.1, medium >= 0.25, large >= 0.36|\n|Sympsonâ€™s paradox ratio (SPR)|1.000|acceptable if >= 0.7, ideally = 1|\n|R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR)|1.000|acceptable if >= 0.9, ideally = 1|\n|Statistical suppression ratio (SSR)|1.000|acceptable if >= 0.7|\n|Nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR)|0.833|acceptable if >= 0.7|\n\n# 5. Conclusions\n\nAllocation of environmental costs in green accounting through the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) is one of the strategic policies for manufacturing companies in Indonesia, so that it can improve financial performance, because it is related to company policies in allocating costs to environmental activities, investment, and funding. Therefore, the companyâ€™s decision to allocate environmental costs must be in line with consumer needs and consider the companyâ€™s capabilities.\n\nThe results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country, are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs and in accordance with their portion so as to improve financial performance either directly or indirectly. The public assesses that companies that have a good ranking in the company performance rating program in environmental management by the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment have good prospects for financial performance.\n\nManufacturing companies in Indonesia, whose production process is directly related to the environment and based on the results of research that the public highly assesses companies from the perspective of their environmental responsibility, can hope to continue to maintain and improve the planning and allocation of environmental costs in the production process. The government, in this case the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI), should make accounting policies and standards related to green accounting the companyâ€™s legal basis for accounting. This study only examined manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Future researchers should try to use other sector companies, so they can find out whether environmental issues can occur in all types of businesses.\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business\n\n# Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731â€“738\n\n# References\n\nAli, Q., Salman, A., Yaacob, H., Zaini, Z., & Abdullah, R.
