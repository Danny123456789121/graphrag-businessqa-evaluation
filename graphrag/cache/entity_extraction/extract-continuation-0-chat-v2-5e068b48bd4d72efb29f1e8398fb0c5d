The first test was proposed by Levin et al. (2002) (hereafter LLC). The null hypothesis of this test assumes that there is a common unit root process and the autoregressive coefficient is identical across cross-sections. Conversely, the second test developed by Im et al. (2003) (hereafter IPS) allows the autoregressive coefficient to vary across cross-sections. The third and fourth tests proposed by Maddala and Wu (1999) and Choi (2001) (hereafter ADF and PP) share the same assumption as for the IPS test. Given the heterogeneity in the sample, the IPS, ADF and PP tests are more relevant in this study. However, we put more emphasis on the IPS test as the sample meets its asymptotic requirements (numbers of cross-sections are larger than numbers of years). The test results show that all the variables are stationary except for GDP and energy intensity. However, the two series became stationary after taking first differences (see Table A.2 in Appendix A). Another benefit from first differencing is that it helps reduce or even remove serial correlation (Wooldridge, 2007). We applied the autocorrelation test proposed by Wooldridge (2002) and the heteroskedasticity test.\n\n# Table 7\n\nEstimation results for CO2 emission models (low-income group).\n\n|Variable|OLS (21)|FE (22)|PW (23)|FD (24)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Constant|− 16.906***|–|–|–|\n| |(−37.58)| | | |\n|lnP|1.258***|0.827***|0.980**|1.749**|\n| |(134.65)|(3.89)|(2.20)|(2.30)|\n|lnA|1.375***|1.831***|2.241***|2.498***|\n| |(24.47)|(19.96)|(15.80)|(6.42)|\n|lnIND|0.407***|0.294***|0.099*|0.029|\n| |(7.32)|(5.72)|(1.80)|(0.66)|\n|lnSV|1.206***|0.318***|0.036|−0.058|\n| |(13.85)|(4.45)|(0.63)|(−0.77)|\n|lnURB|0.494***|0.518***|0.615***|0.430**|\n| |(12.21)|(5.71)|(4.69)|(1.93)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>EVENT<|>The CO2 emission models are statistical models used to estimate the emissions of carbon dioxide across different income groups based on various economic indicators.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOW-INCOME GROUP<|>GEO<|>The low-income group refers to a classification of countries or regions with lower economic status, often analyzed in studies of CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGH-INCOME GROUP<|>GEO<|>The high-income group refers to a classification of countries or regions with higher economic status, often analyzed in studies of CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANEL DATA<|>EVENT<|>Panel data refers to data collected over time on the same subjects, allowing for the analysis of changes and trends in CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GDP PER CAPITA<|>EVENT<|>GDP per capita is an economic measure that represents the average economic output per person, often used in studies to analyze its impact on CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>URBANIZATION<|>EVENT<|>Urbanization refers to the increasing population in urban areas, which is often linked to higher CO2 emissions due to industrial and service activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDUSTRY GDP<|>EVENT<|>Industry GDP refers to the percentage of GDP that comes from industrial activities, which can influence CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICES GDP<|>EVENT<|>Services GDP refers to the percentage of GDP that comes from service activities, which can also impact CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOCORRELATION TEST<|>EVENT<|>The autocorrelation test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a correlation between the values of a variable over time, relevant in the context of CO2 emissions analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HETEROSCEDASTICITY TEST<|>EVENT<|>The heteroscedasticity test is a statistical test used to check if the variance of errors in a regression model is constant, important for validating CO2 emission models.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>LOW-INCOME GROUP<|>The CO2 emission models are specifically estimated for the low-income group to analyze their emissions patterns<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>HIGH-INCOME GROUP<|>The CO2 emission models are also estimated for the high-income group to compare emissions patterns<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDP PER CAPITA<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>GDP per capita is a variable used in the CO2 emission models to assess its impact on emissions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>URBANIZATION<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>Urbanization is a variable included in the CO2 emission models to evaluate its effect on emissions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDUSTRY GDP<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>Industry GDP is a factor in the CO2 emission models to analyze its contribution to emissions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICES GDP<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>Services GDP is considered in the CO2 emission models to understand its role in emissions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOCORRELATION TEST<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>The autocorrelation test is applied to the CO2 emission models to check for serial correlation in the data<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HETEROSCEDASTICITY TEST<|>CO2 EMISSION MODELS<|>The heteroscedasticity test is used in the context of CO2 emission models to ensure the validity of the regression results<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
