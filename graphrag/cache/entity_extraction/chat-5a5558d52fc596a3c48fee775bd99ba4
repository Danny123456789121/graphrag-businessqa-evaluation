This study investigated the effect of GSV on GPPO, EGC, and EEP by focusing on company staff and using psychological ownership (PO) theory and expected price theory. We used the obtained findings to fill the research gap on EGC issues in corporate sustainability research. This study proposes a comprehensive conceptual structure to explore the effect of company members’ psychological processes regarding the company’s green issues on the company’s green management performance.\n\n# Figure 1. Integrated conceptual structure.\n\n|Psychological Processes of Green Issues|Green Management Performance|\n|---|---|\n|Motivation|Green Employee Behavior and Performance|\n|Green Shared Vision|Green Employee Confusion|\n|Green Product Psychology|Employee Environmental Performance|\n|Psychological Ownership| |\n\n# 2. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development\n\n# 2.1. Negative Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC)\n\nGiven the global trend of concern for environmental issues, existing strict environmental regulations, and customers’ perception of the environment, companies must develop suitable legal strategies to gain valuable resources [27, 28]. A collective strategic direction can be encapsulated in a shared vision, which guides company members’ actions according to a certain approach [29]. A shared vision can also be used to encourage corporate employees to exhibit excellent performance [30]. A shared vision is a key aspect of strategic management for a company because it indicates the unique objective, general direction, and practices of the company [31]. The method used by an organization to develop a shared vision has become the primary focus of environmental management research. The concept of GSV is defined on the basis of environmental friendliness and sustainable development [24]. Managers establish clear and common environmental goals for future organizational development, which enables the organization to supervise the green behavior and performance of employees as well as minimize EGC.\n\nStaff confusion may occur when a company provides excessively similar, excessively complex, or an excessive amount of product or service information regarding SDGs. The larger the amount of information processed by an individual, the higher is their likelihood of experiencing information overload [32]. Information overload creates confusion [33], and EGC may affect a company’s SDGs. This research refers to the definition of EGC provided by Chen and Chang [18], who stated that EGC refers to employees’ inability to correctly understand the environmental characteristics of their company’s products and services as well as the characteristics of its environmental policy during information processing. Therefore, companies must formulate a clear green common vision and effectively obtain employee recognition to encourage the green behavior and performance of employees [24, 34, 35]. GSV can encourage the green behavior and performance of employees, effectively develop employee recognition, and eliminate EGC. GSV is negatively related to EGC. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1). GSV is negatively associated with EGC.\n\n# 2.2. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)\n\nCurrently, many companies are facing challenges caused by the rise of global environmental awareness, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and increasing consumer environmental awareness. To ensure that valuable resources are obtained legally, an organization must formulate a suitable legal strategy [27, 28]. A carefully planned and designed company vision facilitates employees’ actions and decisions and inspires them to move toward a shared vision [36]. A shared vision is a common future goal set by an organization’s manager for the development of the organization. It conveys the norms and beliefs of the company to members. A shared vision can motivate employees to perform [30] and exceed expectations related to their work performance [34].\n\nWhen an organization proactively performs environmental actions, its long-term goals with respect to corporate greening are conveyed to its staff [37]. Environmental improvement performance depends on whether a shared vision exists between staff and managers, especially when environmental strategies require intensive staff engagement [38]. Above all, the process of combining corporate environmental performance and strategy is profoundly affected by the shared vision [39]. A shared vision can reduce the adverse effects caused by senior team members setting different goals and having conflicting views [40, 41]. Moreover, such a vision can prevent the fragmentation of a team.\n\nTeam members must establish a shared vision, and continual interaction, practice, and reflection can improve team performance [42]. With regard to EEP, organization managers can influence green purchasing behavior [43], promote environmental market-oriented strategies [44], and encourage\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\nemployees to have a responsible attitude toward environmental issues [ 45 ]. Organizations should always encourage members who possess good intentions, especially those who adopt a responsible attitude toward environmental issues. This step would enable employees to perform responsible actions when environmental problems arise.\n\nEmployees play an important role in promoting green management in an enterprise. Paillé and Meija-Morelos [ 46 ] defined EEP as the performance of employees’ compliance with company norms, and their interaction and communication based on personal environmental knowledge to relevant stakeholders. Expectancy–valence theory is a cognitive motivation theory that connects the energy of an individual’s motivation or willingness to strive for goals and expectations and obtain the expected value of the incentives to a specific purpose [47].\n\nAccording to expectancy–valence theory, the choice, performance, and continuity of organization members’ achievement behaviors are affected by expectations and values [48], which results in individuals investing increased efforts to obtain expected values [49 ]. When a company develops a suitable GSV, the GSV motivates employees to strive for goals and values that contribute to employee behavior. Related research has indicated that a shared vision is crucial for enhancing employee environmental behavior [24,34,35,50]. Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed:\n\n# Hypothesis 2 (H2). GSV is positively associated\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
