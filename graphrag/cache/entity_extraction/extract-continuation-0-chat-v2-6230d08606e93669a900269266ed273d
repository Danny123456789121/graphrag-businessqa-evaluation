However, until recently, no standard procedure with comparable rigor to first-order meta-analytical approaches had emerged. This paper makes use of the novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis proposed by Schmidt and Oh (2013).\n\nWe contribute to the academic inquiry on the CSP-CFP relation in several regards. By summarizing the findings of existing meta-analyses and utilizing a data sample that is more than 25 times larger compared to the average of previous studies, we are able to generate fairly robust results. Not only do we demonstrate that the main findings of Orlitzky and colleagues still hold today, but our results deliver more unequivocal and comprehensive conclusions. The highly significant, positive, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation varies in magnitude depending on different CSP dimensions and CFP categories, but effect sizes are less variable than expected. Surprisingly, the relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key aspect. We highlight that a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation exists when operational CFP is considered. Furthermore, we conclude that shrinking CSP-CFP correlations in meta-analyses over time can be ascribed to more sophisticated research methods and are not observable at primary study level. Finally, we address potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: we show that social issues-oriented and lower-impact journals as well as methodological weaker papers do not distort the CSP-CFP relation. The practical relevance of our second-order meta-analysis is: the business case for being a good firm is undeniable.\n\n# Hypotheses\n\nTheoretical arguments support a positive, negative, as well as neutral CSP-CFP relation. Arguments supporting a positive CSP-CFP relation are typically rooted in stakeholder theory (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Freeman, 1984), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), or draw on the industrial organization literature (Porter, 1979). When arguing for a negative CSP-CFP relation, scholars usually refer to Levitt’s (1958) or Friedman’s (1962, 1970) logic of social responsibility of the firm to solely increase its profits. Moreover, arguments based on portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952, 1959) point towards disadvantageous limitations for portfolio construction when picking stocks following a CSP filter. Finally, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970, 1991) argue for a neutral – or at least non-exploitable – relation of CSP and CFP, as all information is priced at any time by the market. This also includes potentially business-relevant CSP information.\n\nNext to these differing theoretical perspectives, the empirical CSP-CFP debate to date faces several questions. Even though considerable primary research has been conducted, it still remains less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and whether the business case holds as well for different measures of CFP. Eventually, questions of robustness and moderating effects arise which need to be answered in order to derive.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

This paper seeks to answer some of these questions.\n\n# The general CSP-CFP Relation\n\n# Direction of the CSP-CFP\n\nIn the academic literature, to date, the business case for CSP seems to be increasingly accepted and empirically supported (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Eccles, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Flammer, 2015). In line with the outcomes of previous research that summarized large numbers of primary research (e.g. Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003) we, thus, propose:\n\nH1a: CSP and CFP are generally positively related across a wide variety of study designs.\n\n# Causality of the CSP-CFP Relation\n\nNext to the general CSP-CFP relation, the subsequent question pertains to the causality of this relation. Proponents of good management theory (Waddock & Graves, 1997) argue that prior good CSP leads subsequently to better CFP. The opposite explanation is the slack resources theory (Cyert & March, 1963; J. B. McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), where excess financial resources of a company are seen as a necessary condition in order to reinvest and, thus, counter threats or exploit opportunities (Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, & Turner, 2004). Following this view, prior superior CFP leads subsequently to improved CSP. As both theories found theoretical and empirical support, a common argument is that there exists a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP – they seem to be related reciprocally and concurrently (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Waddock & Graves, 1997). We follow this line of thought and thus expect:\n\nH1b: The causality of the CSP-CFP relation is bidirectional.\n\n# The Relation of various CSP Dimensions and CFP\n\n# Corporate Environmental Performance\n\nSince the first\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to the practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on the world, including social and environmental aspects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) measures a company's financial health and profitability, often evaluated through metrics such as revenue, profit margins, and return on investment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHMIDT AND OH<|>PERSON<|>Schmidt and Oh proposed a novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis in their 2013 paper, contributing to the academic inquiry on the relationship between Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky is a researcher whose findings on the CSP-CFP relation are referenced in the paper, indicating that their conclusions remain relevant today.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALDSON AND PRESTON<|>PERSON<|>Donaldson and Preston are theorists whose stakeholder theory supports a positive CSP-CFP relation, suggesting that good corporate practices can lead to better financial outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREEMAN<|>PERSON<|>Freeman is a theorist associated with stakeholder theory, which posits that companies should consider the interests of all stakeholders in their operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROLL AND SHABANA<|>PERSON<|>Carroll and Shabana are researchers who have contributed to the understanding of the business case for Corporate Social Performance (CSP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS<|>EVENT<|>Ecological aspects refer to the environmental considerations that companies may focus on as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL ASPECTS<|>EVENT<|>Social aspects refer to the societal considerations that companies may focus on as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLISHING SOURCE BIAS<|>EVENT<|>Publishing source bias refers to the potential distortion in research findings based on the type of journals where studies are published, which can affect the perceived relationship between CSP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECOND-ORDER META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Second-order meta-analysis is a method of analyzing existing meta-analyses to derive broader conclusions about a research topic, as proposed by Schmidt and Oh in 2013.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is believed to positively influence Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), indicating a relationship between good corporate practices and financial success.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHMIDT AND OH<|>SECOND-ORDER META-ANALYSIS<|>Schmidt and Oh's proposal for second-order meta-analysis contributes to understanding the CSP-CFP relationship by analyzing existing studies.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>Orlitzky's findings support the notion that Corporate Social Responsibility is positively related to Corporate Financial Performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALDSON AND PRESTON<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>Donaldson and Preston's stakeholder theory provides a theoretical basis for the positive relationship between Corporate Social Performance and Corporate Financial Performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREEMAN<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>Freeman's stakeholder theory aligns with the idea that good corporate practices can lead to better financial outcomes, supporting the CSP-CFP relationship.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARROLL AND SHABANA<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>Carroll and Shabana's research reinforces the business case for Corporate Social Responsibility, suggesting it positively impacts Corporate Financial Performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLISHING SOURCE BIAS<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>Publishing source bias can affect the perceived relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Financial Performance, indicating a potential distortion in research findings.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
