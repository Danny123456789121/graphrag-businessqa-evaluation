Moreover, the standard deviation in carbon emission growth rates is very stable over time. In particular, the standard deviation did not significantly change following the addition of new firms to the sample in 2015.\n\n12 Some firms in this table are classified into multiple industries; hence, the total number of firms in the table (3917) exceeds the number of unique firms in our sample (3421).\n\nOur empirical analysis of stock returns employs a monthly measure of returns as a dependent variable. In our cross-sectional return regressions, the dependent variable RETi,t is the monthly return of an individual stock i in month t. Our return data primarily comes from FactSet, but for a small subset of delisted firms, we replace the return data with delisting-adjusted values from Compustat. Finally, we remove observations with returns greater than 100% to mitigate the impact of outliers. The number of excluded firm/month observations is 109 and its exclusion does not materially affect our results. However, using unrestricted returns data would be problematic as the data, for example, include four observations with monthly returns greater than 10,000%.\n\nOur control variables are defined as follows: LOGSIZEi,t is the natural logarithm of firm i’s market capitalization (price times shares outstanding) at the end of year t; B/Mi,t is firm i’s book value divided by its market capitalization at the end of year t; LEVERAGE is the book leverage of the company; ROEi,t is the firm’s earnings performance, given by the ratio of firm i’s net yearly income divided by the value of its equity; MOMi,t is the average of the most recent 12 months’ returns on stock i, leading up to and including month t-1; INVEST/A represents the firm’s capital expenditures divided by the book value of its assets; HHI is the Herfindahl concentration index of firms with respect to different business segments, based on each segment’s revenues; LOGPPE is the natural logarithm of the firm’s property, plant, and equipment; BETAi,t is the market beta of firm i in year t, calculated over the one year period using daily data; VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of returns based on the past 12 months of monthly returns; SALESGRi,t is the dollar change in annual firm revenues normalized by last month’s market capitalization; EPSGRi,t is the dollar change in annual earnings per share, normalized by the firm’s equity price. To eliminate the impact of outliers, we winsorize B/M, LEVERAGE, and INVEST/A at the 2.5% level, and MOM, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR at the 0.5% level. We report the summary statistics of these variables in Panel B of Table 1.\n\nThe average firm’s monthly stock return is 1.14%, with a standard deviation of 10.84%. The average firm has a market capitalization of $13 billion, with a median value of $3.8 billion. The average book-to-market ratio is 0.50, while the average book leverage is 24%. The average market beta is 1.10, slightly more than that of the market.\n\n# 2.3. Variables in the time series return regressions\n\nThe variables for our time series regressions are defined as follows: MKTRFt is the monthly return of the CRSP value-weighted portfolio in month t, net of the risk-free rate; SMB, HML, MOM, and CMAt are well-known portfolio return series downloaded from Ken French’s website: SMB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on small stocks and short on large stocks; HML is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high book-to-market stocks and short on low book-to-market stocks; MOM is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on past one-year return winners and short on past one-year return losers; CMA is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on conservative investment stocks and short on aggressive investment stocks. BAB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low-beta stocks and short on high-beta stocks; LIQ is the liquidity factor of Pastor and Stambaugh; NET ISSUANCE is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high-net-issuance stocks and short on low-net-issuance stocks. Net issuance for year t is the change in the natural log of split-adjusted shares outstanding from the fiscal yearend in t-2 to the fiscal yearend in t-1; IDIO VOL is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. We present the summary statistics for the various portfolio returns in Panel C of Table 1.\n\nThe average market risk premium in our sample is 0.7% per month. Other factors with relatively high risk premia are net issuance and BAB. Somewhat atypically, the value factor return in our sample is equal to 0%. Similarly, the momentum factor generates a mere 0.07% per month, and the volatility factor has a negative return of -0.18% per month.\n\n# 2.4. Variables in divestment regressions\n\nOur institutional ownership regression variables are: IOi,t, which is the fraction of the shares of company i held by institutions in the FactSet database at the end of year t. IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions.\n\nat the end of the year, and then dividing this value by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year. We further decompose the institutional ownership with respect to subgroups of owners. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FACTSET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FactSet is a financial data and software company that provides information and analytics to financial professionals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUSTAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Compustat is a database of financial, statistical, and market information on active and inactive global companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRSP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) provides historical stock market data and is widely used in financial research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEN FRENCH<|>PERSON<|>Ken French is a finance professor known for his work on asset pricing and portfolio management, particularly in relation to the Fama-French three-factor model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET<|>EVENT<|>The market refers to the overall economic environment where securities are bought and sold, influenced by various factors including stock returns and market risk premiums.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP<|>EVENT<|>Institutional ownership refers to the percentage of a company's shares that are owned by institutions, which can influence stock performance and corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTSET<|>COMPUSTAT<|>FactSet and Compustat both provide financial data and analytics, serving similar markets in the finance industry<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRSP<|>FACTSET<|>CRSP provides historical stock market data that is often used in conjunction with data from FactSet<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEN FRENCH<|>CRSP<|>Ken French's research often utilizes data from CRSP for empirical analysis in finance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP<|>FACTSET<|>FactSet tracks institutional ownership data, providing insights into the shares held by institutions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP<|>COMPUSTAT<|>Compustat includes data on institutional ownership, which is relevant for analyzing stock performance<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
