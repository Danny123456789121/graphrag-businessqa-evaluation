We also enhanced our drying system.” (Supplier A)\n\nAdopting the shared virtues, Plan Creation has contributed to the community it operates in different ways. This contribution helps the surrounding community to understand Plan Creation better. Such enhanced understanding helps to prevent a problem such as protesting stemmed from the surrounding community.\n\n“We have regularly organized CSR activities. We promote a reforestation campaign with the community. We also regularly organize a reforestation activity every year by involving people in the community. We act as a role model for people in our community.” (Plant Manager)\n\n“The strength of the company in relation to community is the environmental concern. The company cooperates with the surrounding community. For example, the company provides a health checkup for people who live near the factory. In any special event, like Children’s day, Elderly’s day, the company also organizes activities for the community.” (Employee)\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n“We arrange “Toy Museum” in which visitors can visit all year long. Especially during the Children’s day, PlanToys organizes many activities for children in the community to join.” (Marketing Officer)\n\nIn terms of social responsibility value, Thai traditions and culture are regarded as critical in lifting employees’ morale. Plan Creation has conducted traditional and religious ceremonies regularly for this purpose. In addition, local traditional and cultural activities are supported by the company, such as merit-making ceremonies or cremation services. Employees are also allowed to schedule their work so that they can leave to attend such ceremonies. Such a practice obviously leads to improving social and cultural outputs.\n\n“Another activity is a meditation program that we open for all employees to join.” (HR Officer)\n\n# 5.2. Measurable Outputs\n\nOutputs from applying the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in an organization can be classified into four important groups: economic output, environmental output, and social and cultural outputs [3].\n\nIn terms of economic outputs, Plan Creation has demonstrated continuous growth in performance. The company has continued to provide sustainable returns for shareholders and stakeholders with an increasing rate from 2013 to 2017. According to the public data from the Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce, Thailand, Plan Creation was the leader with the highest market share in its industry between 2013 and 2017. The average total income over that period was 379.6 Million THB, which was better than those top three competitors in the same industry (158.8 million, 121.6 million, 83.4 million THB). The five-year average net profit of Plan Creation was also the highest in the industry, i.e., 5.3 million THB, compared with those top three competitors in the same industry (3.7 million, 0.78 million, −5.2 million). The company has also improved operational efficiency. For example, the company reduced its production cost by approximately 10 percent in 2017 by relocating its factory to a southern province of Thailand close to the source of raw materials (e.g., rubberwood).\n\nIn terms of environmental outputs, the company can bring about lower waste emissions. It can also reduce the ratio of real wood usage by 32%. Subsequently, the use of wood chips helps to reduce waste emission even further. Table 4 below compares the proportion and cost of raw materials of the company.\n\n**Table 4. Comparison of raw materials by proportion and cost.**\n|Raw Materials|Proportion of Real Wood|Cost (THB)/Kilogram|\n|---|---|---|\n|Plan wood|68%|13.75|\n|Real wood|100%|20.13|\n\nMoreover, carbon emission was also reduced significantly. The company has continuously collected data about the carbon emission rate since 2012. The carbon emission rate of the company was reduced from 2747.1 carbon ton in 2012 to 2140.5 carton ton in 2013. This is considered a more than 20% reduction rate. After real wood was replaced by Plan wood, the ratio of carbon was reduced by 53.75% as demonstrated in Table 5.\n\n**Table 5. Raw materials and carbon emission of Planwood.**\n|Raw Materials|Number of Tree Used Per Year|Carbon Emission Per Year (Carbon kilogram)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Plan wood|1746|68,110|\n|Real wood|808|31,500|\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n# 5.3. Envisaged Outcomes\n\nPlan Creation relies on its own process of the supply chain. Starting with raw materials, the company uses local rubberwood from rubberwood trees in the southern part, which can no longer produce latex. It does not rely on imported materials or energy from overseas countries. The company emphasizes and also utilizes its core competency, which is product design. With its unique designs, Plan Creation has developed a strong brand identity for its own. Lastly, the company also has devised its own manufacturing processes. With unique designs, manufacturing processes and brand identity, it is difficult for competitors to imitate.\n\nPlan Creation has demonstrated its organizational immunity. The company can survive the global financial crisis in 2007 by maintaining a gross profit at 6%, during which time its competitors were not profitable. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pan Creation is not affected while other businesses in Thailand have been on the decline.\n\n“We are not affected by the pandemic. As a matter of facts, our sales volume increases because we invested in building overseas factories and online channels.” (Managing Director)\n\nLastly, the company has demonstrated its organizational resilience via several crises. Notably, it could bound back from the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis within 3–4 years, while other companies could not survive.\n\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLAN CREATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plan Creation is a company that engages in community contributions, organizes CSR activities, and emphasizes environmental sustainability through various initiatives, including reforestation campaigns and health checkups for local residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAILAND<|>GEO<|>Thailand is the country where Plan Creation operates, utilizing local rubberwood and emphasizing sustainability in its manufacturing processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that affected many businesses, but Plan Creation reported an increase in sales volume during this period due to strategic investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1997 ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS<|>EVENT<|>The 1997 Asian Economic Crisis was a financial crisis that impacted many companies, but Plan Creation managed to recover within 3-4 years while others failed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGING DIRECTOR<|>PERSON<|>The Managing Director of Plan Creation oversees the company's operations and strategic decisions, including responses to crises and market changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE<|>PERSON<|>An employee at Plan Creation who contributes to the company's community engagement and CSR activities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLAN CREATION<|>THAILAND<|>Plan Creation operates within Thailand, utilizing local resources and contributing to the community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLAN CREATION<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Plan Creation's sales volume increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to strategic investments in overseas factories and online channels<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLAN CREATION<|>1997 ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS<|>Plan Creation successfully recovered from the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis while many competitors did not<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANAGING DIRECTOR<|>PLAN CREATION<|>The Managing Director is responsible for overseeing Plan Creation's operations and strategic responses to market challenges<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPLOYEE<|>PLAN CREATION<|>Employees at Plan Creation engage in community activities and contribute to the company's CSR initiatives<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
