Total number of incidents of socially irresponsible behavior: n = 2,161.\n\nTable 3 numbered 3,4,16,19,20,22,24,26, and 27. Because Studies 16, 22, 24, and 26 all had sample sizes above 100, this was a reasonable change to have made. The conversion of zS into ts for Studies 3 and 19 was a bit more tenuous because these studies had sample sizes of 49 and 32, respectively. And because the conversion for Studies 4, 20, and 27 (with sample sizes of 17, 10, and 5) was even more questionable, the statistical tests were run with a sample of 18 (all the studies using t statistics originally) and with a sample of 22 (the 18 studies that used ts plus the 4 studies that had used zs but had samples of over 100). The results of these runs were almost identical to the results of the full sample of 27 and are reported in the Results section below:\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\nThree of the studies (5,15,23) reported p values, but not ts O zs. The pS were converted into ts by using a t table and the appropriate degrees of freedom: Studies 15 and 23 did not give exact p values and instead merely indicated that the data were significant at a Type I error rate of less than .05 and .01, respectively. For these two studies, t values were taken off the student's t table by assuming the pS were exactly .05 and .01.\n\nIn short, ts could be obtained for each study, and these ts became the metric on which all the statistical analyses were based, as will be explained in the Analysis section below.\n\n# Why size-of-return data cannot be used\n\nBesides producing test statistics, event studies also produce size-of-return data. Davidson and Worrell (1992), for example, showed that during the 3 days surrounding their event (nonautomobile recalls), firms lost on average .0238 of their value: In other words, the average abnormal size-of-return was a negative 2.39.\n\nAlthough intuitively it might seem reasonable to base the meta-analysis on such size-of-return data, such an analysis cannot be done for two reasons. First, about one third of event studies only compute average abnormal returns (AARs), another third compute only cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs), and about a third compute both. Therefore, meta-analyzing size-of-return data would clearly lead to complications because AARs and CAARs are different metrics for measuring returns.\n\nSecond, in meta-analyzing size-of-return data one would need to standardize the returns by their standard deviations (Rosenthal, 1994). Unfortunately, almost no event studies report these standard deviations. For these reasons, then, the meta-analysis had to be performed on the test statistics.\n\nIn addition, because of these problems with size-of-return data, this study did not use the replication method of meta-analysis. The replication method was used by the only other known meta-analysis of event studies (Datta, Pinches, and Narayanan, 1992). In that meta-analysis, the authors used a regression model with size-of-return data as their dependent variable. However, as just noted, because the size-of-return data collected for this meta-analysis come in two different metrics, the possibility of them being used as a variable in this study is precluded. The method of meta-analysis that this article does use is explained below.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThis article makes use of a direct weighted linear combination of estimators method of meta-analysis, developed by Hedges and Olkin (1985). They developed a testing procedure for a fixed-effects categorical data.\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>The Frooman Meta-Analysis is a study that compiles and analyzes various event studies to assess the impact of events on firm value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVIDSON AND WORRELL<|>PERSON<|>Davidson and Worrell conducted a study in 1992 that reported on the average loss of firm value during nonautomobile recalls.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEDGES AND OLKIN<|>PERSON<|>Hedges and Olkin developed a method of meta-analysis used in the Frooman Meta-Analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAS SAGEPUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bas Sagepub is the publisher from which the Frooman Meta-Analysis was downloaded.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT STUDIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Event studies are research methodologies that analyze the impact of specific events on stock prices and firm value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIZE-OF-RETURN DATA<|>EVENT<|>Size-of-return data refers to metrics that measure the abnormal returns of firms surrounding specific events.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVIDSON AND WORRELL<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>Davidson and Worrell's study is referenced in the Frooman Meta-Analysis as an example of event study findings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEDGES AND OLKIN<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>The meta-analysis utilizes the method developed by Hedges and Olkin for its statistical analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAS SAGEPUB<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>The Frooman Meta-Analysis was published by Bas Sagepub<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENT STUDIES<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>The Frooman Meta-Analysis compiles findings from various event studies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIZE-OF-RETURN DATA<|>FROOMAN META-ANALYSIS<|>The Frooman Meta-Analysis discusses the limitations of using size-of-return data in its analysis<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
