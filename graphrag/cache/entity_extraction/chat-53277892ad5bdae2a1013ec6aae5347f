An attempt is made to identify relevant evaluation criteria including sustainability aspects. This research work proposes a combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN framework for selecting the best sustainable supplier. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is an original effort in evaluating the suppliers in a real sustainable supply chain network based on the combination of these powerful techniques.\n\n# 3. The AHP-DEMATEL-BN Approach\n\nThe contextual setting of this study is determining whether a supplier is a good partner for an organization, taking into consideration economic, environmental and social dimensions with uncertainties and limited information. Therefore, we propose a hydride approach based on AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods. Furthermore, the reasons and complementarities for combining AHP-DEMATEL-BN in this study include:\n\n- AHP evaluates the decision problems hierarchically by decomposing the complex problem into simpler subproblems, while the DEMATEL approach effectively evaluates decision-makersâ€™ priorities at an initial level of decision-making. The supplier selection problem is decomposed to three goal levels, sustainable aspects and criteria. The importance weights of each sustainability dimension for decision makers are calculated using AHP. Then, these weights are integrated into a BN model.\n- AHP does not consider relations among the evaluation criteria and assumes that they are independent. DEMATELâ€™s complementarity deals with this issue. Using DEMATEL, the causal relations among the evaluation criteria are analyzed and the initial causal graph is proposed to build the BN model.\n- AHP and DEMATEL cannot be used alone as a decision-making tool to explicitly evaluate uncertainties and limited information. However, BNs have dominant properties for making probabilistic calculations despite the unknown information for some evaluation criteria.\n- By combining AHP, DEMATEL and BN, we model the sustainable supplier performance from both short-term and long-term viewpoints.\n\nThe proposed hybrid AHP-DEMATEL-BN approach is organized into five main steps as summarized in Figure 1.\n\nThus, we demonstrate an example depicted from a practical, real-life case problem in order to illustrate and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The situation discussed here is faced by an actual international manufacturing company.\n\nThe company has one site in France. It manufactures innovative industrial products for business clients by working on reducing water and energy consumption. It is a pioneering innovator in environmental approaches; it was recognized as a leader in environmental protection by the United States Agency for Environmental Protection and has been ISO14001 certified since 1997, with one of the earliest certifications in the world.\n\nThe manufacturing company wishes to evaluate its current and potential suppliers before choosing them for partnering. The company considers key factors affecting the sourcing functional efficiencies. The supplier is also evaluated and chosen using various sustainability criteria as part of the strategic organizational goal\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
