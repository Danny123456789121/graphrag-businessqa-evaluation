The organizational impacts of these factors vary whether they are internal or external, specific or transversal (Lozano, 2015). Examples of internal factors commonly refer leadership, strategies, culture, environmental precaution, risk mitigation, and transparency; as external factors, it is common to see negative publicity, stakeholders pressures, regulations and legislation, and the rising of general social awareness (Lozano & von Haartman, 2018). All these factors are dynamic and depend on the organization's size, structure, and activity sector (Engert & Baumgartner, 2016).\n\nFor organizations that have successfully IS issues, sustainability management demands the verification of the scope and impact of organizational changes, as well as the assessment of how the organization is effectively handling its processes and interacting with relevant stakeholders (Doppelt, 2010). For these purposes, it is important to identify not only key internal or external factors but also transversal key factors, common to other organizations. This allows the contextual understanding of possible interactivities between awareness, implementation, measurement, and communication processes, promoting facilitating activities in order to overcome sustainability barriers.\n\nPrevious research on these issues highlights the need to develop management models with ability to integrate CS and therefore to enable value co-creation dynamics (Aquilani et al., 2018). The lack of sustainability intelligence leads to reactive and mechanical responses to stakeholder pressures. The absence of a critical and strategical analysis of possible approaches increases the risk of uncertainties regarding possible actions to implement, which hinder the effective integration of sustainability and its associated benefits. Consequently, organizational impact of sustainability-oriented actions is not recognized as “expansion of wealth-welfare-well-being all around” by adopting a “win more–win more” approach, as referred by (Ramaswamy & Ozcan, 2014; p. 31).\n\nBased on literature, the present research assumes organizations as non-homogeneous entities, characterized and differentiated by specific dynamics. Their understanding and operationalization of the ISI will define a framework that reflects their perception degree on different factors.\n\n# 2.1 Business models for sustainability\n\nThe study of business models has an increasing relevance in CS management. Business models provide a systematic analysis and perspective on how an organization operates and does its businesses, enabling the adequate delineation, observation, implementation, and modification of practices and procedures in different strategic and operational stages (Zott, Amit et al. 2011; Muñoz-Torres, Fernández-Izquierdo, Rivera-Lirio, & Escrig-Olmedo, 2019).\n\nBusiness models can be defined as “value propositions” that an organization presents to its customers, reflecting the methodologies used to manage its resources in order to create and sustain value over time (Muñoz-Torres et al., 2019).\n\nLiterature review shows different approaches and typologies regarding business models, applied to different sectors and economic activities. However, the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions in the study of business models has only taken place recently (Geissdoerfer, Vladimirova, & Evans, 2018).\n\nThe adoption and transformation of business models in the context of organizational sustainability depend on the organization's objectives regarding the TBL dimensions (Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund, & Hansen, 2016). Organizations have different value propositions with different levels of objectives, which implies the existence of different structural business models (Demil & Lecocq, 2010). Therefore, business models must be aligned with the global strategic objectives defined by the organization.\n\nSustainable business models should be considered under the scope of a dynamic and permanent interaction system requiring the intervention of multiple stakeholders and the use of diverse resources to develop and provide products and services, taking into account the adequate balance and equity of the TBL dimensions (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011).\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\nThe context in which organizations operate is not stable, with frequent changes and uncertainties that cannot be completely controlled (Ragsdell, 2000). Organizations promote initiatives involving autonomous measures, promoting synergies and/or complementarities, which will lead to different results and impacts depending on the specific issues under consideration (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, Amaro, & Leal Filho, 2015). This indicates that there is no unique or best answer regarding CS but rather a converging view to a given outcome (Rauter, Jonker, & Baumgartner, 2017).\n\nThe focus nowadays is not the product itself but rather a whole set of functional services associated with it, composing its life cycle. The organizational understanding of this cycle (including its economic, environmental, and social impacts) inevitably conditions stakeholder perceptions regarding value propositions, value creation, and value capture and is essential for the adequate organizational orientation towards sustainability.\n\n# 3 | METHODOLOGY\n\nThis study was based on exploratory qualitative research methodology, which is adequate for the development of new explanations regarding how different factors relate with each other, enhancing new approaches and theories regarding a specific segment of reality (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
