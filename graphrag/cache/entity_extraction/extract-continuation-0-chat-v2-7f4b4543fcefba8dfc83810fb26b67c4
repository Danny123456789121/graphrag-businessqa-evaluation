CSR can thus prove instrumental for sensing changes or threats, as stakeholders may transmit early-warning signs to managers (Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Volkswagen’s emission-scandal, for example, was partly caused by its authoritative corporate culture, which made employees afraid of questioning targets or sharing bad news with their superiors (Cremer & Bergin, 2015). Had Volkswagen fostered open and collaborative relationships with its employees, these problems might have been resolved before materializing into a costly public scandal. Thus, stakeholder relationships enable firms to anticipate and prevent foreseeable risks (Klassen & Vereecke, 2012; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016; Porter & Kramer, 2007).\n\nLower firm-specific risk creates value not because it directly generates higher CFP, but because it helps to preserve it (Choi & Wang, 2009; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Being implied in misconduct exposes firms to direct legal expenses such as litigation costs, administrative fines, and criminal sanctions, but also to indirect expenses such as turnover of key personnel, refinancing costs, and forgone sales (Karpoff & Lott, 1993; Koh et al., 2014). Because CSR firms are able to identify threats early on and correct potentially illegal acts, they can prevent these costs (Mcguire et al., 1988; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). In sum, firms that engage in CSR are more risk-aware, allowing them to manage and mitigate these risks.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nmore effectively. Lower firm-specific risk, in turn, reduces the likelihood that firms incur unproductive costs that burden CFP. Hence:\n\n# Hypothesis 3:\n\nThe CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by firm risk: CSR is negatively related to firm risk, and firm risk is negatively related to CFP.\n\n# The improved innovation capacity mechanism\n\nScholars have long recognized the potential of CSR to be a lever of innovation and competitive differentiation (Husted & Salazar, 2006; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Because firms that engage in CSR tend to adopt a broader perspective and develop closer relationships with stakeholders, they are better able to identify new opportunities (Harrison et al., 2010; Tantalo & Priem, 2016). Close relationships with external stakeholders such as local communities, customers, and environmental groups for example, offer new knowledge pools that can become an important source of innovation (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Hart, 1995; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Good relationships with internal stakeholders are also important for innovation. Employees may be more willing to share information with the firm (Aragón-Correa, Martín-Tapia, & Hurtado-Torres, 2013; Harrison et al., 2010), and be better able to overcome the sort of short-term orientation that tends to impede innovation (Flammer & Kacperczyk, 2016; Wang & Bansal, 2012).\n\nAnother reason why CSR may enhance the firm’s innovativeness is that the adoption of many CSR activities requires the development of existing innovation capabilities or triggers the creation of new capabilities. The extent of a firm’s absorptive capacity (Delmas, Hoffmann, & Kuss, 2011; Luo & Du, 2015) and presence of complementary assets (Christmann, 2000), for example, facilitate the successful implementation of CSR. Researchers have established that firms adopting proactive environmental strategies tend to engage in higher-order learning and continuous innovation (Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998).\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nwhich may result in the development of new dynamic capabilities (Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003). Danone, a food products multinational, offers an illustrative example. Since the early 2000s the firm has been launching base of the pyramid projects in rural areas of developing countries. These initiatives were an important source of strategic renewal, as it encouraged experimentation and learning within Danone, and allowed it to develop unique expertise in creating low-cost solutions (Faivre-Tavignot & Dalsace, 2014).\n\nThe relationships between innovation, absorptive capacity, and CFP are well established in the strategy literature (Tsai, 2001; Zahra & George, 2002), but there is increasing evidence for the presence of these relationships in the CSR context as well (Delmas et al., 2011; Tang, Hull, & Rothenberg, 2012). Innovations resulting from a firm’s engagement with stakeholders can enhance CFP in at least three ways. First, CSR offers a powerful means of product differentiation (Flammer, 2015b; Hull & Rothenberg, 2008; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Siegel & Vitaliano, 2007). Second, radical process innovations, especially in the context of environmental management, may reduce both waste and production costs (Christmann, 2000; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand & Romi, 2013; King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Finally, as illustrated by the Danone example, CSR initiatives may lead to new business models and offer completely new sources of value creation (Hart & Christensen, 2002; Hart & Sharma, 2004).
