It is a pioneering innovator in environmental approaches; it was recognized as a leader in environmental protection by the United States Agency for Environmental Protection and has been ISO14001 certified since 1997, with one of the earliest certifications in the world.\n\nThe manufacturing company wishes to evaluate its current and potential suppliers before choosing them for partnering. The company considers key factors affecting the sourcing functional efficiencies. The supplier is also evaluated and chosen using various sustainability criteria as part of the strategic organizational goal to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, the company has two suppliers, identified as S1 and S2. It has also another potential supplier, S3.\n\nThe study was conducted between September 2019 and February 2020. We started by a face-to-face meeting with different managers including a purchasing manager (DM1), a logistics manager (DM2) and a supply chain director (DM3) in the company under study. The objective of this meeting was first to better understand the problem and to validate the criteria found in the literature for the supplier selection problem with experts. Later, the same three decision-makers participated in each stage.\n\nThus, in the AHP stage, the three DMs in the company concerned was asked to answer a questionnaire including all possible pairwise comparisons for criteria. The questionnaire was presented in an Excel worksheet and sent by email for managers DM1, DM2, DM3. They jointly completed the questionnaire of the possible pairwise comparisons as they wanted to prioritize the criteria in the same way, so that they agreed on the preferences of the criteria. Thus, no aggregation was required for data at this stage. Then, we obtained matrix results and priority weights for evaluation criteria.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n# Defining sustainability selection criteria\n\n# Initial evaluation of criteria and Causal diagram\n\n# Step 1.

Graphical representation of multi-stage hybrid decision support methodology using AHP-DEMATEL-BN.\n\nNext, in the DEMATEL stage, we sent by email also a questionnaire as an Excel worksheet for the three managers. Each decision-maker was asked to evaluate the direct influence of criterion “ci” on criterion “cj” using a linguistic scale. In order to aggregate the data from the three managers, the DEMATEL method was proposed to calculate the average matrix. Then, the sums of total effects and the net affect among all criteria are calculated.\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 10584 7 of 23\n\nThen, in the BN stage, we conducted first a meeting by video conference with the three managers in order to introduce the causal graph and the ordinal states (very low, low, medium, high and very high) that could be allocated for each criterion. These ranges were determined using feedback from three case company managers which were specific to their organization.\n\nThen, decision-makers participated together a meeting and sent us by email data for case suppliers S1, S2 and S3, as a summary of their judgments regarding potential suppliers according to each criterion that was used as principal input in the BN model.\n\nDuring the whole period, we also made intermediate online calls in order to present and discuss the results of each work package stage with the three decision-makers.\n\nThen, the different steps of the proposed approach are explained through this case study.\n\n# 3.1. Defining Sustainability Selection Criteria\n\nThis step is significant because a correctly identified set of criteria plays a vital role in supporting the decision-making process [6]. We define the criteria under economic (Eco), environmental (Env) and social dimensions (Soc) based on the literature review and the opinion of the decision-makers of the company. Thus, key decision criteria are investigated from a comprehensive literature review [5,9,15,25]. Then, these criteria are validated with decision-makers as an initial step in the sustainable supplier selection process. Criteria are defined as follows:\n\n- Overall costs (Eco1): This is a key criterion for evaluating a supplier because it dictates the total supply chain cost. This criterion includes transportation and purchasing costs.\n- Quality of product (Eco2): This is the capability of products and material to meet the quality standards for production processes. Scrap rate is used to determine the quality of delivered parts in this study.\n- Quality of service (Eco3): This criterion represents the ability of a partner to satisfy demand and perform various functions in terms of delivery.\n- Reducing pollution (Env1): The total emitted CO2 by each supplier is used to determine their performance regarding reducing pollution.\n- Resource consumption (Env2): Suppliers are evaluated regarding the amount of energy consumption. Building energy performance indicator in kwh/m2/year is used.\n- Environmental management system (Env3): The level of effort to reduce environmental impact is measured by an environmental management system certification (ISO 14001) (https://nbs.net/p/3-ways-smes-can-tackle-iso-14001-70c12e6b-8c15-428b-9c15-c248f08cf098).
