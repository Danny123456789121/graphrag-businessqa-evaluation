Research has indicated that PO is an important predictor of the status of members of organizations [56, 58, 66, 69, 70]. Studies have indicated that factors such as the work performance and satisfaction of work can be predicted by organization-based PO [58, 59, 71, 72].\n\nThe PO of green products can predict individuals’ organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35]. When PO is assigned to a certain subject matter, employees tend to regard it as a social entity, be psychologically related to it, be willing to take risks for it, and generate positive attitudes and behaviors toward it. In general, according to PO theory, GPPO refers to the PO generated by employees of a company for its green products when they regard the products as a subject matter. GPPO enables a company’s employees to exhibit positive attitudes and behaviors, and this contributes to organizational performance and encourages employees to actively search for information regarding company products, services, and related environmental policies that they did not understand initially. To maintain GPPO, employees become more willing to follow relevant environmental regulations and practices. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\n\n# Hypothesis 4 (H4).\n\nGPPO is negatively associated with EGC.\n\n# Hypothesis 5 (H5).\n\nGPPO is positively associated with EEP.\n\n# 2.3.3. Mediating Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)\n\nPO differs according to the motivation for possession. The feeling of possession is ubiquitous. Possession can be a tangible goal, an intangible goal, or a statutory but not legal form of ownership [73].\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\n# 6 of 19\n\nWhen the inner and psychological feelings possessed by an individual are integrated, and the members of the organization will be based on human instinct motivation, they may feel such ownership due to various factors in the organization and practice to further satisfy. In particular, when the target slowly becomes a part of the owner’s psychological identification, PO is generated [58].\n\nAccording to PO theory, an individual’s PO of a certain subject matter originates from four demand motivations that include (1) efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation [58 –61]. The psychological history of PO as well as the personal positive behaviors and attitudes are based on interpretations of the subject of PO. According to the theoretical perspective of expectation motivation, an individual’s positive performance and contribution are related to the desire to meet expectations [48, 49]. Consequently, when the underlying motivation of an individual’s PO meets the expected value, the individual would exhibit a highly positive behavior and attitude. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:\n\n# Hypothesis 6a (H6a).\n\nThe relationship between the exposure to EGC and GSV is mediated by GPPO.\n\n# Hypothesis 6b (H6b).\n\nThe relationship between the exposure to EEP and GSV is mediated by GPPO.\n\n# 2.4. Negative Effects of Employee Green Confusion (EGC) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)\n\nCompanies are facing considerable pressure from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, business partners, and environmental organizations, to focus their policies on the environment [74] and develop, produce, and sell environmentally friendly products. Companies intending to achieve the goal of sustainable development may do well to formulate a GSV to promote all aspects of relevant environmental protection measures to create a green image of themselves [75 – 79]. Employees may experience information overload when an enterprise manager releases excessive information regarding the enterprise’s environmental regulations, products, or services to quickly respond to requests from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, environmental organizations, and governments.\n\nMitchell, Walsh, and Yamin [32] indicated that people exhibit different levels of information cognition and digestion when they process information. When the amount of information increases, the likelihood of information overload also increases. The release of a large amount of information can cause confusion among employees [32, 33] as well as make it difficult for employees to focus on the relevant environmental regulations promoted by the company and to interactively exchange environmental knowledge with relevant stakeholders. The aforementioned phenomenon of employee confusion is called EGC. When EGC occurs, employees’ interactions with their organization’s relevant norms and stakeholders are affected. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 7 (H7).\n\nEGC is negatively associated with EEP.\n\nThe research framework is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\n# Employee Green Confusion (EGC)\n\n# Green Shared Vision (GSV)\n\n# Psychological Ownership (GPPO)\n\n# Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)\n\n# Figure 2. Research framework.\n\n# 3. Methodology and Measurement\n\n# 3.1. Data Collection and Sample\n\nTo verify the aforementioned hypotheses in the Taiwan production industry, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The study participants were staff members who worked in the information services, electronics, components manufacturing, computer and peripheral products, health care and biotech, communication equipment manufacturing, electronic products and components, equipment and machinery manufacturing, and software industries in Taiwan. The questionnaire survey sample was randomly selected from the “Business Directory of Taiwan.” The participants were leaders or managers of the manufacturing, research and development, environment, or marketing departments or members of environmental product development projects. To ensure a high degree of content validity in this research, two rounds of pretests were conducted.\n\nRespondents from different industries and sectors were recruited in this study because such recruitment reduces common method variance problems. To effectively improve the response rate, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire, before the questionnaire was issued, we contacted the relevant companies by phone to determine whether they provided green products or related services and confirmed whether green products were their primary\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
