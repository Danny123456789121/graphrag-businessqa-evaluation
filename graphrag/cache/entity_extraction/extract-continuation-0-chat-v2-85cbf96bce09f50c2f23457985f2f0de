Including industry portfolios is particularly attractive for our research since the climate-economy literature has predictions for how different industries should be affected. We thus use 55 size-value and industry portfolios (25 size-value portfolios plus 30 industry portfolios) as our test assets, instead of just 25 size-value portfolios.\n\nSince temperature variation is a systematic risk, we expect to see that the temperature shock factor is priced and that its premium is negative. The results based on the primary specification for constructing the temperature shock factor are reported in Table 2. The first-pass results for each of the four models: CAPM, the Fama-French model (FF), the CAPM plus the temperature shock factor (CAPM+TSF), and the Fama-French model plus the temperature shock factor (FF+TSF) are similar. In each case, the GRS test rejects the model. The second-pass results reveal that the risk premium for the temperature shock factor is significantly negative as predicted. The model has a higher average cross-sectional R-square when the temperature shock factor is included in the Fama-MacBeth regressions.
