However, it has also been linked to the deskilling of professional work (Xue et al., 2022), and potentially, may induce unethical management decision making.\n\nHowever, AI systems and types have also swiftly evolved creating new opportunities and challenges for both academic and business practitioners. Such is the case of Generative AI, which has become popular since a conventional bot called ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) was first released for public use in November 2022, followed by a superior version in March 2023 (ChatGPT-4) (OpenAI Blog, 2022). ChatGPT has gained significant popularity since the launch for its ability to generate compelling human-like answers to almost any question asked. The ChatGPT-human interaction is realistic and conversational in the sense that the bot can answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, and eject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT represents a significant departure from conventional AI algorithms based on ML which can identify patterns in large datasets and make predictions. We can observe this predictive ability in search engines like Google, which offer autocomplete recommendations to enhance quality of search results. However, ChatGPT goes beyond mere prediction. It utilizes generative AI language models, enabling it to generate entirely new content based solely on the question prompts provided by a user. This textual content can take various forms, such as news articles, poetry, movie scripts, business plans, software codes, research manuscripts, and marketing campaigns. The quality of its output relies on the quality of the input it receives, considering both the training data it has been exposed to and the prompts provided by users to describe the task they want it to accomplish.\n\nThe language model (“brain” behind the ChatGPT) uses generative AI. Generative AI refers to integration of ML models to generate new content, including text, audio, video, images, software code and simulations, based on large datasets used to train the model. However, the contextual relevance of new content generated will depend on the quality, timeliness, and relevance of the training dataset (Boston Consulting Group Generative AI, 2023; McKinsey & Featured Insights, 2023). For example, GPT4 is trained using around 45 terabytes of data gathered from all over the web only until 2021 (Open AI GPT 4 Technical Report, 2023). Therefore, the responses are unlikely to provide recent and up-to-date information.\n\nLet us uncover the history behind ChatGPT to better understand its evolution (Figure 1). Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained using vast amount of textual data and they infer relationships between words within the text to predict the next word in a sequence of words to form a sentence. However, initial LLMs processed each word individually and sequentially in a block of text, limiting the context, meaningfulness, and efficiency of the outputs. This led to the development of transformers in 2017, which can process all words in a dataset simultaneously, giving varying weights to different parts of the text, making the outputs more meaningful and accurate (Uszkoreit, 2017). The feature enabled processing significantly large datasets efficiently and led to the development of GPT models.\n\nOpenAI launched GPT-1 in 2018, followed by GPT-2 in 2019, GPT-3 in 2020, Instruct-GPT and ChatGPT in 2022, followed by GPT-4 in March 2023 (see Figure 1). Since its inception, GPT models have been trained using huge datasets (around 575 GB training dataset in case of GPT-3) and significant number of parameters (175 billion in case of GPT-3) to be able to answer question prompts (OpenAI Research Blog LM, 2023). However, GPT-3 would produce incorrect outputs having false information (referred to as hallucinations), which may include harmful and offensive content as there were no safety parameters and may also produce irrelevant results. This led to integrating supervised and reinforcement ML techniques to incorporate human feedback in the training process which will produce outputs aligned to the users' intent and context of the prompt (Ouyang et al., 2023).\n\n# BUDHWAR et al.\n\n# Superior\n\n|1|Similar models launched since GPT-4|\n|---|---|\n| |Meta ImageBind multisensory AI model, May 2023|\n| |Google Project Magi, May 2023|\n|7|Google Bard, March 2023|\n| |DALL-E2, superior version of DALL-E launched in 2022|\n| |Meta LLaMa, February 2023|\n| |Generating digital images from natural language descriptions:|\n| |GPT-4 factual, generate longer text outputs than around 100 trillion parameters (rumored).|\n| |DALL-E, 2021, using GPT-3|\n|5|AnstructGPT, ChatGPT, and extract information from images|\n|7|GPT-3 generate sensible and useful text fit to the context and conversational feature, using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technique|\n|2020|GPT-2 175 billion parameters, generating human-like text, answering questions, writing code, sentences were correct but not fit to the context|\n|3|1.5 billion parameters trained on more than 10 times the data used for GPT-1|\n|L|GPT-1 2018 117 million parameters trained on Common Crawl; web pages with billions of words and Book Corpus, collection of over 11,000 books on a variety of genres:|\n| |Transformer Architecture launched by Google\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
