The three strategy dimensions may be defined as follows:\n\n- The strategy process itself comprises the construction and development phase of a strategy.\n- The conditions surrounding strategic activities are the strategy context. The context influences the possibilities and limitations of the strategy. For example, regulations, natural resource scarcities, or pressures/innovations arising from NGOs can impose limits on, or provide opportunities for, organizations and communities.\n- The strategy content represents the output of the strategy process, what is termed the result of strategic activities. This covers what is offered, what is\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\ncreated, the goals that the organization/community in question should pursue, what the organization/community in question needs to do to achieve their goals and the implications of the endeavor for the organization, community and its different shareholders and stakeholders (including the implications for the global social system and the natural ecosystem).\n\nA closer examination of corporate sustainability strategies and sustainable strategic management is also presented in this paper. Corporate sustainability strategies describe how sustainability issues are dealt with in practice. In profit-oriented organizations, these usually form a subset of the corporate competitive strategy. One essential item here is the advantage that is identified by the management board while pursuing sustainability, that is, the strategic reason stated for developing and implementing a specific corporate sustainability strategy. This strategic decision can be grounded in normative-ethical considerations or in (pure) economic rationality, or both. If it is the former, sustainable development is seen as a superior goal that is motivated by ethical issues. If it is the latter, the economic advantages that may be gained from improving sustainable behavior are stressed. The term ‘economic’ is used here in a relatively broad sense and encompasses such things as cost reductions, increased competitiveness, improved company image and reputation, all of which help ensure that corporate activities meet the legal requirements (Baumgartner, 2014). Viewed in an even broader context, this may also include the proactive influence that a company seeks with regard to their influence on public policy and regulations on sustainability.\n\nThe main reason for choosing a sustainability approach is to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of corporate activities while improving (or at least not reducing) the economic performance of the corporation. In addition, corporate sustainability can improve the sustainability performance of other actors and systems. In principle, the individual company, business community, society and nature can all benefit from more sustainable corporate behavior. Both external developments and internal strengths and weaknesses need to be considered when attempting to integrate sustainable development issues into strategic planning (Eccles et al., 2012; Engert et al., 2016). Consequently, a corporate sustainability strategy integrates social and environmental dimensions into the strategic management process and highlights the strategic position of a company with regard to sustainable development.\n\nThe integration of environmental and social issues into corporate mid-term and long-term goals demands that a careful balance be achieved between the needs of internal and external stakeholders. This is essential to maintain or improve corporate sustainability performance. As the needs of stakeholders and the environment tend to vary, both over time and according to the geographic setting, the strategic planning process must be sufficiently flexible. Basically, corporate sustainability strategies can be distinguished on the basis of whether they have\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nAn internal focus (introverted or conservative) or an external focus (extroverted and visionary) (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Operational and normative issues also impact the integration of sustainability (Baumgartner, 2014). The normative management level comprises those values that are shared by the management board and embedded in the organizational culture. For example, the degree to which the prevailing culture welcomes or resists the notion of sustainable development is likely to have a huge impact (Baumgartner, 2009; Linnenluecke and Griffith, 2009). At the operational level, clear, short-term, departmental goals must be derived on the basis of the corporate sustainability strategy. This means that it has to be clearly communicated throughout the organization (Baumgartner, 2014). Further cultural elements that support the adoption of a sustainable strategy are an ability and willingness to accept change, a commitment to innovation and the existence of high levels of trust within the organization (Eccles et al., 2012).\n\n# 3 Societal and business outcome of sustainable strategic management\n\nIn this section, the societal and business values of strategic sustainability management are discussed. Here, two aspects are relevant: first, the definition of sustainability-related outcomes, and second, the question of which entity is expected to benefit from this sustainability-related outcome (on this point, also see the definition of the term “strategic perspective” in section 2). Regarding the latter point, it is necessary to distinguish between the societal and business values of corporate sustainability. Creating societal value1 through corporate sustainability management requires the achievement of compatibility between the content of the strategy and the needs of society and the biosphere. This is discussed in section 3.1. Integrating the context dimension into strategy formulation enables corporate sustainability management to create business value. This is discussed in section 3.2.\n\n# 3.1 Societal value of sustainable strategic management – the content dimension\n\nIn its most basic form, sustainable development meets the needs of the present generations such that the needs of future generations are not compromised (WCED, 1987). Once it has been agreed upon that all members of society are responsible for creating such a sustainable form of development, companies are also expected to act responsibly. All corporate activities have an influence on society and the natural environment and, therefore, may (or may not) contribute to sustainable development.\n\nHow can companies create societal value while contributing to sustainable development? To answer this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the\n\n1 Societal value refers to both society and nature.\n\n# ACCEPT\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
