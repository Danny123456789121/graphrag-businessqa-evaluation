In other words, publication selection bias exists when researchers prefer statistically significant results or results that are consistent with the theory and previous research outcomes (Stanley, 2005). One potential source of publication bias might be the selective reporting of results depending on the number of lagged years (Bruns & Stern, 2018). Finally, we explore the heterogeneity of results by applying a meta‐regression analysis incorporating differences in measurement, study quality, regions, time, industry, data, and estimation procedures among the primary studies. This procedure should reveal the main drivers of the variation among the primary study results.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sums up the theoretical literature for the different causalities between CEP and CFP.\n\n# 2 | THEORY OF THE CEP–CFP RELATION\n\nFor the interaction between the two dimensions, three causal directions are plausible: CEP influences CFP, CFP affects CEP, and a bidirectional relationship. Besides the direction of the effect, literature\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\nis also inconsistent about the sign of the relation, which might be negative, neutral, or positive. In this section, we briefly present the theoretical considerations, each pointing to a certain causality between CEP and CFP, as they also underlie the primary studies included in our meta‐analytical data set. For the categorization of the existing theoretical constructs, we follow the structure by Preston and O'Bannon (1997) and Waddock and Graves (1997), which is summarized in Figure 1 and briefly outlined below.\n\n# 2.1 CEP affects CFP\n\nConcerning the first causal sequence, the most antiquated argument for the potential impact of CEP on CFP is known as the trade‐off hypothesis, indicating a negative influence as formulated by Levitt (1958). Thus, environmental engagement requires financial investments by the firm, which are not completely compensated by financial returns from environmental activities. These negative effects might especially occur in the short term, when the costs are realized. Because firms not investing in CEP do not have to bear these costs, following Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield (1985) and Vance (1975), these unfair costs might be a danger to free market economy. As the generation of financial returns constitutes the primary goal of a firm, CEP stands in a competing relationship with CFP. Research by Bragdon Jr. and Marlin (1972) complements that there is only a choice between investing in a profitable firm or a responsible firm. Conversely, the creation of additional value is the single social corporate responsibility (Friedman, 2002).\n\nThe supply and demand model, a theoretical framework modeling CFP independently from CEP and vice versa, is developed by McWilliams and Siegel (2001). It proposes the existence of an optimal investment in environmental engagement, which can be determined by cost–benefit analysis. Accordingly, the decision for environmental investments should be based on the same principles as any other investment (Barnett, 2007; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). This leads to a synthesis of interests, as not only the maximization of profitability demanded by shareholders is considered but also the claims of stakeholders for environmental responsibility, such as those of customers, employees, and communities (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). However, firms following this procedure do not exhibit higher profitability than those who do not invest in environmental activities. Assuming that all firms take optimal decisions and they are within the optimum between supply and demand, they are equally profitable. As soon as one firm has a higher return on investment, the competing company would change its product strategy (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001).\n\nA positive impact of CEP on CFP is motivated by the Porter hypothesis. Consequently, environmental regulation might induce innovations in order to increase a firm's efficiency and competitiveness (Esty & Porter, 1998). Because pollution as an outcome of CEP can be seen as economic waste, pollution reduction contributes to a firm's profitability (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). We conclude that although innovations take time for development, firms profit from them in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, the assumption of a positive influence of CEP on CFP by the natural‐resource‐based view (NRBV) is based on the resource‐based view proposed by Barney (1991), Hart (1995), and Wernerfelt (1984). Hence, the strategic advantages of a firm can be reduced to the access to strategically valuable resources in a firm's individual and hard to duplicate resource bundle, for example, the particular mix of management skills, business processes, routines, or knowledge and a superior utilization of the available resources (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011). However, in consideration of technological developments and changes in the environment, the concentration on core competences loses its effect, which justifies the relevance of the NRBV (Kraaijenbrink, Spender, & Groen, 2010; Tushman & Anderson, 1986). Accordingly, the competitive advantage of a firm is directly linked to how it deals with the natural environment, as responsible behavior enables a firm to gather further capabilities and new resources, such as knowledge or enhanced corporate culture (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006). Hart (1995) complements that strategy and competitive advantages are strongly influenced by the environmental performance of a firm, whereas pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development are the core drivers. Following Davis (1973), environmental responsibility consequently leads to a long‐term profit maximization followed by a better community and society.\n\nThe NRBV is supported by the instrumental stakeholder theory (Davis,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
