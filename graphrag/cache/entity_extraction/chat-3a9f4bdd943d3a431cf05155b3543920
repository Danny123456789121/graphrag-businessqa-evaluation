This new concept of career has gained the name of a balanced career. Its source lies in the more commonly used concept of human sustainability.\n\nAn exemplary definition was provided by Carl Holling, who defined human sustainability as: “the capacity to create, test and maintain adaptive capability” [49] (p. 390). Holling’s definition is related to the operationalization of the concept of employability by Van der Heijde and Van der Heijden and reads: “The capacity of continuously fulfilling, acquiring or creating of work through the optimal use of competences” [50] (p. 453). The latter suggests an important responsibility of the individual employee in creating, testing, and maintaining his or her own work capacity or ability. On a similar note, Oldham and Hackman [51] stressed the increasing importance of personal initiative of workers to successfully progress or adjust one’s work capacity or ability across time by shaping or customizing their jobs in order to protect their sustainability at work (for example, via job crafting) [52].\n\nIn the view of the above, the concept of sustainable careers could be perceived as ‘sequences of job opportunities that go beyond the boundaries of single employment settings’ [53].\n\nThe sociological approach aims to make HRM activities more of a social practice. The interests and commitment of the three elements—the employee, the employer, and the society—are closely related in this perspective. Issues such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or social issues such as employee diversity, age, gender, nationality or ethnicity, disability, etc. are of great importance in this approach.\n\nSocially responsible human resource management manifests itself in the treatment of employees as important stakeholders of the enterprise [54]. Diversity management will be used to study the social aspect of Sustainable HRM.\n\nDiversity is often defined as any significant difference that distinguishes one individual from another—a description that encompasses a broad range of overt and hidden qualities. Researchers classify diversity characteristics into four areas:\n\n- Personality (traits, skills and abilities),\n- internal (gender, race, ethnicity, IQ, sexual orientation),\n- external (culture, nationality, religion, marital or parental status), and\n- organizational (position, department, union/non-union) [54].\n\nOrganizational policies formulated to manage diversity aim to implement initiatives, activities, and practices that recognize, promote, or encourage the differences between groups or people. These elements are seen as positive values that warrant development to achieve social integration, which can also boost productivity of the company and support the democratization of access to opportunities [55].\n\nDiversity means the dissimilarity, variety, and individuality that emerges from various differences between people. Diversity of individual abilities, experiences, competencies, and qualifications of human resources contributes to the success factor in organizations, which enables entrepreneurial strategies of increasing flexibility and continuous learning. Managing Diversity is more than a scheme. It is an attitude and a new understanding of how enterprises function and how to manage human resources in a sustainable way. Creating and applying effective diversity management concepts is one of the main challenges in modern organizations [56].\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\nHuman resource management involves planning, integration, and actions to achieve effective management of all employees. Diversity can be included in the set of human management practices, guaranteeing an alignment between the strategies of human resources and diversity management goals.\n\nThe ecological perspective concerns those aspects of HRM that can help make an organization “greener” (environmentally-friendly). This includes activities such as employee training in sustainable development or stimulation of pro-environmental behaviours that create employee competences. The wide spectrum of the definition of “green” HRM is shown in Table 1.\n\n|Definition|Author|\n|---|---|\n|A new research direction oriented towards environmental management through HRM practices in the enterprise (..)|Gholami [57] (p.147)|\n|Environmentally friendly HR practices for the sustainable use of resources|Bangwal, Tiwari [58] (p.46)|\n|Focusing on [the potential of] affecting employees’ green behaviours|Dumont [59] (p. 15)|\n|Green HRM is HRM practices developed and implemented to promote employee behaviour that increases the ecological efficiency of the entire company.|Ackermann [60] (p. 22)|\n\nSource: Own study based on [50].\n\nEmployees, employers, customers, and regulatory stakeholders can be stimulants of green HRM. The literature also indicates three strategies used by employers to stimulate green behaviour [61]. They are as follows:\n\n1. Mobilizing employees to implement sustainability in basic operations and at every stage and level of their business;\n2. Holding employees accountable for applying sustainable practices in their work and encouraging them to further such practices in pay incentives;\n3. Equipping employees with tools and training them to develop for further improvements.\n\nThe authors focusing on the issue of “green” HRM point to a number of ecological practices that can be applied in the area of human resource management at all individual stages of the human resource process [62] as:\n\n- Including tasks related to environmental protection in job descriptions,\n- Taking into account green competences as a component of the requirements profile at each workplace,\n- Preference in the recruitment and selection process of candidates with competences and experience in implementing ecological projects,\n- Encouraging the development of “green” competences and offering environmental training for employees and managers,\n- Inclusion of ecological criteria in the periodic assessment of employees,\n- Sharing knowledge in relation to environmental initiatives and programs and rewarding for their implementation, and\n- Encouraging ecological behaviour during the performance of professional tasks (i.e., limiting the use of paper\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
