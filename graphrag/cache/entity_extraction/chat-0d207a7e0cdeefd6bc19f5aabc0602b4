Second and more importantly, the perspectives differ. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) do not disentangle the cash-flow and discount-rate effects. Given that cash-flow effects of temperature variation are well documented in the new climate-economy literature, we focus here on identifying the discount-rate effect of temperature shocks.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 states three testable hypotheses and briefly discusses the data. Section 3 presents the tracking portfolio approach of\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nconstructing the temperature shock factor. Section 4 provides estimates of the loadings and the premium on the temperature shock factor. Section 5 investigates specifically the quantitative impact of temperature shocks on the cost of equity capital. Section 6 discusses further empirical results, and Section 7 concludes with a discussion of implications and a brief summary.\n\n# 2. Hypotheses and data\n\nTemperature shocks essentially act as a systematic negative productivity shock in the context of Balvers and Huang (2007). Since temperature shocks negatively affect most firms (i.e. the factor loadings on the temperature shock factor are generally negative), the risk premium must be negative to ensure that riskier assets have higher average returns.\n\n# HYPOTHESIS 1.\n\nThe temperature shock factor has a significant and negative risk premium.\n\nTemperature shocks may have an uneven impact. In particular, some sectors are more vulnerable: Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; transportation; and manufacturing, because these sectors have high exposure to climate (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014). Furthermore, Quiggin and Horowitz (2003) emphasize adjustment costs to temperature changes. They argue that costs of adjustment arise if capital stocks: (i) are dependent on climate for their optimal location; and (ii) depreciate more slowly than is required to permit easy adjustment to a changing climate. Thus, firms with capital in place, value firms, should be more vulnerable. Along this line, small firms should be more sensitive to temperature shocks, because they may lack resources to adjust. If temperature shocks are truly a risk factor, the industries or firms that are more sensitive to temperature shocks should have higher loadings (in absolute value) on the temperature factor and, accordingly, higher required returns and costs of capital.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# HYPOTHESIS 2\n\nIndustries or firms that are more vulnerable to temperature shocks have higher loadings (in absolute value) on the temperature shock factor. If suspicions of climate change have intensified in recent decades, the aggregate importance of temperature shocks ought to have risen. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) substantiate that negative elasticity of asset prices to temperature fluctuations has been increasing over time, which motivates us to test the following hypothesis.\n\n# HYPOTHESIS 3\n\nThe impact of the temperature shock factor on the average cost of equity capital increases over time. Dictated by data availability, our sample period starts in April 1953 and ends in May 2015. In terms of location, we limit ourselves to the United States, because the required temperature and financial-market data are available for the U.S. and are uniformly accurate. The portfolio returns and Fama-French factor data are from Kenneth French’s website. The macro variables data are from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The temperature is the U.S. average temperature series obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. In addition, we merge CRSP and Compustat to construct a variety of equity portfolios for empirical testing.\n\n# Economic Tracking Portfolios: A Non-Structural Approach\n\nTo infer the news concerning future temperature variation contained in current stock returns, we employ the economic tracking portfolio approach proposed by Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989) and Lamont (2001) and previously applied by Vassalou (2003) and Kapadia (2011). This statistical approach allows us to estimate the risk premium of temperature shocks without imposing a particular model of asset pricing.\n\n# 3.1. Primary specification\n\nOur simple time-series model is essentially the daily temperature model of Campbell and Diebold (2005) amended to deal with monthly observations and to avoid seasonal adjustment:\n\nTt+12 = c + at + εt+12,\n\nwhere Tt+12 is the average temperature from month t+1 to t+12, t is the deterministic time trend, and εt+12 captures effects of all other variables (emissions, climate policy, etc.). Tautologically, we can separate Tt+12 into a previously expected component, a news component, and noise:\n\nTt+12 = E-1(Tt+12) + ∆Et(Tt+12) + εt\n\nwhere the news component is ∆Et(Tt+12) = E(Tt+12) - E-t(Tt+12), which is contained in the temperature observation in month t, and the noise component is εt+12 = Tt+12 - Et(Tt+12).\n\nIf temperature variation matters for asset pricing, innovations in excess returns of basis assets should reflect innovations in expectations about future temperature variation. That is,\n\n∆Et(Tt+12) = b[Rt - E-1(Rt)] + εt,\n\nwhere Rt - E-1(Rt) represents a column vector of unexpected excess returns, with Rt a column vector of excess returns of the basis assets in month t (i.e., returns net of the risk-free rate), and εt the component of news that is orthogonal to the unexpected excess returns of the basis assets.\n\nAssume that the basis asset excess returns in month t are a linear function of Z1, a vector of conditioning economic variables known at t-1, and that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
