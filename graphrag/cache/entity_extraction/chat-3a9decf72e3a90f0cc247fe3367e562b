Dystopian scenarios\n\nDespite the current and foreseeable advancements, it is extremely unlikely that AI technology will pose an existential threat to humankind. The idea of a superhuman AI technology taking over and turning against humans is extensively exploited by science fiction literature and both intellectually exciting and frightening. There are several reasons to not worry about such scenario with the current knowledge. Firstly, such an initiative would need to be triggered either by a human instructing it to do so (in which case AI is just a tool used by a human) or if the AI algorithm could take such initiative on its own, it would require that it is conscious in the psychological sense and that it could self-reflect and act upon internal motivation and not a human-defined goal. This is not the way even the most advanced published algorithms are operating right now. Secondly, even if a powerful AI algorithm is turned against humans (either because of instructions given by human or self-gained consciousness), it is currently lacking the physical interface to inflict substantial harm in the real world. In simple words if the AI algorithm misbehaves it is possible to just pull the plug. AI techniques can be a powerful tool in the hands of people who intend to inflict harm. Therefore technology such as autonomous lethal weapon systems which rely on AI need to follow strict processes as to when a human operator needs to be involved.\n\n# 5. Legal aspects and intellectual property rights (IPR)\n\nThis article could have been generated by a GAI program. It would have been fluent, methodically correct and factual. In such a case whose would be the intellectual property rights? Would it be the authors of this article, the company who trained the model or the model itself? It needs to be also considered that the data on which a given model was trained may be also subject to copyright or otherwise licensed. In April 2023 the CEO and owner of Twitter platform threatened a lawsuit against Microsoft by claiming it\n\n# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023\n\nhad illegally used Twitter’s data to train its Machine Learning model (BBC, 2023). Similarly there are already known legal cases regarding copyright violation against the creators of graphics that use a special kind of AI model, Stable Diffusion to generate graphics including art. There is a similar situation in the music industry where AI engines having learned a particular artist’s voice and style can generate fresh content copying the original artist’s expression. While some artists see this as a risk, others seem to be open to profit from the new opportunity. Grimes, one of artists declared: “I’ll split 50% royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice, feel free to use my voice without penalty” (Twitter, 2023). Such revenue sharing schemes may be a way for established artists to gain from the new technology and scale up.\n\nThis is one of the challenges that the new technology poses from the legal standpoint (European Parliament, 2020b). It is a similar consideration to a situation where an autonomous vehicle causes an accident—who is responsible? It could be argued that even if the content was generated by an algorithm it was the proper input (a series of prompts) that made the content possible. It could also be argued that the GAI model is simply a form of editing aid and that the original thought comes from the authors. Even basic text editors use text prediction and autocorrect features to correct spelling mistakes, grammar and even style of a text document. Moving forward it will be difficult to draw the line on where “correction” ends and true authoring of a text starts. In March 2023 Microsoft announced that it will be adding generative AI support—a feature called Copilot—directly into its Office package including Word, Excel or PowerPoint (CNBC, 2023). The issue of intellectual property also expands to visual art generated by AI, the designs and source code of software that was automatically generated. ChatGPT is even capable of generating texts of songs or poems on a given topic. Another aspect is liability for damage potentially inflicted. If a chat with GAI model persuades someone to commit a crime or to self-harm legal responsibility becomes an issue.\n\nSimilarly as it was with crypto currencies it seems that technology is developing faster than the relevant legal framework and many legal cases are still in unchartered territory. Initiatives undertaken to regulate the new sphere in a way that would be resilient to rapid development in the technology can be identified. One example of this lawmaking effort is the proposal for “Laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain union legislative acts” by the European Commission created in 2021 (European Commission, 2021). Currently it seems reasonable to act with caution regarding both the copyright of the data used to train the model and the outputs generated by a given model. There seems to be a clear need for a new legal paradigm considering AI technologies where in many cases existing legislation struggles.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nOne of the current limitations of GAI is the fact that the training process is a significant undertaking both in respect of cost and time. For that reason the existing models operate on a “snapshot” of the data. The model trained yesterday will not be able to discuss and consider today’s news. This is a well-understood limitation and there are ongoing works on merging the functionality of the LLMs and well-known search engines to overcome that limitation (Google, 2023; Mehdi, 2023).\n\nThe ultimate direction in the development of AI technology would be something referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This milestone would mark the beginning of a truly intelligent algorithm. What makes this particularly tricky is when such a milestone is achieved is the lack of common agreement when it comes to the definition of intelligence. It is usually defined by a set of terms\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
