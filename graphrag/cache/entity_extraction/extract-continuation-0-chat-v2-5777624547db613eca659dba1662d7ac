The benefits linked to “improving firm performance” and “support for sustainable innovation” and “support the green supply chain”, for example, are linked to all the seven OCSs identified in this survey. Just as a single OCS can be tied to different benefits, such as OCS related to collaborative relationships for sustainability can bring companies nine of the ten sustainability benefits identified in the survey.
