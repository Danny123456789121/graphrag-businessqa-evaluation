(2019). This latter paper, for example, shows that there is much more disagreement among raters on environmental ratings compared to credit ratings, but still less compared to social and governance ratings. To partly account for the limited reliability of environmental ratings and scores, we use the E score in combination with quantitative data on carbon emissions. We also show Performing the analysis from January 2010 to August 2018 yields empirical results in line with the ones provided in Section 5. See Directive 2014/95/EU. On this point, Short and Toffel (2008) document that firms tend to disclose more when they are immune from prosecution for self-disclosed violations.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nthat using only one or the other component of the greenness and transparency indicator does not yield meaningful results (see Section 6).\n\nFinally, among non-transparent firms, we further select a subsample that we label ‘brown’. These are companies which are mainly active in sectors characterized by a comparatively higher level of carbon emissions. Information on sectoral emissions in Europe is provided by Eurostat, at the NACE-2 digit level.10 Table 9 in the Appendix lists the economic sectors responsible for the largest amount of carbon emissions in the EU. Overall, these sectors account for 85% of the total GHG emissions in the EU over the 2008-2017 period. Table 10 in the Appendix lists the companies that are included in the brown portfolio in 2017.\n\n# 4 Linear factor model\n\nWe assume an approximate factor structure for excess returns combined with the absence of arbitrage opportunities to obtain asset pricing restrictions. As the greenness and transparency indicator defined in Equation (1) is only available for a relatively short sample, we opt for a time-invariant model, which assumes that the exposition of an asset i to each observable factor does not evolve over time. We acknowledge that a model that accounts for time variation in parameters and hence in risk premia would be best suited in this context, owing to the fact that awareness on climate issues has increased over time. However, a time-varying model for the excess returns could only be estimated on a much longer time series and a much larger cross-section than ours. Indeed, it would imply introducing functional specifications for the coefficients, which would result in an incidental parameter problem.\n\nLet us define the excess return on asset i = 1, ..., n at time t = 1, 2, ...T as Ri,t = ri,t − rf,t, where ri,t is the log-return and rf,t is the risk-free return. We assume that the excess return Ri,t satisfies the following linear factor model:\n\nRi,t = ai + ∑k=1Kbi,kft,k + εi,t,K (2)\n\nwhere ft,k is the k-th observable factor, with k = 1, ..., K. The error term εi,t is such that E[εi,t|Ft−1] = 0, and Cov[εi,t, ft|Ft−1] = 0, where Ft−1 is the lagged information set. The approximate factor structure holds for the variance-covariance of the error terms, i.e., Σε,t,n = [Cov[εi,t, εj,t|Ft−1]]i,j=1,...,n with bounded largest eigenvalue (see, e.g., Chamberlain and Rothschild, 1983). The following parameter restriction holds:11\n\nai = ∑k=1Kbi,kνk (3)\n\nwhere νk is a parameter defined for each k-th factor. The asset pricing restriction in Equation (3) can be rewritten as the usual linear relation between expected excess returns and risk premia:\n\nSource: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database.\n\nWe refer to Gagliardini et al. (2016) for theoretical results and proofs.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nE[Ri,t] = ∑bi,kλk.K (4)\n\nBased on Equations (3) and (4), the time-invariant risk premium associated to each k-th factor is the following:\n\nλk = E[ft,k] + νk. (5)\n\nThe risk premium λk is the sum of the expected return on the factor, which can be estimated as its first moment, plus the parameter νk, defined in the asset pricing restriction (3). Risk premia measure how much investors are willing to pay to hedge the systematic risk captured by the observable factors. When the factors are asset returns themselves (i.e., factors are tradable) and are assumed to be priced by the same model in (2), the risk premia are equal to the factor means (see, e.g., Jagannathan and Wang, 2002). However, if factors are non tradable, the parameter νk is non zero. Following Gagliardini et al. (2016), we do not assume a priori that the factors ft,k are tradable. Hence, we allow for the existence of market imperfections, such as transactions costs due to rebalancing and short selling, which are captured by ν (see e.g., Cremers et al., 2012).\n\nOur baseline factor models are summarized in the table below.\n\n|Model|Reference|Abbreviation|Factors|K|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Four-factor model|Carhart (1997)|CAR|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fmom,t|4|\n|Three-factor model|Fama and French (1993)|3FF|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t|3\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROSTAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union, providing data on various sectors including carbon emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAGLIARDINI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Gagliardini et al. are researchers who provided theoretical results and proofs related to asset pricing restrictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARHART<|>PERSON<|>Carhart is a researcher known for the four-factor model in asset pricing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMA AND FRENCH<|>PERSON<|>Fama and French are researchers known for the three-factor model in asset pricing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN PORTFOLIO<|>EVENT<|>The brown portfolio consists of companies characterized by a higher level of carbon emissions, selected for analysis in 2017.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E SCORE<|>EVENT<|>The E score is a metric used to assess environmental ratings in combination with quantitative data on carbon emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NACE-2<|>EVENT<|>NACE-2 is a classification system used to categorize economic sectors in Europe based on their emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECTION 5<|>EVENT<|>Section 5 refers to a part of the document that discusses empirical results related to environmental ratings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECTION 6<|>EVENT<|>Section 6 refers to a part of the document that discusses the greenness and transparency indicator.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROSTAT<|>BROWN PORTFOLIO<|>Eurostat provides information on sectoral emissions in Europe, which is relevant for the brown portfolio analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAGLIARDINI ET AL.<|>SECTION 5<|>Gagliardini et al. provided theoretical results that are discussed in Section 5 of the document<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARHART<|>FOUR-FACTOR MODEL<|>Carhart is associated with the development of the four-factor model in asset pricing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMA AND FRENCH<|>THREE-FACTOR MODEL<|>Fama and French are associated with the development of the three-factor model in asset pricing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E SCORE<|>SECTION 6<|>The E score is discussed in Section 6 as part of the analysis of environmental ratings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NACE-2<|>EUROSTAT<|>NACE-2 is used by Eurostat to provide data on sectoral emissions<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
