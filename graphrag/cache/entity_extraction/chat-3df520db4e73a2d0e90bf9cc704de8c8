Previously, the remit of experts, LLMs are now the focus of a wider public debate as to the future of work and the value of human labour more\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 9\n\nbroadly. Anxieties around revolutionary new technologies are not new – when steam trains began as a form of passenger transport, concerns were raised about the high speed potentially rendering passengers mad (Milne-Smith, 2016). Mobile phones similarly generated health concerns due to potential invisible radiation (FDA., 2022) or indeed the possibility of deformed fingers from mobile phone overuse – the “smartphone pinky” (Taylor, 2020). But overly boosterish evaluations of new technologies often turn out to be equally overblown. For example, 3D-printing technology was invented over 40 years ago but is only now seeing wider commercial adoption (PWC., 2016), and so-called MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) did not significantly challenge or reform the provision of higher education globally (Borden, 2014). For every example from history of a disruptive technology, it is equally possible to find a counterexample of hype without much subsequent effect. What is clear is that technology by itself does not disrupt business and society, but that only does so in conjunction with efficiency gains, setting of new standards and business model innovation (Cortada, 2006, 2013). And as the history of dot-com boom and bust has shown, understanding how to commercially exploit a technology can be more difficult than mastering it (Decker et al., 2022).\n\nWhile the debate about the role of AI in our professional, educational and personal lives rages on, we do not currently know how pervasive and commercially viable generative AI will become. Will it become a semi-public good, with most people being able to access AI tools either for free or in relatively affordable SaaS (software-as-a-service) packages, or, after its initial introduction, will the highest-performing AI models be so costly as to remain the preserve of large well-funded companies that deploy it with little oversight or transparency? At present, it looks as if AI will become ubiquitous. For instance, Microsoft's plans to introduce Copilot, an AI assistant in its Office Suite will see the technology becoming instantly available to hundreds of millions of users worldwide (Spataro, 2023). Integrating generative AI into widely adopted productivity suites will be a catalytic factor for meeting en masse the two key factors of technology acceptance, namely perceived useful and perceived ease of use (Davis, 1989). In turn this could normalise its use and influence how perceptions and future policies related to generative AI are set.\n\nBut an even more fundamental question is whether we will see AI replacing human labour and decisions, or playing a largely assistive role, facilitating human decision-making in the face of information overload. Both options stand to create substantial economic gains, and a recent Goldman Sachs report (Hatzius et al., 2023) predicted that generative AI could raise annual US labour productivity growth by just under 1½pp over a 10-year period following widespread adoption. Such expectations are dependent on the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
