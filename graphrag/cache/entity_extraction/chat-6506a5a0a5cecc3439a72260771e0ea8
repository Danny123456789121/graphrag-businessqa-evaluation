To approach the financial analysts as our study’s respondents, we sent an email to 200 financial managers who worked at these registered security companies. Their contact information was obtained online. Each manager was also asked to distribute our Web-based survey URL to their financial analysts. We received 129 usable responses. Table I shows the demographic information of the respondents of the survey.\n\n# 3.3 Data analysis\n\nIn this study, we build on and extend the work of Chow and Chen (2012). Chow and Chen (2012) have indicated the validity of the scale by GRI from the report preparers’ end. We did a validity test by applying the EFA to explore the perceived importance of corporate sustainability reporting from the report users’ perceptive. EFA is commonly used for interpreting self-reporting questionnaires which have been widely used in existing perception and motivation-based CSR research (Dincer and Dincer, 2012; Firmialy and Nainggolan, 2018; Hayton et al., 2004; Latif et al., 2018; Sheng and Chen, 2010). We performed EFA because it reduces a large number of reflective and latent measures into a smaller set (Hair et al., 1995); hence, it confirms the dimensions defined by the GRI and fosters our hypotheses testing in the later part of the study. EFA also provides the significance of validity for the construct under the GRI based on our questionnaires (Hayton et al., 2004).\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we adopted t-tests to confirm the level of importance based on our questionnaire results. t-tests are commonly used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores. A one-sample t-test is often considered when only a single sample of the participants and the questions are used to determine whether the\n\n# Table I Respondents’ profiles (N = 129)\n\n|Demographic variables|Frequency|(%)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Gender| | |\n|Male|61|47.3|\n|Female|68|52.7|\n|Location| | |\n|Beijing|55|42.6|\n|Shenzhen|31|24|\n|Jilin|43|33.3|\n|Education| | |\n|Below undergraduate level|4|3.1|\n|Undergraduate degree|67|51.9|\n|Postgraduate degree|55|42.6|\n|PhD|3|2.3|\n|Years of experience| | |\n|Less than 2 years|45|34.9|\n|3-4 years|14|10.9|\n|5-6 years|40|31|\n|7-8 years|16|12.4|\n|9 years and more|14|10.9|\n\nThe mean of the population from which the sample is drawn is the same as the hypothesised mean (Hair et al., 1995). In this study, one-sample t-test was adopted because the mean value drawn from the users’ perceived importance of each type of sustainability disclosure was compared with the level of importance intended by GRI (i.e. the value of 4 as per the Likert scale used).\n\n# 4. Results and analysis\n\n# 4.1 Exploratory factor analysis\n\nBased on the definition of the sustainability items from GRI, we prepared reflective indicators in the questionnaires in terms of environmental indicators, economic indicators, social indicators – labour and decent work, social indicators – human rights, social indicators – society and social indicators – product responsibility. The estimation of the EFA results is presented in Table II. Unsurprisingly, EFA reveals six underlying dimensions, which are consistent with the sustainability definition by GRI. We follow the similar approach of Latif et al. (2018) in the critical assumption of EFA. Firstly, our correlation matrix shows that all items were significant at p < 0.001 level. Interestingly, we detect that “environment grievance” in the environmental indicator construct has a relatively low factor loading of 0.134. One explanation is that there were limited ways of environmental grievance in the Chinese context because of the lack of government monitoring controls over corporate environmental performance (Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, our result also suggests the suitability of factors with Bartlett’s test of sphericity (x² = 3698.805, df = 946 and p < 0.01) that measures the probability of the correlation matrix with other components, where the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure is 0.849 at 0.01 significance level. Lastly, we accounted for 51.885 per cent of the variation in our data based on the six factors yielded from the scales based on EFA. We further performed a reliability test, in which our Cronbach’s alphas are substantially above the critical value of 0.7. Based on the results from EFA, our results overall show sufficient convergent validity in each construct, which allows us to perform the following t-tests for hypothesis testing.\n\n|Items|Indicators|Indicators|Indicators| | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Environmental indicators|Economic indicators|Social indicators (labour and decent work)| |\n|1.
