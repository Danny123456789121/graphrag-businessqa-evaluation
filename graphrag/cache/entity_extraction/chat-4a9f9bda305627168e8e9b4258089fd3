The author concludes that the HR development practices focus mainly on current and ongoing needs, there is a lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, and the environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training. This also could be one of the factors contributing to the low correlation to the environmental aspect in this research.\n\nOther existing research relates to the role of HR department managers and was done by K. Drela [32]. The results of her research confirmed that HR managers of enterprises operating in the area of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship play a very active role in managing the initiatives related to sustainable development, and in introducing sustainability measures into corporate strategies. The results obtained by K. Drela further confirm and strengthen the role of HR in Corporate Sustainability.\n\nAs existing research results are not coherent, it seems worth consulting a wider-group research, encompassing varied employee groups and industry sectors to obtain a more comprehensive view on a national scale.\n\nThe limitations of the research group were also a limitation for this research. The research group represented only a part of the organizations operating in Podlasie. Furthermore, the research group was comprised of MBA students only. Hence, it encompassed only some members of the HR departments of the researched organizations. Therefore, one of the further research ideas include conducting the research with a bigger research group of Podlasie companies, and thus creating a more complete database for the country.\n\nMoreover, further research could also focus on other regions within the country to contribute to a wider data collection. The research model created in this research has wide applications, as it can be used in research without geographical limitations. It can also be utilized in varied sectors (public or business) and branches of the economy. What is more, the research in particular regions could be repeated on a regular basis. The results thereof could serve as the basis for following the process of Corporate Sustainability implementation.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nB.M. and A.W. confirm that their contribution in each stage of the preparation of this article was equal.
