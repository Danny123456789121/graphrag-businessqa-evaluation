Climate sensitivity in high and low temperature-variation states\n\nWe retrieve state-level temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center, and rank the U.S. states according to the standard deviation of the state-level temperature from 1953 to 2015. We define the 10 states with the highest standard deviation of temperatures as high temperature-variation states (H), and the 10 states with the lowest standard deviation of temperatures as low temperature-variation states (L). We run time-series regressions to examine if firms in high temperature-variation states are more negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in low temperature-variation states. Section “Industry portfolios” present the results for five industry portfolios, those for the size-value portfolios are shown in Section “Size-value portfolios”.
