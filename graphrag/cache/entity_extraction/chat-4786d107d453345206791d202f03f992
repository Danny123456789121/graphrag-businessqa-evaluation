By applying AHP steps and using MATLAB software, the importance\n\nweights of dimensions (Weco, Wenv, Wsoc) are (0.618, 0.297, 0.086), respectively, with a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.07 (see Table 3). The economic factor is the most significant dimension in selecting a supplier for the DMs, with the highest value of priority weights W = 0.618.\n\n# Table 3. Priority weights of evaluation criteria using the AHP method.\n\n|Dimensions|Weights|Criteria|Total Weights|Consistency|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|ECO (0.618)| |Eco1|0.350|CR = 0.090|\n| | |Eco2|0.067| |\n| | |Eco3|0.199| |\n|ENV (0.297)| |Env1|0.193|CR = 0.086|\n| | |Env2|0.038| |\n| | |Env3|0.066| |\n|SOC (0.086)| |Soc1|0.008|CR = 0.078|\n| | |Soc2|0.017| |\n| | |Soc3|0.060| |\n\nUnder the economic dimension, “Eco1: cost” is the most important criterion, with a total relative weight of 0.350. “Env1: reducing pollution” is the most important criterion under the environmental dimension, with a total weight of 0.193. Consequently, suppliers should focus on pollution reduction to help maintain an advantage over competing suppliers. “Soc3: responsibility to stakeholders and community” is the most significant criterion for supplier social consideration. The summary weights of the various dimensions and criteria presented in Table 3 are used as inputs in the BN model.\n\n# 3.2.2. DEMATEL for Direct Relations and Causal Graph\n\nThe decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is a tool determining importance and causal relationships amongst various evaluation criteria [35]. This method may confirm interdependence among variables. DEMATEL results in grouping factors into “cause” and “effect” categories between factors. DEMATEL is used to build the initial BN causal graph using the final direct relationship matrix [24]. The various steps of DEMATEL are outlined as follows:\n\nStep 1: Constructing the initial relationship matrices.\n\nAssume there are n identified evaluation criteria for supplier selection made by m decision-makers. Each decision-maker is asked to evaluate the direct influence of criterion ci on criterion c. This influencej is assigned an integer linguistic scale value including 0 (no influence), 1 (low influence), 2 (medium influence), 3 (high influence) and 4 (very high influence). X1, X2, X3, . . . , Xm form an initial relation matrix, Xk = [xijk], where k is the decision-maker participating in the evaluation process (1 ≤ k ≤ m).\n\nStep 2: Calculating the average matrix.\n\nTo aggregate all judgments from m decision-makers, the average matrix A = [aij] is calculated using expression (4):\n\nA = [aij] = 1/m ∑xijm k\n\nObtaining the normalized initial direct relation matrix.\n\nThe normalized initial direct relation matrix R = [rij], where rij (0, 1) can be obtained using expression (5).\n\nR = λ ∗ A\n\nλ = Min(max∑n=1|aij|,1≤j≤n∑n=1|aij|)\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\n# 10 of 23\n\nfactors. The value maxn∑nThe value maxn∑nj=1∣∣∣aij∣∣∣ indicates the value of the factor with the maximum direct effect on other 1≤i≤ i=1∣∣∣aij∣∣∣ is the factor which is most affected by other factors. A positive scalar matrix λ is the upper bound and allocates the lowest value of these two to itself. The matrix R is obtained by dividing each element of matrix A by a scalar value λ. Each rij element from matrix R is a value between zero and one.\n\n# Step 3: Calculating the total relation matrix.\n\nA continuous decrease in the indirect effects of problems along the powers of matrix R, e.g., R2, R3 . . . ., R∞, guarantees convergent solutions to the matrix inversion, similar to an absorbing Markov chain matrix. The full influence matrix F = [fij], where fij represents the full direct and indirect influence exerted by criterion ci on criterion c, can be determined using expression (6):\n\nF = R(1 − R)−1 (6)\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix.\n\n# Step 4: Calculating the total cause and effect including joint direct and indirect effects.\n\nEach row sum and column sum of matrix T is calculated using expressions (7) and (8), respectively:\n\nq = [qi]n×1 = [∑j=1n Fij] (7)\n\nP = [pj]n×1 = [∑i=1n Fij] (8)\n\nThe value qi indicates\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
