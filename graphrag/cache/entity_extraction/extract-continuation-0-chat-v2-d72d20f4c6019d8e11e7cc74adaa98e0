Baumgartner, Romana Rauter\n\n# Abstract\n\nSustainable development refers to an economic, environmental and social development that meets the needs of the present and does not prevent future generations from fulfilling their needs. In this context, businesses play an important role. However, progress towards sustainable development has been slow, indicating the need for more concrete guidance that will allow businesses to act strategically and successfully in a sustainable way. This theoretical paper connects three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management as viewed from the perspective of sustainability in order to encourage the integration of sustainability issues into corporate activities and strategies. These three dimensions are: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context. Sixteen propositions related to these dimensions have been developed to explore the contributions of corporate sustainability management to the creation of value for businesses, society and nature. This theoretical discussion contributes to existing research in that it reveals relationships between strategic management and sustainable development and provides an agenda for further empirical research.\n\n# Highlights\n\n- Links between corporate sustainability management and sustainability are discussed.\n- Perspectives of strategic management for sustainability management are explored.\n- Ways to integrate strategic thinking into sustainability management are presented.\n\n# Keywords\n\nStrategic management; sustainability; corporate sustainability management; strategy; sustainability performance; environmental and social governance\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nSustainable development, as defined by the Brundtland commission, tackles global environmental and social challenges and aims to provide a generic framework that allows the development of solutions that address these challenges (WCED, 1987). However, in its basic normative and ethical form, the concept of sustainable development offers no clear guidance with regard to which strategies, plans or activities need to be implemented. Consequently, a plethora of related guidelines and definitions have emerged. In order for the concept to become more binding, concrete and actionable, participation is required from numerous actors at various levels of society. Contributions from individuals, organizations, regions, states and societies are all relevant in any kind of sustainability-oriented development.\n\nThe focus in this paper has been placed on the role of industrial organizations in this process, since these play important roles in the transition of societies towards sustainability (the term sustainability is used here to describe the final goal of sustainable development, that is, a state where sustainability principles have been met (Broman and Robèrt, 2015)). Approaches such as corporate environmental management, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting have all been developed to help corporations manage various aspects of sustainability. Other examples are the integration of sustainability issues into cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000), the discussion of change management processes for corporate sustainability (Benn et al., 2014), integrated management systems to support corporate sustainability (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005), differences in institutional settings that influence corporate sustainability practices in the US and in Europe (Tschopp, 2005), or frameworks based on the EFQM model (van Marrewijk and Hardjono, 2003).\n\nHowever, the impacts of these approaches seem to be rather limited (Hopwood et al., 2005; Sneddon et al., 2006; Goncz et al. 2007). One reason for this is the lack of strategic orientation with respect to the introduction and implementation of sustainability-related practices and goals (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). In this paper, it is our intention to describe how the strategic relevance of sustainability management may be improved (i.e., in the sense that both business success and sustainable development may be reinforced). This line of reasoning follows the approach of Korhonen, who distinguished between two different levels of sustainability theory: that of generating favorable planning and management outcomes with respect to sustainable development, and that of concrete and practical action (K\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RUPERT J.
