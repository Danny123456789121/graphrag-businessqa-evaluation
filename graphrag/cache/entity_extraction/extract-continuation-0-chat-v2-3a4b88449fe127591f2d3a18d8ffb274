In the next two sections we review the relevant literature and the institutional details of the EU ETS. Section 4 discusses the theoretical arguments suggesting a relation between carbon emissions and stock returns. In Section 5 we describe the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 6 provides a framework for measuring the carbon premium in stock returns and discusses the main empirical results. In Section 7 we present empirical evidence on the price of carbon risk. Section 8 reports our findings on robustness and Section 9 extends our analysis by providing empirical evidence on the UK. Finally, Section 10 concludes.\n\n# 2 Literature Review\n\nThis paper is related to three distinct lines of research that focus on different aspects of the EU ETS. One line of research evaluates the effect of movements in the price for carbon allowances on the returns of different sets of European electrical power companies. For example, Oberndorfer (2009) and Veith, Werner and Zimmermann (2009) use data from Phase I (2005 to 2007), whereas Koch and Bassen (2013) extend their sample to 2010. These studies estimate the sensitivity of stock returns to changes in the price for carbon allowances, while also conditioning on other energy factors such as price changes in oil, gas, coal and electricity. Overall, this line of research establishes a positive relation between movements in the price of carbon allowances and movements in stock prices in the European power sector.\n\nA second line of research uses an event study methodology to isolate the effect of the sharp decline in the price of carbon allowances that took place in April 2006 on the stock returns of carbon-intensive European firms. These studies include Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) and Jong, Couwenberg and Woerdman (2014). They find that the drastic drop in carbon prices over a three-day window had a negative impact on the stock returns of carbon-intensive firms. This indicates that carbon regulation plays a significant role in determining the profits of dirty firms.\n\nFinally, a third line of research is based on a simulation methodology that makes assumptions about the technology underlying coal-generated and gas-generated power. This analysis is adopted by Sijm, Neuhoff and Chen (2006) and Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward and Grubb (2006), who show that the introduction of the EU ETS allows power companies to realize substantial windfall profits.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nA common thread across this body of research is that the main focus is to estimate the sensitivity (i.e., the beta) of stock returns to changes in carbon prices. In contrast, our empirical analysis is primarily concerned with the extent to which the abnormal excess return (i.e., the alpha) of a portfolio of dirty firms is higher than that of a portfolio of clean firms. Compared to the literature, we also adopt a different approach based on an asset pricing methodology applied on portfolios for a large set of stocks from many different industry sectors and for a longer sample. In the end, we make a distinct contribution to the literature by quantifying the effect of carbon regulation on German stock returns and the benefits to investors of holding carbon portfolios for the period when carbon allowances were granted for free.\n\n# 3 The EU Emissions Trading Scheme\n\nThe EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide (CO2). It covers about half of CO2 emissions in all EU member states, 40% of total greenhouse emissions, and involves about 11,500 factory installations that together emit 2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. For more information on the EU ETS see Ellerman, Convery and de Perthuis (2010) and World Bank (2014).\n\nThe EU ETS works as follows. First, it sets an annual cap on the overall emissions to be allowed. Second, it allocates allowances to emitters such that the sum of the allowances does not exceed the cap. The units in which allocations are measured are called the European Union Allowances (EUAs), which give polluters the right to emit one tonne of CO2. Note that the EUAs are given to individual installations (i.e., at the plant level, not the firm level). Third, the emitters choose how much to pollute. If they pollute more than the EUAs they have received, they must purchase extra EUAs from those who used less EUAs than they received, and vice versa. This system creates incentives to polluters to reduce emissions (e.g., through technological innovations) so they can sell the surplus EUAs for profit.\n\nAs seen in the timeline presented in Table 1, the EU ETS has been implemented in three separate phases. Phase I ran from January 2005 to December 2007, Phase II from January 2008 to December 2012, and Phase III currently runs from January 2013 to December 2019. For the first two phases, the EUAs were predominantly given to installations free of charge. Note that Phase I allowances could not be banked in Phase II and hence lost their value if unused. In the third phase, the majority of the EUAs are sold in auctions. Installations\n\nreceive annual allowances in March of every year which, if used, must be surrendered by the end of April of the following year. The penalty for noncompliance is e40 per EUA not surrendered in Phase I and e100 in Phase II. The end of April is also the date when externally verified emissions are made public for each EU country. The EUAs can be traded in several trading platforms, notably the European Climate Exchange (ECX) in London, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Leipzig, and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EU ETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide, covering about half of CO2 emissions in all EU member states.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>GEO<|>The European Union is a political and economic union of member states located primarily in Europe, involved in the EU ETS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSHNELL, CHONG AND MANSUR<|>PERSON<|>Bushnell, Chong, and Mansur are researchers who conducted studies on the impact of carbon prices on stock returns of carbon-intensive firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JONG, Couwenberg AND WOERDMAN<|>PERSON<|>Jong, Couwenberg, and Woerdman are researchers who analyzed the effects of carbon price declines on stock returns of European firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOCH AND BASSEN<|>PERSON<|>Koch and Bassen are researchers who extended studies on the relationship between carbon allowances and stock returns in the European power sector.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sijm, Neuhoff AND CHEN<|>PERSON<|>Sijm, Neuhoff, and Chen are researchers who analyzed the technology underlying coal-generated and gas-generated power in relation to the EU ETS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMEAL, HARTLEY, HEPBURN, WARD AND GRUBB<|>PERSON<|>Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward, and Grubb are researchers who studied the windfall profits realized by power companies due to the EU ETS.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU ETS<|>EU<|>The EU ETS is a program implemented within the European Union to regulate carbon emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSHNELL, CHONG AND MANSUR<|>EU ETS<|>Bushnell, Chong, and Mansur conducted studies related to the EU ETS and its impact on stock returns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONG, Couwenberg AND WOERDMAN<|>EU ETS<|>Jong, Couwenberg, and Woerdman analyzed the effects of carbon price declines within the context of the EU ETS<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOCH AND BASSEN<|>EU ETS<|>Koch and Bassen extended research on the EU ETS and its impact on stock returns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Sijm, Neuhoff AND CHEN<|>EU ETS<|>Sijm, Neuhoff, and Chen studied the technology related to the EU ETS<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMEAL, HARTLEY, HEPBURN, WARD AND GRUBB<|>EU ETS<|>Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward, and Grubb researched the financial implications of the EU ETS for power companies<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
