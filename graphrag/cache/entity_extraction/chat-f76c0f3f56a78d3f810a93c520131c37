He noted that GAI allows them to get the answers they need much faster. However, many AI skeptics are still concerned about the potential impact of technology on people. They noted that it could lead to the development of false information and the loss of jobs [12, 38]. Some of the issues they are worried about include the noise in the data, which could lead to costly errors, and the threat of bias. One of the most common copyright issues that could arise is the ownership of intellectual property (IP). One industry tech officer stated that the complexity of this issue makes it one of the most challenging factors to address.\n\nAI aims to get the bots to the point where they can become human-like. Some mental health apps are currently testing ChatGPT, which has been designed to provide users with answers to their questions [39]. However, there are still many issues that companies must address to protect their users’ privacy and safety. When adopting AI, one of the most critical factors that corporate boards should consider is establishing a strategy to address the ethical issues associated with the technology, as this could attract attention from ESG investors.\n\nThe launch of OpenAI’s latest GPT was motivated by the increasing number of countries looking to use AI. China is one of these countries that sees the potential of GAI to challenge the US. In recent years, the government has been restricted from accessing advanced chips. The logistics industry feels that it is irresponsible for companies not to use AI to reduce the environmental impact of their operations.\n\n# 10. Policy Framework to Overcome Limitations of GAI\n\nDespite the inception of GAI models, their full potential and impact are yet to be seen, which leaves uncertainties surrounding their use. While proponents of GAI models claim that they can produce compelling outputs, the models can also be biased due to being built on societal and internet biases, which could enable criminal activity or unethical behavior [34]. For instance, ChatGPT does not provide instructions on how to hot-wire a car, but it will comply if you tell it to do so to save a baby. Organizations using GAI models must consider the potential risks of publishing biased or copyrighted content.\n\nDespite the risks, GAI models can still be used safely. One of the most critical steps organizations should take is to ensure that the data they use for training their models are unbiased. They should also consider using specialized models. Organizations with more\n\nresources can customize their GAI tools to fit their requirements and minimize biases while ensuring that a human checks the outputs before they are published or used. The rapid emergence and evolution of GAI models has highlighted the immense potential of this technology. However, the landscape is still very unpredictable. In the coming years, new models will be introduced and tested regularly. The regulatory environment will also change as this technology becomes more widely used [36, 40]. As organizations start experimenting with GAI models, they should monitor the changes in the regulatory environment.\n\nTo effectively utilize GAI, executives should first identify the parts of their organization that could be affected by the technology and establish a mechanism to monitor its progress. Prior to the implementation of GAI, executives must identify the areas of their organization that it could potentially affect. For example, should we wait for the technology to evolve or develop new business models, or invest in pilots? Furthermore, should the approach vary across different areas of the organization? A good starting point would be to establish a cross-functional team consisting of data scientists, legal experts, and functional business leaders.\n\nTo establish an effective ecosystem, it is important to develop partnerships and platforms. Before implementing GAI, executives must identify the areas of their organization that could be impacted by it. As existing models have limitations, the company should have a clear strategy for identifying use cases and ensuring that the models comply with community and legal standards [37]. Encouraging thoughtful innovation is also crucial for organizations, and this can be achieved by creating sandboxed environments and implementing regulations to prevent unauthorized use.\n\nFor creators and developers, responsible AI practices and principles should be followed. Some leading platforms, such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have committed to this matter [41]. In response to the increasing number of complaints about the quality of its search results, Google has updated its guidelines for search raters. These new guidelines are designed to help them evaluate the company’s search ranking systems for providing relevant and helpful information. Some of the world’s leading platforms, such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have dedicated significant resources to developing responsible models. They should prioritize developing agile and iterative processes to ensure their platforms have the tools and resources to respond efficiently to events [26, 28]. For instance, OpenAI has a robust approach to addressing the issue of harmful prompts by implementing a crowdsourcing method for ChatGPT. They should also reinforce the use of generative AI by educating people about its capabilities [42]. Although these tools are helpful, they are not perfect. Commercial and individual users should also have access to more information about how these models work.\n\nIf users are interested in learning more about how GAI can be used to create content, it is important to apply a critical lens to its development. Since it can produce content alongside human-generated content, it is crucial to avoid taking any content at face value [43]. When using GAI to create content, it is crucial to apply a critical lens and verify the accuracy of the information. To maintain integrity in one’s work, tools to identify and add citations to AI-generated content should be considered. Additionally, it is important to recognize that generative models do not consider the concept of confidence when responding to questions, so additional research may be necessary to verify the accuracy of the data generated by these models [44, 45].\n\nAlthough GAI tools have the potential to be used ethically,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
