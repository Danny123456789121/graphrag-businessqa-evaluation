Furthermore, drawing on agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976), scholars suggested that managers could opportunistically employ corporate resources to engage in environmental activities that enhance their own utility at the expense of good financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2008). For instance, managers may try to justify disappointing financial outcomes by engaging in conspicuous environmental activities (Preston and O’Bannon 1997).\n\nIn contrast, other scholars have argued that CEP can have a positive impact on CFP. Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995) noted that pollution can be seen as a waste of resources and thus the reduction of a firm’s environmental footprint may also strengthen its competitiveness leading to a “win–win” situation. In particular, the NRBV (e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provides arguments for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities (both tangible and intangible), leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan 2005; Hart and Dowell 2011). Thus, proactive environmental strategies focusing on pollution prevention and environmentally sound product development may entail the development of organizational resources and capabilities and stimulate organizational learning (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Hence, improving CEP may help in attracting and retaining a higher quality workforce (Turban and Greening 1996), may foster innovativeness (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Surroca et al. 2010), and may enhance decision-making.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nprocesses and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman and Keim 2001; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).\n\nAlong the lines of Freeman’s (1984) stakeholder theory, it has been proposed that firms’ engagement towards improving CEP can be seen as potentially instrumental in obtaining necessary resources or stakeholder support and in mitigating the likelihood of negative regulatory, legislative, or fiscal action (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Cheng et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Jones 1995). Thus, superior CEP can increase customer demand (Hart and Dowell 2011), may improve reputation (Hart 1995), can contribute towards gaining legitimacy as a “license to operate” (Porter and Kramer 2006, p. 81), may decrease financial risk (Peloza 2009), and attract financial resources from environmentally responsible investors (Consolandi et al. 2009; Heal 2005).\n\nIn sum, there are several channels and causal pathways through which CEP might positively affect CFP. Moreover, the meta-analytic results provided so far are in favor of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, while these meta-analyses did not incorporate the data provided by event studies, a meta-analytic examination of event study results would be particularly useful because event studies, despite some critical issues concerning the proper design and sound application (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999), exhibit several outstanding features.\n\nFirst, focusing on stock market reactions obviates the need to analyze accounting-based measures of CFP, which may be subjected to potential manipulations due to choices regarding different accounting procedures (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; Richard et al. 2009). Moreover, while accounting-based measures of CFP are limited in that they entail a historical perspective (Hamann et al. 2013; Peloza 2009; Richard et al. 2009), stock market returns incorporate assessments of a firm’s prospective development and reflect the notion of external stakeholders, especially investors, regarding future performance (Fryxell and Barton 1990; Hamann et al. 2013). Thus, event studies imply a forward-looking view on the financial consequences of CEP. This point is of crucial importance because several potentially beneficial impacts of CEP are considered to accrue in the long term (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Peloza 2009). In addition, stock market returns also incorporate intangible assets and reputation effects (Richard et al. 2009), which are obviously relevant given the theoretically proposed mechanism linking CEP and CFP.\n\nAnother advantage of event studies for examining the CEP–CFP link is that they can rather clearly determine the direction of causality (Heal 2005). While correlation and regression-based studies in most instances cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality or endogeneity, issues that are likely to be at play in the relationship between CEP and CFP (Endrikat et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Hart and Ahuja 1996; Surroca et al. 2010); event studies reasonably allow inferring causality running from CEP to CFP.3\n\nFurthermore, as several third variables (either of moderating or mediating nature) have been suggested to be involved in the CEP–CFP link (Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Russo and Minto 2012), it is of crucial importance to control for such factors in empirical tests in order to ensure valid and reliable results.4 In this regard, event studies “are unusually precise because companies serve as their own matched control when its stock price is compared before versus after a news announcement” (Margolis et al. 2009, pp. 13–14).\n\nDue to the advantageous properties of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>J.
