However, there are articles contemplating the environmental pillar together with other pillars (social or economic, or both). The social pillar, separated from the environmental pillar, was the least explored, and only the article of Ramachandran (2011) was found. It should be noted that the economic pillar, although not used as a search string (since it is not part of the scope of this paper), is still evidenced from 2008. This is justified because many papers\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\nDealing with some pillar of sustainability (environmental or social) usually relate this analysis to the economic question.\n\n# Fig. 5. Evolution of sustainability pillars over the years\n\n|20| | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|15| | | | |\n|10| | | | |\n|5| | | | |\n|0|1998|2001|2002|2004|\n| |2007|2008|2010|2011|\n| |2012|2013|2014|2015|\n| |2016|2017|2018|Feb-19|\n\nEnvironmental\n\nEnvironmental + Social\n\nEnvironmental + Economic\n\nSocial + Economic\n\nEnvironmental + Social + Economic\n\nIn relation to the sustainability pillar, we found that most studies dealing with the environmental pillar in conjunction with other pillars still have a major focus on the environmental pillar. In this sense, most capabilities studied are related to the environmental pillar, which is why the findings of this research are focused mainly on this pillar.\n\n# Fig. 6\n\nShows business arrangement where the studies were conducted. Most articles studied the context of individual firms, often identifying the industry of which the companies were a part. A low number of studies did not identify this sector. A considerable part of the works analyzed OCSs from the point of view of supply chains and, to a small extent, in the context of multinationals. The study of OCSs in the context of industrial clusters was conducted by only one research. This can be explained by Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008), who argued that most studies have examined environmental capabilities internally, leaving aside the moderating role of business environment characteristics (e.g., spillover effects) and the cooperation between organizations through clustering for the implementation of sustainable initiatives.\n\nSome studies focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which is interesting, since there are particularities in these companies such as reduced capital, centralization of functions, among others, that hinder the development of OCSs. Deepening studies focusing on this subject are still relevant since it is still scarce.\n\n# Fig. 6. Business arrangement\n\n|Companies in a particular industry| |Supply chain|Small and medium enterprises|Companies in unidentified sector|Multinationals|Clusters|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|25|22|20|15|12|10| |\n|6|5|2|1|0| | |\n\nTable 1 shows the industrial sectors in which empirical research was developed. The manufacturing sector is the most representative, followed by chemical industries, construction industry and food industry/agri-food. Although there are more studies focusing on industrial sector, the service sector, specifically hotels and resorts, comes in third place. A wide variety of sectors aside those where environmental impacts are clearer (e.g., manufacturing, chemical industry, construction and industrial wastes) were also addressed (such as technology and services). This indicates that sustainability has been receiving attention by all business sectors.\n\n# Table 1.

Countries with advanced economies, such as the US, followed by the UK and Germany, have a greater number of\n\nstudies. In addition, it can be observed that most researches were conducted in developed economies. Some have been conducted in developing economies such as China and Malaysia.
