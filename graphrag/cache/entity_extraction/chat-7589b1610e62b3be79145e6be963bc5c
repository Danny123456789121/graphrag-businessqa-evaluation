Overall, my results corroborate the existing meta-analytic evidence of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP by demonstrating.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nthat there is a positive market reaction to positive CEP-related events and a negative reaction to negative events. Moreover, due to the nature of event studies, these meta-analytically derived estimates indicate a positive causal impact of CEP on CFP. CEP-related events indeed appear to alter the market’s perception of firms’ net present values of future profits and cash flows (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). However, what is not clear from the current meta-analysis is the exact reason why CEP-related events change the stock market’s perception of future firm value. Along the lines of the NRBV and the stakeholder theory, it could be argued that CEP-related events are effective in signaling a firm’s competitive resources and capabilities and its potential effectiveness in meeting stakeholder demands. Nevertheless, which potential benefits from superior CEP and which detriments from poor CEP are in particular valued or punished by the market remains to be established.\n\nFurthermore, the findings suggest that there is asymmetry in the stock market reactions with stronger reactions to negative than to positive CEP-related events. The asymmetry can be explained in the light of the so-called negativity bias, a pattern that may be “one of the most basic and far-reaching psychological principles” (Baumeister et al. 2001, p. 362). To this end, the findings are in line with insights from economic psychology indicating asymmetric evaluations of potential losses and gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Hence, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events might just mirror a general cognitive pattern. However, from a more specific point of view, it can be argued that negative CEP-related events such as announcements of violations of environmental laws (e.g., Karpoff et al. 1998) or toxic releases (e.g., Hamilton 1995) demonstrate poor CEP in a clear and explicit manner. Thus, negative CEP-related events appear to constitute strong and (adversely) value-relevant signals for the shareholders. Contrarily, positive CEP-related events such as announcements of green supply chain initiatives (Bose and Pal 2012) or engagement in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program (Keele and DeHart 2011) strictly speaking may just represent a firm’s efforts not necessarily implying actual superior CEP. Accordingly, positive CEP-related events might not in all cases entail information that is sufficient to alter the shareholder’s evaluation of firm value. In addition, the asymmetric stock market impacts of positive and negative CEP-related events might be explained by information asymmetries prior to the events. Superior CEP might be already factored in by the markets, as firms with superior CEP are likely to publicize pertinent information, while poor performing firms would tend to withhold such information so that the “surprise” effect is much stronger for negative events (Consolandi et al. 2009; Doh et al. 2010). Future research may expand on the asymmetry issue and explore the reasons for the asymmetric market reactions to CEP-related events in more detail.\n\nWith regard to the examination of potential moderation effects, this work only found a significant moderation effect for the length of the event windows. For negative events the population r for longer windows was significantly smaller than that for the (-1, 1) window. For positive CEP-related events only the population r for the (-1, 1) window was significant while a significant population r for longer event windows was not found. From a theoretical point of view, this finding further highlights the more material effect of negative CEP-related events compared to positive events. Negative CEP-related events appear to entail stock market reactions that are stronger and more persistent over time compared with the reactions to positive events. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, this finding provides support for the recommendations of McWilliams and Siegel (1997) to use event windows that are as short as possible. Contrary to the argument of Barnett and King (2008) proposing that the market may need some time to capture the full impact of certain events, the current findings suggest that the market is able to factor in the information revealed by CEP-related events rapidly.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that the length of the event window was the only statistically significant moderation effect that was detected in the current work. While the width of the confidence intervals and the significance of the Q statistics for most of the subgroups indicated that the variation of the findings of the event studies included in the analysis was above that expected by chance, the subgroups failed to capture these effects. That means, while subgroup analyses indicated the presence of moderation effects, the particular effects could not be specified.\n\nThe failure of the present meta-analysis to reveal moderation effects that would adequately explain the observed heterogeneity clearly suggests a need for further research to identify moderation effects, attributed to both methodology and theory that may explain the variation in the study findings. For example, scholars may explore whether country-specific differences may entail moderation effects regarding the stock market reactions to CEP-related events. The current meta-analysis showed that regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions seem to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples. Since several factors that are likely to influence stock market reactions to CEP-related events are dependent on country-specific institutional contexts (e.g., Bansal and Roth 2000; Baughn et al. 2007; Etzion 2007), future research exploring the national context-specific mechanisms that may account for the differences in more detail might yield important insights.\n\n# Market\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
