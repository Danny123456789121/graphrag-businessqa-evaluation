These moderation effects may emerge from systematic differences with regard to the applied statistical procedures or other study settings (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). For example, several scholars have argued that misspecified models (i.e., models that do not account for important determinants of the relationship) may be the reason for the inconsistency of the empirical results (e.g., McWilliams & Siegel, 2000; Surroca et al., 2010; Telle, 2006). These determinants may be correlated with either one or both of the focal constructs and can take the form of moderating variables, mediating variables or confounding variables (Orlitzky, 2008). Since the CEP–CFP studies differ considerably with regard to the extent to which they have controlled for these determinants, study findings are likely to vary due to differences concerning this matter.\n\nFirm size has been suggested as a determinant of both CEP and CFP (Ullmann, 1985). According to Etzion (2007), firm size, rather than being a determinant factor in itself, may proxy several other firm characteristics that affect the focal relationship. For example, larger firms are more exposed to publicity and stakeholder scrutiny and face greater risks of litigation, making them more likely to focus on environmental issues (Clarkson, Li et al., 2011; Konar & Cohen, 2000). Moreover, larger firms tend to possess more (slack) resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) that allow them to invest in environmental activities (Clarkson, Li et al., 2011). It has also been shown that firm size is positively associated with CFP for reasons such as economies of scale, better access to resources, or greater control over stakeholders (e.g., Gooding & Wagner, 1985; Orlitzky, 2001).\n\nBecause industries differ regarding their environmental impact (i.e., high- vs. low-polluting industries), factors such as the regulatory context, pressures from stakeholders, or a firm’s general ability to lower its environmental impact vary between industries (Etzion, 2007; Patten, 2002). Moreover, Russo and Fouts (1997) showed that industry growth may moderate the relationship between CEP and CFP such that the relationship strengthens in high-growth industries. Also the intensity of competition, which differs between industries, may influence the focal relationship (Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; McWilliams & Siegel, 2000). Hence, many studies have found evidence for a moderating effect of the type of industry (e.g., Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Waddock & Graves, 1997; Wagner, 2010), which, however, may be caused by several reasons. In addition, the type of industry may also have confounding influences pertaining to the focal relationship, as the type of industry may also determine CFP (Porter, 1985), separately from CEP.\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that firms with better CEP tend to incur lower levels of financial risk (e.g., Feldman, Soyka, & Ameer, 199\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
