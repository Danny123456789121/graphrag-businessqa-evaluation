These are positions that help reduce the negative impact on the natural environment by improving the ecological quality of products, services, and technological processes [61].\n\nGreen HR practices should be implemented in a precisely planned HR strategy as part of the overall strategy concept. It is also important to study the company’s strategy and culture, because they determine the effectiveness and efficiency of green HRM.\n\nThe strategic perspective of Sustainable HRM explores the links between sustainable and strategic HRM. This approach highlights the impact that sustainable HRM has on traditional HR spheres, such\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\n# 7 of 21\n\nas recruitment and selection, employee rotation, aspects of evaluation, and employment opportunities within the organization. The task of HR is to achieve organizational goals that not only bring monetary benefits [19]. The main assumptions of this approach are the belief that people create a lasting competitive advantage and that achieving it enables sustainable management of human resources. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that related policies are still under review and analysis.\n\nThe Human Resource Planning Society defines five key knowledge areas for HR practitioners [22]:\n\n- HR strategy and planning,\n- leadership development,\n- talent management,\n- organizational effectiveness, and\n- building a strategic HR function.\n\nLosey et al. [63] described numerous opportunities in the realm of sustainability for HR to bring important operational competencies and to exert strategic leadership.\n\nThe model presented in Figure 1 will be verified in an empirical study relating to enterprises in Podlasie. To this end, the main hypothesis was formulated and adopted. It reads as follows: In enterprises operating in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, there is a relationship between the use of sustainable development practices by HR departments and their introduction to the company’s development strategy. The main hypothesis will be verified in a following empirical study.\n\n# PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE\n\n# SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE\n\n# GREEN PERSPECTIVE\n\nH1\n\nH2\n\nH3\n\nHR DEPARTMENT\n\nH4\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nFigure 1. Research model of Sustainable Human Resource Management. Source: Own elaboration on the base of Rompa [48].\n\n# 2. Materials and Methods\n\n# 2.1. Research Area and Research Population\n\nThe location of the research and selection of the research sample is purposeful, as the Podlaskie Voivodeship, located in the north-eastern part of Poland, is unique in the scale of the country in the perspective of natural, social, and economic scale. Its character is determined by areas of natural value. The legally protected areas with special natural values are built of the total area of national parks, nature reserves, landscape parks, protected landscape areas, documentation stands, ecological lands, and nature and landscape complexes. Taking into account the entire area of NATURA 2000, at least 40% of the area of the Podlaskie Voivodeship is covered by some form of nature protection. Those are unique places, on a European scale, barely changed by human activity.\n\nPodlaskie Voivodeship, compared to other regions in Poland, is the least industrialized. Its share in domestic industrial production is only about 1.7%.\n\nThe main sectors of the economy of the Podlaskie Voivodeship are also closely related to the specificity of the region, which is characterized by high air quality and rich natural resources, used.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\n# 2.1. Economic Sectors of the Podlaskie Voivodeship\n\nThe main sectors of the economy of the Podlaskie Voivodeship are also closely related to the specificity of the region, which is characterized by high air quality and rich natural resources, used in a sustainable way. Branches of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, in which the region has above average potential, include [64]:\n\n- Agri-food sector and sectors connected with it by the value chain,\n- metal and machine industry, boatbuilding, and sectors related to it by the value chain,\n- medical sector and life sciences and sectors related to it by the value chain, and\n- eco-innovation, environmental sciences, and sectors related to it by the value chain (including renewable energy sources, resource-efficient construction, and efficient wood processing).\n\nThe Podlasie region is also unique in terms of culture and religions. For centuries, Podlasie served as both a political and national border, where the Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian ethnos intertwined. Companies in the Podlaskie Voivodeship operate in a religious plurality which stems from the area’s location and history. Its multinational character provided a solid background for the creation of distinct systems of values and attitudes [65]. Podlasie is one of the most religiously diverse regions in Poland. The Catholic and Orthodox congregations constitute 77% and 13.5% of all inhabitants of Podlaskie Voivodeship, respectively (in some districts, for example in the Hajnowski district, over 80% of the inhabitants are Orthodox Church believers) [65].\n\nThe research was conducted on a group of 73 participants of MBA studies at the J\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PODLASKIE VOIVODESHIP<|>GEO<|>Podlaskie Voivodeship is a region in north-eastern Poland known for its natural value and low industrialization, with significant areas under nature protection including national parks and nature reserves.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN HRM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Green HRM refers to human resource management practices that promote ecological sustainability and encourage environmentally friendly behaviors within organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Human Resource Planning Society defines key knowledge areas for HR practitioners and emphasizes the importance of sustainable HR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURA 2000<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATURA 2000 is a network of protected areas across Europe aimed at ensuring the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MBA STUDIES<|>EVENT<|>MBA studies refer to a graduate-level program that provides advanced education in business management and administration.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODLASKIE VOIVODESHIP<|>GREEN HRM<|>The practices of Green HRM are relevant to the ecological initiatives and natural resource management in the Podlaskie Voivodeship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODLASKIE VOIVODESHIP<|>HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING SOCIETY<|>The Human Resource Planning Society's guidelines can influence HR practices in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, particularly in sustainable development<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODLASKIE VOIVODESHIP<|>NATURA 2000<|>Podlaskie Voivodeship contains areas that are part of the NATURA 2000 network, highlighting its ecological significance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MBA STUDIES<|>HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING SOCIETY<|>MBA studies may include training on the key knowledge areas defined by the Human Resource Planning Society<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
