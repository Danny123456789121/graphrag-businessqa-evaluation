The toxic release inventory (TRI), the US Environmental Protection Agency’s data measuring toxic chemical releases and waste management activities (EPA 2008), is a commonly used proxy for evaluating environmental performance in CEP–CFP studies. As some researchers have pointed out, however, that the TRI data is primarily a measure of chemical emissions, not a comprehensive indicator of a firm’s total environmental performance (e.g., Ambec and Lanoie 2008; Sharma and Starik).\n\n2002). Thus, the conclusions drawn from the results of such studies may or may not be capturing the true picture of the environmental performance–financial performance link. In this meta-analysis, we hope to clarify the issue of whether the use of different measures of environmental performance (i.e., TRI vs. others) has a substantive effect on the CEP–CFP relationship. This clarification should shed light on the importance of environmental performance operationalizations, in turn guiding future research. Additionally, it will help inform managers as to whether it is pollution reduction alone or other environmental performance indicators that matter to the firm’s bottom line.\n\n# Self-Report Measures\n\nAnother measurement concern that has been raised in this body of work is the issue of the potential inherent bias in the practice of surveying managers who provide self-reported measures of their firm’s environmental performance (Sharma 2001). For example, managers may perceive that their firms are really greener than they actually are. The question of the objectivity of self-report questionnaires is not unique to the corporate environmental performance literature, but has been debated by academicians for a number of years. Some researchers argue that self-reports create major threats to validity (e.g., social desirability, selective memory, etc.) making them a fallible source of data (e.g., Schwarz 1999). In contrast, others argue that while all methodologies have weaknesses, the variance resulting from the use of survey methodology is minimal and not problematic if researchers give proper consideration to addressing potential validity threats (e.g., Howard 1994; Schmitt 1994). Moreover, they claim that self-reports may actually provide advantages over other methods because they are a useful tool for accessing perceptions (Spector 1994) and are easy to administer (Howard 1994). We systematically examine the CEP–CFP literature to determine whether the use of self-report measures of environmental performance results in different outcomes than the use of archival data (e.g., KLD, TRI, etc.). Again, addressing this issue through a meta-analysis will inform researchers as to whether performance differences exist based on the type of measure.\n\n# Method\n\n# Sample\n\nWe conducted an extensive search for reported correlations between indicators of CEP and CFP in the primary journals from multiple disciplines, including management, accounting, marketing, economics, and finance from 1970 through 2009. Our initial search used keywords including corporate environmental performance, environmental performance, environment, CEP, sustainability, corporate sustainability, green, green business, environmental strategy, social responsibility, corporate social responsibility, CSR, and environmental responsibility. In addition to electronic searches using EBSCO and ProQuest databases and manual searches of journals, we identified and examined potential articles from the sources cited in our retrieved article set, which resulted in a total of 72 studies in the original dataset. Any CEP–CFP Pearson product–moment correlation, reported directly or derived from reported t or d statistics was included in the analysis. The product–moment correlations were transformed using Fisher’s Z transformation. This resulted in a total of 39 usable studies with 202 samples that examined the CEP–CFP relationship. The large sample to study ratio resulted from several studies that included multiple operationalizations of CEP, CFP, or both. Consistent with the meta-analytical approach used in management literature, each of the authors independently analyzed and coded the CEP and CFP operationalizations. After comparing results, the authors arrived at a consensus for coding papers with multiple operationalizations. To ensure statistical independence, multiple correlations within moderator groups derived from the same samples were aggregated by calculating the mean of the correlations (Lipsey and Wilson 2001). This conservative approach resulted in 71 usable samples (n = 22,869).\n\n# Procedure\n\nModerators were coded collectively by the authors based on characteristics of the measures and samples using the approach outlined above. Reactive environmental approaches included measures of compliance with legal requirements (e.g., TRI, fines and penalties), whereas proactive environmental strategies were coded based on environmental initiatives beyond regulatory requirements (e.g., sustainable development, employee involvement). In some cases, both approaches were reflected in a measure (e.g., KLD) and were coded accordingly. Several studies explicitly examined CEP for small firms (e.g., local utilities), which we compared against the majority of studies using large firms only (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Similarly, studies using US-based samples were compared to studies using international-based samples. Several articles also explicitly used “worst offenders” as their sample by studying only high polluting industries (e.g., oil and gas, heavy manufacturing, EPA lists, etc.), which we compared to all others. The methodological moderators are fairly straightforward: financial performance measures were coded as either profitability (e.g., ROA) or market (e.g., market share); emissions measures included TRI, air pollution measures, waste disposal, etc.; and\n\n# Results\n\nTable 1 provides the meta-analytic results for the overall relationship between CEP and CFP.
