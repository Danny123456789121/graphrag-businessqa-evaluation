But, much of the evidence of previous literature provides qualitative descriptions regarding the nature, contents and motivational factors of CSD (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001, Newson and Deegan, 2002, Campbell, 2007, Van Beurden and Gössling, 2008, Uzma, 2016, Neu et al., 1998, Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975, Teoh and Thong, 1984, Guthrie and Parker, 1989, Andrew et al., 1989, Guthrie and Parker, 1990, Roberts, 1992, Patten, 1992, Clarkson, 1995, Donaldson and Preston, 1995, Deegan and Gordon, 1996, Adams et al., 1998, Adams et al., 1995, Deegan and Rankin, 1997).\n\nIn the existing literature, a microscopic research has been investigated on the determinants of CSD as well, e.g., (Hackston and Milne, 1996, Alnajjar, 2000, Naser et al., 2006, Hawani Wan Abd Rahman et al., 2011, Giannarakis, 2013, Muttakin and Khan, 2014, Giannarakis, 2014b, Barakat et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Nurhayati et al., 2016).\n\nMoreover, there is relatively less devotion has been given to set up a direct link between CG and CSD (Khan et al., 2013, Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Sufian and Zahan, 2013, Giannarakis, 2014a, Kiliç et al., 2015, Deschênes et al., 2015, Majeed et al., 2015, D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Dunn and Sainty, 2009, Ibrahim and Hanefah, 2016, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007).\n\nThe empirical findings of the previous literature in connection to CG and CSD provide inconclusive results. For example, Dunn and Sainty (2009) and Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016) provide evidence that board independence has a significant impact on CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Razak and Mustapha (2013) suggests that no significant impact of board independence on CSD. Besides that, Javaid Lone et al. (2016) documented that there is a significant link between board size and CSD. However, Razak and Mustapha (2013) show the insignificant relationship between board size and CSD. In addition, Majeed et al. (2015) find that board gender diversity has a significant impact on CSD.\n\nside, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) provide evidence that no significant impact exists between board gender diversity and CSD.\n\nContrary to previous findings above, our study aims to address the meta-analysis technique for finding out the links on the corporate governance and corporate social disclosures. In this context, this paper synthesizes 29 previous studies by conducting the meta-analysis technique developed by Hunter et al. (1982) to give a fruitful result on the CG and CSD relationship.\n\nThe social science researcher is more devoting on the use of meta-analysis technique but limited applications by the researcher of accounting (Eddine et al., 2015, Khlif and Souissi, 2010, Ahmed and Courtis, 1999). To the best of our awareness, no prior studies examined the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures by using the meta-analysis technique. Hence, this study contributes to the contemporary literature to fill up this research gap. Furthermore, the findings of the investigation present a combined result of the prior studies based on different countries which are ultimately providing a better understanding to assess the determinants of corporate social disclosures. Moreover, this meta-analysis technique adds contributions not only in the accounting research arena but also other areas of research.\n\nIn the present study, the meta-analysis incorporates twelve corporate governance variables as explanatory variables. These variables are board independence, board Size, board gender diversity, the frequency of board meetings, the composition of non-executive directors, CEO duality, auditors’ credibility, government ownership, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership, and concentrated ownership. The study results imply that there is a significant positive relationship exists between board Size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility with Corporate Social Disclosures (CSD). Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, there is an insignificant positive association finds between board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership. CEO duality is also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study further investigates that the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study. The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.\n\nThe rest parts of the article proceed as follows.
