For example, an improved customer experience due to GAI application may result in a loss of agency for employees, leading to lower job morale and engagement. Such friction can likely...\n\n# Co-creation of Value\n\n# Co-destruction of Value\n\n# HT Firm\n\n# REFLECT\n\n# Strategic Management\n\n# Destinations\n\n# Marketing\n\n# Operations\n\n# Resource-Based View\n\n# Financial\n\n# Ethical\n\n# Revenue Management\n\n# Accounting\n\n# Finance\n\n# Human Resources\n\n# Educational\n\n# Cultural\n\n# Legal\n\n# Design\n\n# Technological\n\n# Co-creation of Value\n\n# Co-destruction of Value\n\nFigure 1.

According to stakeholder theory, a company should create value for all stakeholders, rather than solely focusing on shareholders (Freeman et al., 2010). This theory combines the resource-based view and market-based view of the firm, while also considering sociopolitical factors (Phillips, 2003). It is important to note that stakeholder theory serves as a framework, providing a basis for various derived theories and models (Freeman et al., 2010), such as the one offered in the present study.\n\nConsidering the objective of our study, which aims to propose a framework ensuring that future research on GAI remains relevant to practical hospitality and tourism management, we developed the REFLECT model through an inductive analysis of authors’ writings. These writings, in turn, were based on prompts that prioritize the significance of stakeholders (Freeman et al., 2010). Furthermore, since GAI is a novel technology with potential applications in the hospitality industry, it presents both promising opportunities and ethical, legal, social, and economic challenges. Adopting a more inclusive and balanced approach that considers the needs and experiences of multiple stakeholders can facilitate ethical decision-making and foster mutually beneficial relationships, ultimately contributing to sustainable organizational success in GAI implementation.\n\nThe components and dynamics of the REFLECT model are thematically consistent with other frameworks that have been devised based on stakeholder theory (see Freudenreich et al., 2020; Mihailova et al., 2022), and, in this study, emphasize sustainable value creation via GAI application for HT firms. As follows, this manuscript integrates the perspectives of more than 30 hospitality and tourism academics and/or practitioners in terms of (1) GAI applications at the firm level and their potential for value co-creation and value co-destruction; (2) the REFLECT-based mechanisms through which such GAI applications can facilitate value co-creation and value co-destruction for industry stakeholders; and (3) the research questions that arise from the relationships in the REFLECT model.\n\n# GAI Applications at the Firm Level\n\n# Strategic Management\n\nGAI has the ability to profoundly influence strategic management within the HT industry. In this context, strategic management is defined as “the process through which firms define their missions, visions, goals, and objectives, as well as craft and execute strategies at various levels of the firms’ hierarchies to create and sustain a competitive advantage” (Okumus et al., 2019, p. 5). Leadership plays a critical role in navigating the transition to a GAI-integrated strategic management model, and the role of leaders will evolve with the advent of this new technology. This shift may require new\n\n# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\n\n# Leadership\n\nApproaches to leadership that focus more on collaboration, agility, ethical and responsible use of GAI, and emotional intelligence to foster human–machine collaboration (Heukamp, 2020; Peifer et al., 2022).\n\nOne of the most important aspects of leadership is innovation, and GAI is particularly well-suited to assist leaders in creating value for the stakeholders. By assisting with the process of idea generation and brainstorming, GAI can assist leaders in identifying avenues through which the company can innovate new products and services that bring additional value to the company stakeholders, drawing upon knowledge and information far beyond that which would be accessible to individuals. This means that innovative idea generation will now no longer be dependent on a single visionary CEO or a small, highly experienced product development team, who are inherently limited in idea creation by the boundaries of their own knowledge or experience. This is not without downsides, however. Just as GAI can help a particular firm create value in this way, it can, at the same time, be providing the same information to other competing firms, resulting in an increased threat of substitutes, new entrants to the space, and a much more competitive environment. Over time, this can result in value co-destruction for the focal firm in the form of lost competitive advantages and increased spending on competitive warfare.\n\n# Operations\n\nThere is no doubt that the advent of GAI is already impacting HT operations in a meaningful way and will continue to do so in ways we cannot yet imagine as the technology continues to develop.
