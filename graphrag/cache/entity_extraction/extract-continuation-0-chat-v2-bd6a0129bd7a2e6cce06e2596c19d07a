In this way, we verified that the studies related to OCS sought to investigate, in a general way, whether their development led companies to obtain benefits related to corporate sustainability.\n\nThe identification procedure was similar to that used for OCS, that is, some benefits were similar or related. Thus, such benefits have also been grouped into broader categories (Table 4). Each identified benefit was related to the article from which it was extracted. Finally, from these analyses, it was possible to develop an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, as well as provide an overview on research gaps and propose a research agenda on the topic.\n\n# 3. General overview on the literature on organization capabilities for sustainability\n\nFig. 3 presents the evolution of publications over the years. The first paper related to OCS was published in 1998 (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). It is a relevant research since several other authors of this sample cited it (it was the most cited - 786 citations, according to the WOS). This may be an indication that some authors have started researching on this topic from the perspective of Sharma and Vredenburg (1998).\n\nHowever, the studies are scarce in the following years, with an increase in 2008. The years 2015 to 2019 (the latter year encompasses only two months) indicate that studies on this topic has been intensified, demonstrating the relevance of this theme in the current context.\n\nThe articles were published in 45 different journals. Some of these journals have as their main scope topics related to environmental issues, while others have a more general and well-diversified scope, which indicates that different areas are linking their research to the OCS issues. The most significant journal in the sample is the Journal of Cleaner Production, with 16 articles. All journals that had more than two sample articles published have a relevant Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which demonstrates the importance of publications on the subject.\n\n# Fig. 3. Evolution of the number of articles over the years.\n\n| |20| |18| |16| |14| |14| |12| |10| |9|9| | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |8| |7| |6| |5|5|5|4| |4| |4| |2| | | | | | |\n|2|1|0|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|0| | | | |0| | | | | | | |\n| |1998|1999|2000|2001|2002|2003|2004|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|Feb-19|\n\nFig. 4 shows that the research methods favor practical and theoretical approaches. The survey is the most used method, and represents the only type of quantitative approach of the sample. The use of this method has increased over the years (highlighting 2017 and 2018, with the largest number of publications). Regarding theoretical articles, there is a\n\nsignificant number. This corroborates the fact that it is a subject of recent research and still demands exploitation of knowledge. Most theoretical articles deal with deepening of the study topics, relations between theories, among others. Among the articles with a theoretical approach, only Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019) conducted an SLR, and none aimed to develop an integrative framework that related strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, which confirms the importance of this study.\n\nHowever, there are only 13 among 88 articles using a qualitative approach (Fig. 4). Among case studies, 3 of them have a longitudinal approach. It is not explicit whether there is a tendency in using this method over time. However, from 2008, the case study has been used over the following years, which demonstrates the validity of this method within this research theme. Finally, only two papers adopted mixed methods.\n\n# Fig. 4.
