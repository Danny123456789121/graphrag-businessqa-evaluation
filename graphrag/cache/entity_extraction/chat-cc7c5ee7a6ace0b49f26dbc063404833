First, we are able to claim with more confidence than before that a highly significant, positive, and bidirectional CSP-CFP relation exists. The findings are robust at first-order and, in particular, at second-order meta-analytical level and do not change when we consider potential publication bias, apply less conservative variances, or conduct sensitivity analyses. True variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those at first-order level. Thus, the resulting credibility interval is much narrower, with a lower bound virtually at zero (m = 129). We are therefore safely able to claim that in 95% of cases we observe a positive average effect in meta-studies on the CSP-CFP relation. We find no indication that either CSP or CFP matters more from a cause–effect point of view. All three underlying theories (slack resources, good management, and virtuous circle) can empirically be defended. However, the level of effect sizes for a bidirectional relation is highest at the lowest variability of the effects. This leads us to acknowledge the virtuous circle theory as the most probable. To date, the academic CSP-CFP debate is often coined by the notions of ‘contradictory’, ‘mixed’, or ‘ambiguous’ findings. We propose that the business case for CSP can be considered well proved. Research designs taking into account non-linear CSP-CFP relations may even further increase the explanatory power of the CSP-CFP relation (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; Gao, Wu, & Hafsi, 2017; Trumpp & Guenther, 2017; Wagner, Van Phu, Azomahou, & Wehrmeyer, 2002).\n\nSecond, we shed light on an academically well-established misinterpretation. We cannot detect statistically significant differences between the effects of environmental and social-related CSP on CFP. This outcome is in contrast to several empirical studies and conceptions which consider social aspects as the main driver for CFP. Our findings propose a different result: good CSP pays off, whether social or environmental related. The difference between both is not statistically significant. This result mirrors S. L. Hart’s (1995) idea of a natural resource-based view and supports other empiric evidence for the business case of improving CEP (Albertini, 2013; Berchicci & King, 2007; Etzion, 2007). It may also be a way for revitalizing the resource-based view (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011) to acknowledge environmental- and social-related aspects as equally relevant sources for companies’ success.\n\nThird, within CSP dimensions, it is possible to identify different sources for a business case. The strongest relation to CFP is identified for CSP reputation. The intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate and potentially the most overarching outcome measure for CSP, leads to sustained superior financial profit (Melo & Garrido-Morgado, 2012; P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002; Sabate & Puente, 2003). On the other hand, the strong correlation for CSP philanthropy reiterates that instrumental and moral initiatives can supplement each other (Brammer & Millington, 2008; Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, 2016). CSP disclosure as well as CSP audits, processes, and policies are significantly weaker correlations compared to the rest of the CSP dimensions. The limited standardization of CSP disclosure practices (Busch, Bauer, & Orlitzky, 2016) seems, in fact, to encourage companies to provide primarily beneficial rather than unbiased CSP information (Schultze & Trommer, 2012; Ullmann, 1985). The significantly weaker correlation of CSP disclosure may point to reliability and validity issues of CSP data. One way of overcoming such data limitations can be to strengthen efforts toward a more stringent – and maybe even obligatory – extra-financial data disclosure. Standardization efforts of the Sustainable Accountings Standards Board (SASB, 2015) and the European Union (EU, 2014) are promising steps forward in this regard.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

This finding mirrors other researchers’ claims that operational performance such as productivity is located closer to the value creation source within a firm; it better reflects organizational performance than potentially distorted CFP categories like accounting- or market-based measures (McWilliams et al., 1999; Peloza, 2009; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986).\n\nFifth, it is an interesting phenomenon that correlations shrink for different CFP categories – perceptual performance having the highest correlation and CSP mutual funds the lowest. The closer research gets to realized market performance, the smaller the effects. Several reasons may explain why empirical studies on CSP mutual funds exhibit a relatively weak CSP-CFP relation. Realized performance in mutual funds depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, & Xu, 2001; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009), construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, & Thorley, 2002), and costs for portfolio implementation which can be as high as 2\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
