We report the corresponding tracking portfolio regressions in Panel A of Table 8. For robustness, we explore both sets of basis assets. From the chi-square test we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero at the 5% level, regardless of which set of basis assets we use, indicating that the (U.S.-specific) basis assets do not track global temperatures.\n\n# 6.5. SMB, HML, and the temperature shock factor\n\nAs small-big and value-growth stocks are differently affected by temperature shocks, it is possible that SMB and HML capture some of the information in the temperature shock factor. We explore this perspective by separately regressing SMB and HML on the temperature shock factor. The results are reported in Panel B of Table 8 for both sets of basis assets. As expected, SMB and HML capture some information in the temperature shock factor, since there are significant correlations between the temperature shock factor and SMB/HML. Thus, a part of the well-known explanatory power of the size factor (SMB) and the value factor (HML) for cross-sections of returns may arise from differing sensitivities of assets to the temperature factor.\n\n# 6.6. Temperature variability and exposure to temperature shocks\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nIf temperature shocks really matter in terms of their local effects (on, for instance, labor supply and productivity), we should expect that firms in areas with more temperature variation are more negatively affected by temperature shocks. To capture local temperature variation, we retrieve state-level temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center, and rank the U.S. states according to the standard deviation of the state-level temperature from 1953 to 2015. We define the 10 states with the highest standard deviation of temperatures as high-temperature-variation states (H), and the 10 states with the lowest standard deviation of temperatures as low-temperature-variation states (L). Since firms often have their production facilities close by their headquarters (Coval and Moskowitz, 1999), we identify the location of a firm by its headquarter location, and form size-value as well as industry portfolios within states. We then run time-series regressions to examine if firms in high-temperature-variation states are more negatively affected by the temperature shock factor relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in low-temperature-variation states.\n\nThe results are reported in Table 9. The “Industry portfolios” section presents the results for the five industry portfolios. In three of five industries, the loadings on the temperature shock factor are significantly more negative for firms in the high-temperature-variation states. For instance, for manufacturing firms, while the loading on the temperature shock factor is -5.14 (t = -2.68) for firms in the high-temperature-variation states, it is -0.00 (t = -0.00) for firms in the low-temperature-variation states. The results for Other are inconsistent with our expectation, which may be partially due to our identification strategy. For instance, Other includes Trans.\n\nAlthough coastal areas are typically vulnerable to climate change (Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe, 2014), many effects are not directly related to local temperatures. For instance, rising sea levels may be more due to global temperatures instead of local temperatures. The 10 high temperature-variation states in our sample are: Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; The 10 low temperature-variation states are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n(transportation). Although a transportation company’s headquarter may be located in a low-temperature-variation state, it may provide its services in high-temperature variation states too, making our results difficult to interpret. The results for the size-value portfolios are shown in the “Size-value portfolios” section, and suggest that temperature shocks in general have more negative impact on firms in high-temperature-variation states.\n\n# 6.7. Uncertainty about regulation\n\nOne potential explanation for the sensitivity of particular industries to the temperature shock factor is that the indicator has little intrinsic economic importance for temperature fluctuations but that markets fear the political pressures arising from common perceptions of a climate change threat that may lead to untoward regulation hurting business profits. This “untoward regulation” line of reasoning implies that those industries which are most vulnerable to regulation designed to reduce man-made climate change would be the most sensitive to the temperature change factor. A prospective regulatory impact generally entails rationing or taxation of carbon-dioxide emissions. Hence the prediction is that industries that are the most sensitive to the temperature change factor are those industries that have the highest share of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nSchipper (2006) provides data on carbon-dioxide emissions in U.S. manufacturing. Manufacturing accounts for around 84 percent of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions. The Petroleum, Chemicals, and Primary Metals industries have the highest carbon-dioxide emissions, together generating more than half of these emissions. However, it is apparent from Table 4 that Oil (Petroleum and Natural Gas), Chems (Chemicals), and Mines (Precious Metals, Non-Metallic, and Industrial Metal Mining) do not have particularly large negative sensitivities to the temperature shock factor. Furthermore, many of the industries in Table 4 with strong negative\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nExposures to the temperature shock factor are non-manufacturing industries such as Finance, Retail, and Meals, with obviously low carbon-dioxide emissions. These observations do not support the “untoward regulation” explanation.\n\nWe also carry out a more formal test.
