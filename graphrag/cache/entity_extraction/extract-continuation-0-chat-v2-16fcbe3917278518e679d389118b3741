In particular:\n\n1. The risk premium on the temperature shock factor may have declined because of reduced temperature risk. Indeed, as Panel E of Figure 2 shows, the standard deviation of temperature (30-year moving average of U.S. annual temperatures) displays a similar pattern as the time series of impact estimates in Panels A-D, and has started to decline after 2004.\n2. The ability of firms to handle temperature fluctuations has improved as trading in weather derivatives has taken off dramatically since the turn of the century and adaptation may have been substantial in recent years.\n3. It is naturally also possible that the time series after 2004 is too short to pick up a reliable trend, in contrast to our simple sample split, which did support Hypothesis 3 over the full data period.\n\n18\n\n# 6. Further discussion and robustness checks\n\n# 6.1. Industry portfolios as basis assets\n\nIn this paper, we follow Vassalou (2003) and use the six Fama-French size and book-to-market (BM) portfolios as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio. However, as Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) imply, because size and BM portfolios have a strong factor structure, a factor with spurious correlation with the size and book-to-market factors could seem to carry a significant risk premium in standard asset-pricing tests. Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) suggest taking into account industry portfolios. In our case, previous studies (e.g., Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014) also suggest that particular sectors (e.g., construction, transportation, and manufacturing) are more vulnerable to temperature shocks. However, we should not expect climate sensitivity to be homogenous within an industry, because as we have pointed out size and value also matter. For instance, although temperature shocks affect labor supply and productivity, a large manufacturing firm (or a firm with less capital in place), relative to a small firm (or a firm with more capital in place), may be better able to mitigate the effects of temperature shocks by, for instance, installing more effective/advanced cooling systems. Thus, it may be more informative to use industry-size-value sorted portfolios, instead of just industry portfolios, to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio.\n\nTo avoid employing too many basis assets we adopt the Fama-French five-industry classification.12 For each of the five industries we use only the small-firm portfolios (small firms are more sensitive to climate changes) and distinguish between low-value and high-value firms (firms with fewer assets in place adjust more easily than those with more assets in place). In all\n\n12 See http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. The industries are Cnsmr (Consumer Durables, NonDurables, Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services -- Laundries, Repair Shops), Manuf (Manufacturing, Energy, and Utilities), HiTec (Business Equipment, Telephone and Television Transmission), Hlth (Healthcare, Medical Equipment, and Drugs), and Other (Other, Mines, Constr, BldMt, Trans, Hotels, Bus Serv, Entertainment, Finance).\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nWe parsimoniously employ 10 industry-size-value portfolios (SL and SH in each industry) as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio, and report the results in Panel A of Table 6. Multicollinearity among even this diverse and relatively small group of 10 basis assets makes it difficult to interpret individual coefficients. However, the chi-square test cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficients on the basis assets are jointly zero, indicating that the basis assets jointly have significant tracking ability. Furthermore, the mean return of the tracking portfolio is -0.03 with a t-statistic of -4.27, which is close to that based on the primary specification (i.e., using six size and BM portfolios as basis assets).\n\nWe repeat the time-series as well as cross-sectional tests with the newly constructed temperature shock tracking portfolio (TSF10), and report the results in Panels B and C of Table 6. The time-series tests show that not only do many of the test assets have significant exposure to the temperature shock factor, but also their exposure is consistent with the predictions of the climate-economy literature. For instance, value (high-BM) portfolios are negatively affected by temperature shocks. The cross-sectional test reveals that the temperature shock factor carries a significantly negative premium even in the presence of the market factor.\n\n# 6.2. Bootstrapping simulation\n\nIn evaluating the significance of the risk premia in Panel C of Table 6 we consider errors-in-variables robust (Shanken, 1992) and misspecification-robust (Shanken and Zhou, 2007) standard errors.14 Jiang, Kan, and Zhan (2015) demonstrate that, even with these corrections, ignoring estimation error in factor mimicking portfolio weights can lead to an underestimation of...\n\nAs shown in the Web Appendix, employing only the five industry portfolios as the basis assets provides no significant tracking ability. In addition, we find considerable within-industry heterogeneity along the size and value dimensions. Nevertheless, holding size and BM constant, industry sensitivities differ substantially, indicating that temperature shocks are not merely relevant as spuriously related to size and BM.\n\nThe GMM-based standard errors employed in, among others, Vassalou (2003) and Aretz, Bartram, and Pope (2010) also adjust for errors in variables.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nThe standard errors of the estimated risk premia corresponding to these portfolios\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FAMA-FRENCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fama-French is a financial model used to analyze asset pricing and risk factors in various portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAFF ZIVIN<|>PERSON<|>Graff Zivin is a researcher who has studied the impact of climate change on economic factors, particularly in relation to temperature shocks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEIDELL<|>PERSON<|>Neidell is a researcher associated with studies on climate change and its economic implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEWELLEN<|>PERSON<|>Lewellen is a researcher who has contributed to the understanding of asset pricing and risk factors in finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAGEL<|>PERSON<|>Nagel is a researcher who has worked on financial models and asset pricing, particularly in relation to size and value factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANKEN<|>PERSON<|>Shanken is a researcher known for his work on asset pricing and econometric methods in finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK TRACKING PORTFOLIO<|>EVENT<|>The temperature shock tracking portfolio is a financial construct used to analyze the impact of temperature fluctuations on asset returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDUSTRY PORTFOLIOS<|>EVENT<|>Industry portfolios are collections of stocks grouped by industry, used to analyze performance and risk factors in finance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature and typical weather patterns in a place, impacting various sectors including finance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAFF ZIVIN<|>NEIDELL<|>Graff Zivin and Neidell are both researchers who have studied the economic impacts of climate change, particularly temperature shocks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEWELLEN<|>NAGEL<|>Lewellen and Nagel are both researchers who have contributed to the understanding of asset pricing and risk factors in finance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMA-FRENCH<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK TRACKING PORTFOLIO<|>The Fama-French model is used to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio, analyzing risk factors<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK TRACKING PORTFOLIO<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>The temperature shock tracking portfolio is designed to analyze the financial impacts of climate change<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDUSTRY PORTFOLIOS<|>TEMPERATURE SHOCK TRACKING PORTFOLIO<|>Industry portfolios are used as basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHANKEN<|>FAMA-FRENCH<|>Shanken has worked on econometric methods that are relevant to the Fama-French model in asset pricing<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
