Later, in the 1990s, sustainability reporting on occupational health and safety (OHS) was observed, and a paradigm shift to reporting on societal-based activities, accompanied by institutionalization.\n\nConsidering that each participant in society has its unique responsibility to engage sustainable development at a global scale, corporate sustainability reflects the organizationsâ€™ part to global challenges of sustainable development [12], including depletion of natural resources and social sustainability. There are several challenges regarding corporate sustainability, such as the need for considering both external and internal stakeholders in corporate decisions [13]; to resolve discrepancies, contradictions, and synergies among the three pillars of TBL sustainability [14]; to promote an approach to corporate sustainability based in moral-values [15]; to foster corporate social responsibility across the business life-cycle thinking [16]. Add to this, the several contributions available in the literature from different epistemological fields connected with environmental, economic, and social performance, and it seems evident that there is an absence of coordination among them. Diouf et al. [17] emphasized the growing significance of sustainability reporting and the use of international regulations, targets for reducing carbon emissions, and international standards and guidelines. Arribas et al. [18] investigated that the inclusion of irresponsible companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) from S&P Dow Jones Indices, and Social Accountability (SA8000) from Social Accountability Internationalâ€”SAI (2008) is a fact.\n\nThose who manage business decisions face multiple criteria for achieving the best practices while trying to achieve multiple goals. Decisions regarding sustainable business practices have multi-level characteristics as TBL dimensions can be broken down into hierarchical variables [19]. One primary objective of this study is to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria. Therefore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is recommended for simultaneously addressing decisions with multiple objectives and multiple criteria. Multi-criteria decision theory helps to orchestrate the various awareness of practices involving sustainability [20] and to help when making decisions regarding dynamic topics. Multi-stakeholder, multi-objective, and multi-level frameworks have been developed and utilized in the literature to assess corporate sustainability results but, so far,\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nthe initiatives have not provided a consistent, single measure capturing the TBLâ€™s complexities and integrating the MCDA. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to provide a methodology to help organize and understand this dynamic context for sustainable business practices.\n\nAdd to this dynamic context, a global pandemic and things can get interesting. Due to the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, the modern world is suffering a global economic crisis with well over 9 million cases, and over 501,000 fatalities as of September 2020 affecting more than 200 countries [21]. Many businesses have shut down, and the rate of unemployment has increased. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has become an unparalleled global crisis and is challenging organizations, which ultimately can have a negative effect on corporate sustainability and business practices [22]. Until now, corporations have not had to plan for a pandemic. Moreover, corporate sustainability has been marginalized due to organizations, governments, and society struggling to survive in times of a pandemic. Researchers have stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is opening new challenges for corporate sustainability, mainly because supply chains and their manufacturers are facing the pandemicâ€™s negative effects, such as market downturn, SMEs bankruptcy, employeesâ€™ resignations, revenue loss, to name a few. Therefore, we see the post-COVID-19 era as an opportunity by which organizations can rethink their sustainable business practices concerning a shift in their manufacturing, supply chain, and sustainability strategies. Here we find the third objective for this study to extend our understanding of corporate sustainability by also exploring the more recent impacts of the pandemic.\n\nResearchers, policymakers, and decision-makers are now more concerned about how to make corporations more sustainable. This study is an attempt to help decision-makers and researchers by developing a framework for corporations regarding social sustainability dimensions that include COVID-19 as a new attribute of sustainable business practices. Many aspects of corporate sustainability can be measured to calculate the companyâ€™s sustainability efficiency. In this study of corporate sustainability, we assess this paradigm using (i) Governance; (ii) Product Responsibility; (iii) Transparency and Communication; (iv) Economic; (v) Environmental; (vi) Social; (vii) Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability; (viii) Energy Consumption and Saving, and a new criterion, (ix) Pandemic COVID-19. These nine aspects are further divided into forty-five sub-criteria. In doing so, one contribution of this study is the addition of values for these major criteria and sub-criteria as we attempt to fill a gap in the corporate sustainability literature. As a partial response to the recent and growing call for understanding the pandemic COVID-19 effects on businesses, the authors conducted this research aiming to contribute to the growing literature on the topic by developing a multidimensional framework for corporate sustainability. Further, this study prioritizes the main and sub-attributes of an emerging sustainability model by being among the first to use MCDA techniques.\n\nTo help start us down a path to understanding this dynamic context for corporate sustainability, fundamental factors can be identified from the literature and further classified as a foundation for understanding corporate sustainability. In this study, we draw from the literature to develop lists of main and sub-attributes essential for developing corporate sustainability business practices. Building on our objectives for this study, our primary research questions include, but are not limited, to what are the most influenceable metrics for corporate sustainability? And how can they be evaluated and ranked in a way that provide value to practitioners and scholars? After reviewing the literature, conceptual models, our research framework, and applying a Fuzzy Delphi method, we assess nine sustainability criteria and forty-five sub-criteria. We review our methods for employing the F\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has caused significant economic and health crises worldwide, affecting over 9 million cases and resulting in over 501,000 fatalities as of September 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health, which has declared COVID-19 an unparalleled global crisis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dow Jones Sustainability Index is a stock market index that evaluates the sustainability performance of publicly traded companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY INTERNATIONAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Social Accountability International is an organization that promotes human rights and social responsibility in the workplace, known for the SA8000 standard.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis is a decision-making process that evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making, particularly useful in corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability refers to the management of a company's operations in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING<|>EVENT<|>Sustainability reporting is the practice of companies disclosing their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance to stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-STAKEHOLDER FRAMEWORK<|>EVENT<|>A multi-stakeholder framework is a collaborative approach that involves various stakeholders in decision-making processes, particularly in assessing corporate sustainability results.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TBL SUSTAINABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Triple Bottom Line (TBL) sustainability is a framework that considers three dimensions of performance: social, environmental, and economic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRIBAS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Arribas et al. are researchers who investigated the inclusion of irresponsible companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIOUF ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Diouf et al. are researchers who emphasized the growing significance of sustainability reporting and the use of international regulations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global crisis and is responsible for addressing its public health implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>The Dow Jones Sustainability Index evaluates corporate sustainability performance, influencing how companies manage their sustainability practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY INTERNATIONAL<|>Social Accountability International promotes corporate social responsibility, which is a key aspect of corporate sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Sustainability reporting is a critical component of corporate sustainability, providing transparency about a company's ESG performance<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis is recommended for addressing decisions related to corporate sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-STAKEHOLDER FRAMEWORK<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Multi-stakeholder frameworks are developed to assess corporate sustainability results, involving various stakeholders in the process<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TBL SUSTAINABILITY<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY<|>Triple Bottom Line sustainability is a foundational concept within corporate sustainability, addressing social, environmental, and economic dimensions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRIBAS ET AL.<|>DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX<|>Arribas et al. investigated the inclusion of companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, highlighting its relevance to corporate sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIOUF ET AL.<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING<|>Diouf et al. emphasized the importance of sustainability reporting in the context of corporate sustainability<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
