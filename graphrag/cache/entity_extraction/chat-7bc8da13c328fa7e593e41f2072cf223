Making this differentiation is important as aggregated firm performance in virtual portfolios and financial products such as mutual funds or indices may deviate from primary firm data. Several primary portfolio studies and corresponding reviews report an abnormally low level of positive findings. And vice versa, a high level of mixed findings, compared to nonportfolio studies (Bauer, Koedijk, and Otten 2005; Peloza 2009; Kleine, Krautbauer, and Weller 2013; Revelli and Viviani 2015). In order to differentiate between portfolio and nonportfolio effects, we deconstruct all distributions and summary effect sizes with sufficient sample size in both blocks of study groups.\n\nThe relevance of this distinction becomes apparent when looking at the vote-count studies. The share of positive results in the n = 155 identifiable portfolio-related studies shrinks.\n\n# Table 4. Effect size in dependence of aggregation approach and sample.\n\n|Number of review analyses|Effect size|Effect size value|Power α = 0.05|Fail-Safe N|CI L|CI U|CrI L|CrI U|N|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|35|rv|0.146***|0.999| | | | | | |\n|25|rm|0.118***|0.999| | | | | | |\n|-|i|0.119***|0.804|-|-|-|-|-|551|\n|-|p|0.169***|0.991|-|-|-|-|-|551|\n|25|ri|0.108***|0.997|0.0014|0.094|0.123|0.035|0.182|717|\n|25|-|0.150***|0.999|0.0022|0.132|0.169|0.058|0.242|987|\n\nThis table depicts first-order and second-order meta-analytical results. Attenuated correlations are marked as r and disattenuated correlations as p. The number of lines above letters indicates the first- or second-level nature of the effect size. The additional circumflex accent indicates psychometric meta-analytically effect sizes. Correlations not marked with a circumflex are meta-analytical averages but not determined with psychometric meta-analysis. rv is the sample-size weighted second-level effect size in vote-count analyses and rm the sample-size weighted second-level average effect size in meta-analyses. ri and p are the second-order meta-analytical attenuated and disattenuated averages. The deviation of all effect sizes from ri and p are the attenuated and disattenuated first-level effects sizes in transparent primary studies, and s2 is the estimated true variance for ri and p. Power 0.05 is Cohen’s power with α = 0.05 zero is tested for significance. For the second-order meta-analytical correlation means pi and ri CI L/CI U symbolize the 95% CI and CrI L/CrI U the 95% CrI. L indicates the lower and U the upper bound of the interval. Fail-Safe N is Rosenthal’s (1979, 1991) statistic to detect potential publication bias in meta-analyses. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level. A level above 5*n + 10 for Fail-Safe N is considered unlikely to assume publication bias within studies. This can be ruled out. The significance thresholds for p-values are ***p < .01.\n\n# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment\n\n# 221\n\n|60%|56.7%|\n|---|---|\n|50%|40%|\n|36.1%|37.4%|\n|30%|20%|\n|18.8%|18.7%|\n|15.5%|11.0%|\n|10%|5.8%|\n|0%| |\n\nDownloaded by [41.58.143.77] at 05:59 11 March 2016 positive negative neutral mixed\n\nPrimary studies (netted, binomial probability adjusted), non-portfolio studies, n=568\n\nPrimary studies (netted, binomial probability adjusted), portfolio-studies, n=155\n\n# Figure 4.\n\nESG–CFP relation in vote-count studies in dependence of portfolio- and nonportfolio sample.\n\nConsiderably (15.5%) in comparison to nonportfolio-based studies (56.7%). Studies with neutral or mixed findings increase proportionately in portfolio-based studies and constitute nearly three quarters. The share of negative studies increases marginally compared to nonportfolio studies (11.0% vs. 5.8%) (Figure 4).\n\nComparable results are found when all portfolio-focused vote-count studies are separately analyzed based on estimated effect sizes. The studies exhibit a negative correlation rv(p) = -0.061 in comparison to the 30 primarily nonportfolio-focused vote-count studies with rv(non-p) = 0.177. The difference between both groups is highly significant (Table 5). These conclusions are supported when the first-level meta-analytical results in the transparent primary studies are deconstructed. The differences in correlations are not so pronounced, nonetheless significant (Table 5). This distinct deviation of portfolio and nonportfolio findings is examined in more detail in the “Discussion” section.\n\n# Table 5.\n\nEffect size in dependence of portfolio and nonportfolio samples.\n\n|Number of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
