Additionally, the analysis shows areas in which the unexplained variance across studies remains relatively large, so that further inquiry is needed to identify moderators (for example, CSP reputation measures and market-based CFP; see Table 4a).\n\nMoreover, Appendix A shows that the field must make a concerted effort to improve the reliability of CSP and CFP measures. In several subgroups, the percentage of variance of r obs explained by measurement error (that is, low reliability) was substantial. In addition to psychometric refinements, CSP researchers must decide whether CSP ‘processes’ should really be regarded as a social performance measure. Including processes is equivalent to acknowledging effort. More broadly, some readers may share the authors’ concern that previous studies were over-inclusive with respect to definitions of stakeholders and, thus, the CSP proxies (cf. also Roman et al. 1999). We would argue that in future studies, only social and environmental performance ‘outcomes’ should count as CSP and that the concept of ‘stakeholder’ must be more restrictive than it currently is.\n\nAnother concern that may be raised concerns the different variable CSP measures. This issue needs to be examined in future theoretical and empirical work. We believe that CSP, like CFP, is a valid theoretical construct — admittedly a meta-construct — which can be measured in a variety of ways. Like Meyer and Gupta (1994), we see the possible independence of the operationalizations as a natural outcome of differences in organizational strategies, structures, and environments. Moreover, we share the view of many meta-analysts (for example, Cooper 1989; Dalton et al. 1999; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Smith and Glass 1977) that broad constructs can, and should, be operationalized in a number of ways. As long as researchers’ choices of CSP (and CFP) measures are informed by prior judgments of their theoretical meaningfulness and subjected to peer review, then relatively low correlations across measurement categories do not present an obstacle to research integration. More important to the present case, however, is that our review of CSP generalizability coefficients shows that different CSP measures are, in fact, rather highly correlated (average rxx = .71; Appendix A). In other words, conceptual speculations about the impossibility of meaningful integration of prior research are not supported by empirical evidence (for a detailed review of this topic, cf. Orlitzky 1998).\n\nOverall, we reach very different conclusions than Margolis and Walsh (2001). Although we agree with some of their more definitive conclusions as to a positive CSP–CFP relationship, we also argue that our data analysis.\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n# 24(3)\n\nshows that interesting questions remain. The research effort does not have to be abandoned because of poor theory or poor methods in this line of inquiry. We are particularly concerned with the conclusions of Margolis and Walsh (2001) because their criticism of other studies is argued from the vantage point of a method (the ‘vote-counting’ literature review) whose lack of validity has been known for more than 20 years (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). First, they do not take into account sampling and measurement errors. Moreover, their review relies on a binary world-view, which holds that a relationship between CSP and CFP either exists (if results are statistically positive, or negative) or does not exist (if results are mixed or statistically non-significant, which they falsely call ‘zero’ effects (cf. Cohen 1990, 1994)). The relationship between business and society is too important theoretically to base our conclusions on methodologically ill-advised research reviews.\n\n# Implications for Managers\n\nDespite previous assumptions of inconclusive findings (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995), we can legitimately derive implications for corporate strategy from the meta-analysis. First and foremost, market forces generally do not penalize companies that are high in corporate social performance; thus, managers can afford to be socially responsible. If managers believe that CSP is an antecedent of CFP, they may eventually actively pursue CSP because they think the market will reward them for doing so. Top managers must learn to use CSP as a reputational lever (ρ= .73) and be attentive to the perceptions of third parties, regardless of whether they are market analysts, public interest groups, or the media. Whereas social audits in and of themselves are only moderately beneficial (ρ = .23), a company that is high in CSP may especially benefit from receiving public endorsement from federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As Fombrun (1996) suggested, the key to reaping benefits from CSP is a return from reputation (cf. also Roberts and Dowling 2002).\n\nAs findings about the positive relationships between CSP and CFP become more widely known, managers may be more likely to pursue CSP as part of their strategy for attaining high CFP. These strategic management considerations would be consistent with Baron’s (2000) managerial approach to the business–society interface. Baron (2000) argues that successful executives are able to integrate market strategies with non-market strategies in order to position their firm for optimal effectiveness. Baron’s (2000) book offers guidelines as to how firms can strategically\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARGOLIS AND WALSH<|>PERSON<|>Margolis and Walsh are researchers who have drawn conclusions about the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Environmental Protection Agency is a federal agency that endorses companies with high corporate social performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is a federal agency that endorses companies with high corporate social performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Performance (CSP) refers to a company's commitment to social responsibility and ethical practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) refers to the financial outcomes and profitability of a company.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOMBRUN<|>PERSON<|>Fombrun is a researcher who suggested that the key to reaping benefits from corporate social performance is a return from reputation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>Baron is a researcher who discusses the integration of market and non-market strategies for optimal effectiveness in corporate management.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGOLIS AND WALSH<|>CSP<|>Margolis and Walsh have drawn conclusions regarding the relationship between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGOLIS AND WALSH<|>CFP<|>Margolis and Walsh have drawn conclusions regarding the relationship between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY<|>CSP<|>The Environmental Protection Agency endorses companies that demonstrate high corporate social performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION<|>CSP<|>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration endorses companies that demonstrate high corporate social performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>CFP<|>There is a positive relationship between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance, as suggested by various researchers.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOMBRUN<|>CSP<|>Fombrun suggested that a return from reputation is key to benefiting from corporate social performance.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>CSP<|>Baron discusses the integration of market strategies with corporate social performance for optimal effectiveness.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>CFP<|>Baron discusses the integration of market strategies with corporate financial performance for optimal effectiveness.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
