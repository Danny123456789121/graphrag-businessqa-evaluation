Nevertheless, by focusing on the major factors involved, relatively robust sustainability principles can still be defined (Robèrt, 2000). Using the principles as defined in the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015) provides a solid, stable and comprehensive basis for assessing whether corporations create societal values or not. Additionally, these sustainability principles can be used as guides to define sustainability criteria (Hallstedt, 2015).\n\n# Proposition 1b:\n\nIn order to measure the societal value of corporate sustainability management, the operationalization of sustainable development needs to be testable. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers this kind of operationalization.\n\n11\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Example 1b: Companies that are aware of their sustainability activities\n\nmeasure them by using criteria and key performance indicators linked to the FSSD principles.\n\nThe sustainability performance of a company is based on the environmental, economic and social impacts of the resources used by the company, the products and services provided and the emissions, waste and by-products generated. The overall impact of these effects on society, however, also depends on the prevailing perceptions of the external stakeholders and the prevailing socio-cultural and economic conditions. The relationship between the company’s performance and its impacts is referred to as the sustainability impact chain (see Figure 2). The existing level of welfare in a region will have an influence the acceptance level of the environmental or social impacts. For example, in times of economic crisis, the relevance of environmental protection might decline as compared to that of job opportunities.\n\n# External stakeholders\n\nCompany (internal stakeholder)\n\nCulture\n\nStrategy\n\n# Sustainability performance\n\nActions\n\n# Society\n\n# Nature\n\nFigure 2: Sustainability impact chain (based on Laudal, 2011)\n\nThe environmental impacts on nature are not dependent on socio-cultural or economic conditions, since they are based on physical and chemical processes. However, the relevance of the extent of a given impact on nature with respect to societal and organizational decision processes depends on both the prevailing socio-cultural and economic conditions and the relevance of these impacts as perceived by the stakeholders. Within society, those negatively affected can articulate their problems themselves. Nature and the biosphere do not have this option. Therefore, they need some form of ‘translator’, or voice in society.\n\n12\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Proposition 1c\n\nThe sustainability performance of an organization is based on corporate activities. The extent to which the related impacts on society and nature are considered relevant and tolerable is additionally influenced by socio-cultural and economic conditions.\n\n# Example 1c\n\nThis proposition addresses the public perception of the relevance of sustainability issues and the perceptions of members of the management team. For instance, climate change is usually more often interpreted as a severe threat to society and nature than the loss of biodiversity due to corporate activities. When assessing a company’s sustainability performance, the socio-cultural and economic conditions should be taken into account. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers principles that can be used for such an assessment.\n\nThe environmental and social performance of existing structures, systems and processes can be increased without altering the existing structures. In this case, the efficiency of the system (i.e., its probability of functioning correctly) is increased; this type of performance is defined as first-order sustainability performance. In many cases, however, increasing efficiency alone might not be sufficient and existing structures and systems must be challenged to increase environmental and social performance (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002). The need for a second-order level of sustainability performance exists, which allows the systemic effects to be taken into account and integrates the idea of effectiveness (i.e., that the correct things are being done) into the analysis. Drawing a distinction between the first- and second-order sustainability performances highlights the difference between attempting to make short-term improvements in efficiency and creating a more systematic form of innovation with sustainable development in mind. Second-order sustainability performance helps both the organization and society, in general, to become more sustainable.\n\n# Proposition 1d\n\nWhile assessing the impact of business activities, one needs to take both first- and second-order levels of sustainability into account. First-order levels are related to narrow issues of efficiency, while second-order levels are broader, and more closely related to systemic effectiveness.\n\n# Example 1d\n\nIncreasing the efficiency of existing processes and products, such as raising the fuel efficiency of gasoline-fueled cars or improving the efficiency of recycling processes are examples of first-order sustainability performance. Second-order sustainability performance involves the introduction of new technologies, products and services such as new closed-loop electronic waste management with a focus on reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing.\n\nThese four propositions describe concepts of the societal value of corporate sustainability management, which is based on the integration of robust sustainability principles into the strategy content.\n\n# 3.2 The business value of sustainable strategic management – adding the context dimension\n\nCompanies that want to achieve higher levels of sustainability emphasize the potential extra value that can be created for the business by choosing this path; the impact of their choice on society and the natural environment tend to be secondary considerations. Corporate goals must be more carefully examined, before a discussion of the business value of corporate sustainability management can be made. The analysis of corporate goals is a central topic in management research (Macharzina and Wolf, 2008). From the viewpoint of sustainability, the question arises as to what extent environmental and social goals are considered by companies, and how sustainability-related goals and other corporate goals are related. The relationships between environmental and/or social goals and economic goals can be complementary, competitive, or irrelevant (Wöhe and Döring, 2008). In the case of complementary relationships, fulfilling one type of goal helps achieve other types of goals; where relationships are competitive, pursuing one type of goal can have a negative influence on the attainment of other types of goals; and where relationships are irrelevant, no mutual influences\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
