We obtain data on female representation from Risk Metrics. Our main variable of interest, Target, equals 1 if the firm receives a gender diversity-related shareholder proposal in year t, and 0 otherwise. Firm Size is measured as the log of total assets; Profitability is defined as the return-on-assets, and is measured as income before extraordinary items divided by total assets. Board size is the total number of board members. CEO Duality is an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO also serves as the chair of the board, and zero otherwise. CEO on the Nominating Committee is an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO serves on the nominating committee, and zero otherwise. We measure female board representation (Female Representation) as the percentage of females on the board. The independence of the board of directors (Board Independence) is measured as the percentage of board members who are classified as independent. We include 1-digit SIC code dummy variables for industry membership and also dummy variables to control for the year. Board characteristics are obtained from RiskMetrics and financial data are obtained from Compustat.\n\n†, *, **, *** indicate significance levels of the difference at the 0.10, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001 levels, respectively, using two-tailed tests.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
