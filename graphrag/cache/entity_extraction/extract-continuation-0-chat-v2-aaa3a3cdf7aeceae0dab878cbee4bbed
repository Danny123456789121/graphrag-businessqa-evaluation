Thus, in order to capture the attention of the online target audience, personalization of product and service offerings on online platforms has become the norm of the industry.\n\nGenerative AI can assist with the hyper-personalization of the content by triangulating the prospective customer’s browsing history and past purchases with other available digital footprints. These dynamic real-time offers can result in a higher conversion of promotion offers and a lower click-through ratio. For example, users are sent customized advertisements and offers based on the view, like, comment, and other engagement parameters in real-time. In the hospitality sector, generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT-enabled plugins provide a customized itinerary to tourists based on their profile, query, current location, and preferences. This can lead to better customer experience (CX), more conversions, and improved profitability.\n\n# Pricing\n\nGenerative AI also allows firms to differentiate their service offerings and charge a premium for such services. Generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT can provide prompt responses to queries on a real-time basis and are available round the clock. Many firms have designed their own generative AI systems which are more efficient and accurate in their query results as they use the company’s past project databases on top of the open-source databases. Hence, companies can charge premium pricing for generative AI-enabled service interface platforms as compared to service offerings without these interface facilities.\n\n# Sales optimization\n\nGenerative AI provides opportunities to optimize sales results and improve CX by providing various process facilitation. Generative AI provides scalability of personalization in terms of customized offers with name, pricing, packaging, and other specific customer requirements for millions of customers. Generative AI provides great transparency and complete visibility to the customer’s digital journey. It can aid in funnel management in domains like e-commerce, banking, and hospitality by identifying the critical delay points or customer dropping-off stages (where customers drop out and do not go to the next stage of purchasing cycle) on a real-time basis. Generative AI can also help in leveraging the power of experimentation by looking at different predictive analytics situations.\n\n# Attribution\n\nThe attribution puzzle for online campaigns has remained unsolved to date with various models providing different results. The accuracy of attribution is crucial as the advertising budget portfolio is reallocated accordingly at the end of the campaign. Generative AI serves as a silver lining to this confusion as it can help solve this puzzle to get a converging result. Generative AI can process complex data faster and process more digital touchpoints that the customer had visited before making the purchase. It could also account for the duration and relative influence of the visited website. This would provide better attribution results as all customer touchpoints are included in the analysis.\n\n# Remarketing\n\nMany companies are not able to extensively analyze their existing data for customer insights. Generative AI would empower the sales and marketing team to leverage these vast data sets of existing customers to get insights and recommendations. It lets the company send them new product information and relevant promotional offers. Consumer insights also help marketing executives to segment the target population. Some of these recommendations may be discarded by company executives and are not feasible to be implemented. Remarketing products and services using these insights to customers or clients who had visited the website but did not buy anything would lead to a higher chance of conversion. A generative AI-based remarketing strategy will aid in reaching out to specific customers seamlessly in a personalized manner.\n\n# Challenges\n\nDespite several advantages, there are practical challenges when executing generative AI tool-driven projects in companies. The significant challenges are enumerated below:\n\n# Data ownership\n\nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT provide responses that are grounded on back-end databases. However, integrated generative AI requires data that are publicly available and privately held. Privately held data includes information on customers who had previously interacted with the company or system, the company’s completed and ongoing projects, and third-party data from external parties who have previously worked with the organization.\n\n# Research agenda\n\nThere are multiple advantages of using generative AI in the marketing domain. However, there are certain gray areas and challenges which would require further exploration.\n\n# Privacy\n\nThe collection and use of back-end data as input in generative AI should be fully compliant with the law of the land. Some examples include the General Data Protection Rules in Europe, California Consumer Privacy Act in the USA, and Data Protection Act 2018 in the United Kingdom. The output of generative AI tools like Bard or ChatGPT may include personal data, thus infringing upon privacy, and may fall in the ambit of violation of informed consent. Such privacy violations include exposing the financial status of customers, revealing details of a yet-to-be-launched brand/company, unauthorized collection/sharing of private information, and online movement tracking through the app without user consent.\n\n# Ethical dimensions\n\nThere have been cases of search bias concerning generative AI tools. Such incidents can impact the brand reputation and profitability of the company in the long run. The growing use of generative AI in sales and marketing activities may lure a few companies to use biased data with flawed narratives as input. Marketers would need to be self-regulated against these traps and keep a watch on generative AI-based results until robust international regulations are in place. Another generative AI-related ethical dimension regarding customer data acquisition and collection via cookies is “how far and deep” can the company mine personal data. There are already discussions among large corporations to remove third-party cookies. With that said, the larger question remains as to how generative AI tool-driven targeted advertising would be ethically sustained.\n\n# Empathy and emotion in service delivery\n\nGenerative AI is helping to engage customers in an immersive manner, leading to increased sales. The use of generative AI in the service sector was an issue of debate, with specific jobs being taken away\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate content and assist in hyper-personalization of services and products based on user data and preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bard is a generative AI tool that provides customized itineraries and responses to user queries in real-time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a generative AI tool that offers prompt responses to queries and assists in various service interfaces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSPITALITY SECTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The hospitality sector utilizes generative AI tools to enhance customer experience through personalized services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE (CX)<|>EVENT<|>Customer Experience (CX) refers to the overall experience a customer has with a company, which can be improved through generative AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018<|>EVENT<|>The Data Protection Act 2018 is a law in the United Kingdom that governs the collection and use of personal data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT<|>EVENT<|>The California Consumer Privacy Act is a law in the USA that enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERAL DATA PROTECTION RULES<|>EVENT<|>The General Data Protection Rules are regulations in Europe that protect personal data and privacy of individuals.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARD<|>HOSPITALITY SECTOR<|>Bard is used in the hospitality sector to provide customized itineraries to tourists based on their preferences<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>HOSPITALITY SECTOR<|>ChatGPT is utilized in the hospitality sector to enhance customer interactions and provide real-time responses<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE (CX)<|>Generative AI improves Customer Experience (CX) by personalizing services and offers based on user data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>HOSPITALITY SECTOR<|>Generative AI tools are implemented in the hospitality sector to enhance service delivery and customer engagement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>BARD<|>Bard is a specific application of generative AI that provides personalized responses and itineraries<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>CHATGPT<|>ChatGPT is a specific application of generative AI that assists in real-time customer queries<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The Data Protection Act 2018 governs the use of personal data in generative AI applications<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The California Consumer Privacy Act impacts how generative AI tools handle consumer data<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERAL DATA PROTECTION RULES<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The General Data Protection Rules influence the compliance of generative AI systems with data privacy regulations<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
