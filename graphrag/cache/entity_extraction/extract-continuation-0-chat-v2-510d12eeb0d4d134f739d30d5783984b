Integrative framework relating strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits\n\nThe present Section provides a qualitative and deep analysis of the paper’s sample. Content analysis techniques were conducted from which OCSs were identified (Section 4.2), as well as their relations to corporate sustainability (Section 4.2).\n\n# 4.1. Organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCS)\n\nAs described in section 2, the OCSs were grouped into categories. These categories allow synthesizing the literature that addresses this research topic, thus helping in the understanding and operationalization of the constructs. Seven OCSs categories were created: capabilities related to collaborative relationships for sustainability (OCS1), capabilities related to the absorption of knowledge/learning about sustainability (OCS2), capabilities related to innovation/technology for sustainability (OCS3), capabilities related to alignment/motivation for sustainability (OCS4), capabilities related to marketing/external communication for sustainability (OCS5), capabilities related to flexibility/adaptation on sustainable issues (OCS6), and capabilities related to the management of sustainable operations (OCS7).\n\nTable 2 presents the OCS categories, followed by a general definition assigned to each one. Since the similar and related capabilities that compose each category received different nomenclatures, the column 3 of Table 2 presents the terms of capabilities that comprise each category. Finally, column 4 presents the respective references that applied those terms.\n\n|OCS categories|Definition|Related terms|References|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Capabilities related to collaborative relationships for sustainability (OCS1)|Ability to collaborate with other companies and other stakeholders to jointly address sustainability challenges.|Ability to cooperate;
