As in Shi (2003), in the energy use equation (Eq. (1)), T is proxied with two variables: the share of the industry (IND) and service sectors (SV) in GDP. In addition to these two variables, energy intensity is included in the CO2 emission equation (Eq. (2)). Note that the energy intensity variable cannot be included in Eq. (1) because it is measured by total energy use divided by GDP, containing part of the dependent variable.\n\n# P. Poumanyvong, S.

(1) and (2), respectively. Y is a year dummy that captures the time-speciﬁc effect. This can capture the effects of changes in global energy prices and technological progress not proxied by T. It also helps remove possible cross-sectional dependence in the equations (Petersen, 2009). C is a country dummy used to capture the unobserved country-speciﬁc effect, namely geographic location and resource endowment, as these possibly affect energy consumption and emissions. Adding country and time dummies is a standard treatment for panel data analysis, helping minimize heterogeneity bias and problems with possible spurious regression (Wooldridge, 2007). Therefore, the previously discussed equations are robust against omitted variables, generating reliable estimates.\n\nThis paper estimates the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions using a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries covering the period from 1975 to 2005, yielding 3069 observations. The sample is considerably larger in terms of countries and years when compared with many previous studies. To fully address the concern whether urbanization pressure on energy use and emissions differs across the different levels of income and to empirically test the arguments of the ecological modernization and urban environmental transition theories, we divide our estimation into two parts. First, we estimate the whole sample without consideration of different income levels. Second, we estimate the sample divided into three income groups, low-, middle- and high-income groups, based on country classifications in 2004 (World Bank, 2009). The low-income group consists of 23 countries, while the middle- and high-income groups consist of 43 and 33 countries, respectively (see Table A.1 in Appendix A).\n\nThe data on population, urbanization, GDP, the share of the industry and service sectors in GDP are mainly from the World Bank (2007). The GDP information was missing for some countries, but we filled it in with the data from IEA (2009b,c). The data on industry and services were also missing for a number of countries. Fortunately, we found the missing information in the United Nations online database (UN, 2009). The data on CO2 emissions and energy use are derived from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2009a,b,c). The energy intensity and carbon intensity information is calculated using data from the World Bank (2007) and IEA (2009a,b,c).
