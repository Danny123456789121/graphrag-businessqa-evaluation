This process should be built on the creative skills of the different actors in the different stages of the solution seeking process, thus promoting the analysis of how different choices may impact organizational sustainability.\n\nThe model developed in this research can be used in a non-linear implementation process, because its different parts and stages may be individually implemented to identify and analyse specific issues, either in a preanalysis stage or in the development of action plans.\n\nA key factor in the ISI framework is its ability to foster the exchange of collaborative ideas between different stakeholders, enhancing change processes and innovative approaches in the development of products, services and solutions oriented towards sustainability business models.\n\nThe research presented in this paper has the inherent limitation of theoretical explorative studies — it is not supported on empirical evidence, and the interpretation of information is influenced by the authors' perspective. Therefore, empirical research regarding the operationalization of the ISI framework in real-case scenarios is essential to validate this theoretical model. As future works, an empirical research is being developed with the aim to identify internal, external and transversal key factors that will contribute to success in the different stages of the ISI framework and to analyse its impacts in different scenarios. It is our expectation that this new approach regarding decision-making oriented to CS may enhance future research works aiming the continuous refinement of the proposed model and its validation through empirical research.\n\n# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research work was supported by national funds provided by FCT – Fundaçao para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, in the scope of FCT Project PEST-BASE/03127/2020 and FCT Project UID/Multi/04546/2019.
