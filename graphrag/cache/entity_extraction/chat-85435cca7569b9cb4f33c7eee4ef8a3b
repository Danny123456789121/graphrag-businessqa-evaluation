We consider the various institutional sectors at the global level, as well as European SIFIs in particular. The aim of a climate stress test is to measure the exposure of investors to climate risk, in a scenario where more stringent sustainability-oriented policies are progressively implemented, with increasing pressure on comparatively more carbon-intensive firms and sectors. In such a scenario, the expected returns on greener stocks increase, as more sustainable firms are able to distribute higher dividends, while the price of brown stocks drops for the same reason. Notably, one of the first areas where policy pressure may increase, and is in fact already increasing in Europe, is that of environmental disclosures. Against this background, firms that have already implemented suitable non-financial accounting procedures and adopted more advanced environmental reporting standards will be better off once the non-financial disclosure regulation becomes more stringent. In other words, the expected return on stocks of more environmentally sustainable and transparent firms conditional to the implementation of sustainability policies increases. Formally, this implies that the return on the greenness and transparency factor in Equation (7), which is positively correlated with returns on greener and more transparent stocks, increases.\n\nWe test the resilience of investors to climate risk by borrowing data on equity exposures and the classification of economic sectors into climate-policy-relevant sectors from Battiston et al. (2017). Following the indication provided by the authors as supplementary information in Table 3, we group individual stocks (see Section 5) according to their associated NACE code. In particular, we classify stocks in the following economic sectors: fossil fuels, energy intensive activities, housing, utilities, transport, finance and other. Table 1 in Battiston et al. (2017) provides aggregate holdings into climate-policy-relevant sectors, as of 2015, for the following institutional sectors: Individuals, Governments (GOV), Non-Financial Companies (NFCs), Other Credit Institutions (OCIs), Other Financial Services (OFSs), as well as the institutional financial sectors as defined in the ESA classification, i.e. Banks, Investment Funds (IFs), and Insurance and Pension Funds (IPFs). Battiston et al. (2017) also classify equity holdings of individual financial institutions by climate-policy-relevant sectors, obtaining the share of their portfolio invested into each of these sectors. Based on their data, we focus on European SIFIs, as identified by the Financial Stability Board.\n\nThe equity portfolio of an investor j at time t is defined as follows:\n\nrj,t = ∑ωκrκ,t,7\n\nwhere ωκ corresponds to the equity exposure to the climate-policy-relevant sector κ and rκ,t is the monthly average value weighted portfolio return of sector κ.\n\nFor each institutional sector and individual bank j, we compute the marginal expected shortfall (MES) introduced by Acharya et al. (2010). The MES is defined as the expected equity loss conditional on a particular factor.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nreturn taking a loss greater than Γ. In this application we estimate the expected equity loss conditional on the greenness and transparency factor return defined in Equation (7) realizing a gain greater than Γ, i.e. a scenario where greener and more transparent stocks outperform brown stocks by more than a particular threshold. Hence, we can write the MES as follows:\n\nM ESj,t = −\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
