For example, domestic Kenyan organizations’ CSR approach is different from foreign organizations due to the different institutional environments of global and domestic markets (Muthuri & Gilbert, 2011). Therefore, we consider the contingent roles of economic development (developed vs. developing) to set conditions on the value of CSR practice. Second, at the meso-level, industry setting is important because not all CSR activities are equally beneficial to all industries (Scott, 1995). For instance, manufacturing industries have a stronger negative effect on the environment, so they may attract more attention from stakeholders than firms from service industries (Reverte, 2009). Firms that sell products to customers directly are more likely to engage in corporate philanthropy as a strategy, while firms targeting customers consider the ethics of CSR (Tang & Li, 2009). In a sample of US companies, firms in heavy industries (e.g., mining, raw materials, and chemicals) were more likely to focus on the natural environment and employee conditions, while firms in light industries (e.g., retail) tended to focus on corporate philanthropy (O’Connor & Shumate, 2010). As a result, manufacturing and service industries have heterogeneous values regarding CSR. Third, at the micro-level, we consider firm size because it can influence CSR actions (Lepoutre & Heene, 2006) and moderate the relationship between CSR and competitiveness (Marín et al., 2012). For example, SMEs and non-SMEs may differ in CSR visibility and decision making preferences (Brammer & Millington, 2005). Recent studies also found that firm size can influence CSR.\n\nM. Hou et al.\n\nactions (Lepoutre & Heene, 2006) and moderate the relationship between CSR and competitiveness (Marín et al., 2012). Fourth, organizational form may influence the CSR–performance relationship. Specifically, public firms, whose shares are traded on a stock exchange, often receive higher levels of media and public attention forcing them to engage in CSR activities. In contrast, private firms receiving less press and public attention are more flexible and may derive different benefits from CSR.\n\n# Economic development: Developed and developing countries\n\nEast Asian countries are at various economic development stages. Their cultural backgrounds, institutional settings, and CSR activities vary because of distinct institutional environments and different coercive or cognitive pressures to engage in CSR (Baughn et al., 2007; Maignan & Ralston, 2002). We follow Reed’s (2002) classification and divide Asian national economic development into developing and developed categories. Developed East Asian economies, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, are characterized by stable demand, intense competition, short channels, and sophisticated buyers (Ellis, 2006). Their various stakeholders, such as the state, professions, publics, and interest groups, exert pressures and expect CSR (Baughn et al., 2007). While, developing regions, such as People’s Republic of China, are characterized by weak legal system, poor law enforcement, pervasive corruption, and other institution deficiency phenomenon (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1998).\n\nAs outlined above, CSR practices can transfer green and good signals to customers, suppliers, government, and other relevant stakeholders for the estimation of organization’s attitude towards environmental and social issues. If a firm is known to have better CSR than their competitors, key stakeholders will perceive the CSR activity as a signal of good reputation (Su & He, 2010) differentiating the firm from competitors. We argue that the strength of these signals may vary in different East Asian regions with different institutional backgrounds (King et al., 2005; Montiel et al., 2012). That is, in developing regions, CSR practices signals play a more important role in improving business performance.\n\nIn Japan, South Korea, and other East Asian developed regions, it is much easier for stakeholders to get relevant CSR information about the firm (e.g., CSR disclosure report, corporate philanthropy). Those firms with poor corporate social performance will always be punished by government, customers, and industry associations (Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009). Stakeholders in advanced economies also have the capacity to access large amounts of non-CSR information to judge firm’s CSR practices (Andrade & Chhaochharia, 2010). Furthermore, media exposure, disclosure reports, and other forms of information transformation facilitate the investment decisions more quickly by investors. In general, according to the information, stakeholders can evaluate firm’s CSR practices more conveniently and accurately. Therefore, the signaling role of CSR practices as a tool for solving information asymmetry becomes diluted in a situational environment with large amounts of information. Conversely, developing East Asian economies, such as China, are pursuing rapid economic development but have weak social institutions and high uncertainty (Reed, 2002) and often lag behind in many CSR aspects (Welford, 2004). Because firms in China and other East Asian emerging economics are not used to disclosing CSR related information, stakeholders are difficult to access the valuable information concerning firms’ CSR attitude. Thus, the signaling role of CSR in these regions is more valuable for stakeholders in assessing.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\nThe organization’s potential value (Montiel et al., 2012). In addition, in emerging economies, the institutional environment often changes dramatically when local governments introduce various new laws and regulations (Chung & Beamish, 2005; Dileleman & Sachs, 2008). By building strong connections with governmental stakeholders, firms in transitional environments can use CSR to compensate for their shortcomings.\n\nGenerally, in East Asian developing regions where CSR is less\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KENYA<|>GEO<|>Kenya is a country in East Africa known for its distinct institutional environment affecting CSR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a developing country characterized by a weak legal system and pervasive corruption, impacting its CSR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is a developed East Asian economy with stable demand and sophisticated buyers, influencing its CSR activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>South Korea is a developed East Asian economy known for intense competition and stakeholder pressures regarding CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIWAN<|>GEO<|>Taiwan is a developed East Asian economy characterized by a stable market and expectations for CSR from various stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a developed East Asian economy with a unique institutional environment that influences CSR practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by organizations to have a positive impact on society and the environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>M.
