However, one particular issue concerning the relationship between CSR and the financial performance of firms has generated enormous interest amongst academics, policy makers and practitioners (Ullmann, 1985; Marom, 2006). The issue is that businesses and practitioners would like to see a business case to justify their commitment to CSR. Numerous empirical studies aimed at finding a possible answer to the question have produced mixed results (Peloza and Papania, 2008), most of which are neither straightforward nor conclusive (Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Marom, 2006). In the theoretical vein, two contrasting models have been suggested. One is rooted in the positive impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on corporate financial performance (CFP).\n\nwhile the other is based on the assumption that increased costs resulting from CSP put participant businesses in a disadvantageous position as compared to those that do not support CSR. While differing methodologies and statistical techniques have been held responsible for the lack of a consistent pattern of outcomes, an alternative approach to resolve this impasse has not been suggested in the literature. Although a few meta analyses have partially contributed to possible solutions to the issue, these results have not ultimately revealed any conclusive evidence either (e.g. Orlitzky and Benjamin, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003, Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Frooman, 1997; Wood and Jones, 1995). This apparent lacuna in the literature has prompted our meta analysis to uncover some possible sources of variation in the outcomes of 51 of the studies that Orlitzky et al. (2003) used in their meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis re-examines some of the issues that Orlitzky et al. (2003) did not speciﬁcally look at in detail. Some factors were considered and discarded for this study. For example, industry (see Cowen et al., 1987) was discarded because insufﬁcient detail is provided in the table showing effect sizes in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) paper. Firm size (see Orlitzky, 2001) was also discarded because individual data was not available for all the ﬁrms in the studies included in Orlitzky’s (2001) paper. Finally, country (see Quazi and O’Brien, 2000) was discarded because most studies in Orlitzky et al. (2003) were US-based. Size of sample used, statistical techniques employed and the timing of publications of the papers are all available for consideration as factors. The above three propositions were arrived at based on the available characteristics of the literature, particularly those included in Ortlitzky et al. CFP. We wish to derive a statistical measure of whether there has been any movement towards a consensus over time. Sample size is a key determinant of precision, and while Orlitzky et al. (2003) provide sample sizes, the authors carry out no further analysis of them. Researchers have used a variety of statistical techniques in their research and we wish to determine whether the choice of technique has an impact on the strength of the relationship. Time is used to subdivide studies by Grifﬁn and Mahon (1997). Sample size is provided by Orlitzky et al. (2003). Firm size is also suggested as a possible confounding variable by Orlitzky (2001). In a similar way, we examine the magnitude of the effect of sample size on effect size. Since sample size is an element of the formula for effect size, we know a priori that sample size inﬂuences affect size. Our analysis helps us to determine what the magnitude of the effect is.\n\nTo our knowledge, the effect of statistical methodology has not been studied previously. Our concern is that a restricted number of statistical techniques have been used to study the relationship between CSR and CFP and that this narrow focus on correlation, t-tests and regression may not model the complete relationship. It is to be noted that this paper includes those previous studies that looked at the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms in speciﬁc terms and this principle has been followed throughout the analysis process of our meta-research.\n\n# 2. Literature review\n\nThe question of whether there is any relationship between CSR and CFP has led to lively debate amongst academics and researchers since the 1960s (Cochran and Wood, 1984). Does social responsibility pay off? Can a ﬁrm that exercises social responsibility make higher proﬁts than one that does not? Are socially responsible ﬁrms good investment risks? These are some of the typical questions raised in the literature and addressed in several studies; these have expressed contrasting views based on research ﬁndings about the possible relationship between a ﬁrm’s social responsibility and its ﬁnancial performance. For example, McGuire et al. (1988) reported three different views on this point, which can be reclassiﬁed into two meaningful models presented earlier in this paper. The ﬁrst is that ﬁrms “face a trade-off between social responsibility and ﬁnancial performance”. This view is based on the argument that socially responsible ﬁrms are economically in a more disadvantageous position than those who are less responsible as a result of the cost incurred by the former for their socially responsible actions (Preston and O’Bannon, 1997; Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullmann, 1985; Vance, 1975; Preston and O’Bannon, 1997).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RUGIMBANA ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Rugimbana et al. is a reference to a group of authors who have contributed to the literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its relationship with competitive advantage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTER AND KRAMMER<|>PERSON<|>Porter and Krammer are referenced as authors who have discussed the relationship between CSR and competitive advantage in their work.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ULLMANN<|>PERSON<|>Ullmann is an author cited for their contributions to the understanding of CSR and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAROM<|>PERSON<|>Marom is an author referenced in the context of CSR and its financial implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PELOZA AND PAPANIA<|>PERSON<|>Peloza and Papania are authors who conducted empirical studies on the relationship between CSR and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRIFFIN AND MAHON<|>PERSON<|>Griffin and Mahon are authors who have contributed to the debate on CSR and its impact on financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky et al. are authors who conducted a meta-analysis on the relationship between CSR and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COWEN ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Cowen et al. are referenced for their work related to industry effects on CSR and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUAZI AND O’BRIEN<|>PERSON<|>Quazi and O’Brien are authors cited for their contributions to the understanding of CSR in different countries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate social performance (CSP) refers to the performance of a company in relation to its social responsibilities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate financial performance (CFP) refers to the financial outcomes of a company's operations and its profitability.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUGIMBANA ET AL.<|>PORTER AND KRAMMER<|>Rugimbana et al. reference Porter and Krammer's work on CSR and competitive advantage<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ULLMANN<|>MAROM<|>Ullmann's work is referenced alongside Marom's contributions to CSR and financial performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PELOZA AND PAPANIA<|>ULLMANN<|>Peloza and Papania's empirical studies are related to Ullmann's work on CSR and financial performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRIFFIN AND MAHON<|>ULLMANN<|>Griffin and Mahon's contributions to the debate on CSR are linked to Ullmann's findings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PELOZA AND PAPANIA<|>Orlitzky et al.'s meta-analysis includes studies conducted by Peloza and Papania<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COWEN ET AL.<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>Cowen et al.'s work on industry effects is referenced in Orlitzky et al.'s meta-analysis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUAZI AND O’BRIEN<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>Quazi and O’Brien's contributions to CSR are mentioned in the context of Orlitzky et al.'s findings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>CFP<|>CSP is discussed in relation to its impact on CFP in the literature<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
