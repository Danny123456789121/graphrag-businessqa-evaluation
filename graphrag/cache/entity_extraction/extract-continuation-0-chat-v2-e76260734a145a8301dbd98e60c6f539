One central issue concerns the causal effects between the two constructs. Because existing primary literature is characterized by its heterogeneous study designs and mixed empirical evidence, the aim of this paper is to explicitly shed light on the causality effects between CEP and CFP by means of a meta‐analysis of 893 empirical estimates from 142 CEP–CFP studies. Our findings suggest that in the short run (1 year), financial resources can increase a firm's environmental performance as proposed by the slack resources hypothesis; however, the effects disappear in the long run (after more than 1 year). Conversely, increasing environmental performance has no short‐term effect on a corporate financial performance, whereas a firm significantly benefits in the long term, which is in accordance with the Porter hypothesis. Overall, our results show that the causality between environmental performance and financial performance depends on the time horizon.\n\n# KEY WORDS\n\ncausality, corporate environmental performance, corporate financial performance, environmental policy, meta‐analysis, sustainable development\n\n# 1 | INTRODUCTION\n\nOver the past decades, empirical literature studying the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and financial performance (CFP) has grown rapidly. As a consequence, controversies arose concerning the sign of the relation, moderating and mediating factors, and the causality of the effect (Feng et al., 2018; Hartmann & Vachon, 2018). Due to these aspects, academics often refer to this bivariate relation as an overall heterogeneous and complex interaction (Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Guenther & Hoppe, 2014). Although literature provides a vast number of comprehensive and meaningful primary studies (among others, Hart & Ahuja, 1996; King & Lenox, 2002; Konar & Cohen, 2001; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Tang, Walsh, Lerner, Fitza, & Li, 2018) and meta‐analyses (among others, Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Guenther, Hoppe, & Endrikat, 2012; Hang, Geyer‐Klingeberg, Rathgeber, & Stöckl, 2018), the discussion of the causality is largely fragmented. Besides the prevalent mixed empirical evidence, existing primary studies are strongly characterized by their heterogeneous study designs, which hampers comparison. Overall, the questions whether CEP affects CFP, CFP affects CEP, or if there even exists a bidirectional relation are still unresolved, also the signs of the respective effects are ambiguous.\n\nThe most common approach of addressing this issue in a primary study is the application of the Granger causality specification (Angrist & Pischke, 2009). Therein, CEP and CFP are analyzed in a regression framework, whereas the two constructs of interest are measured at different time lags. The results for the causal effects are then revealed by exchanging the dependent and independent variable or varying the time lag between them. Although delayed effects are not identical to causality, they are at least accepted as a strong indicator (e.g., Bono & McNamara, 2011; Mitchell & James, 2001; Wagner & Blom, 2011).\n\nBus Strat Env. 2018;1–17. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/bse © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\nMost of the existing studies focus on a single causality between CEP and CFP. The majority of articles analyzes the causality from CEP to CFP, as for example, the studies by Hart and Ahuja (1996), Hillman and Keim (2001), King and Lenox (2002), Konar and Cohen (2001), and Russo and Fouts (1997). In contrast, a smaller part of the literature investigates the causality from CFP to CEP. This includes, for example, the studies from Arora and Cason (1995), Berrone and Gomez‐Mejia (2009), Cohen, Fenn, and Naimon (1995), Levy (1995), and Makni, Francoeur, and Bellavance (2009). As the concentration on a single direction of causality does not allow general conclusions, several primary studies contrast the two causal directions. Ameer and Othman (2012) and Makni et al. (2009) confirm a negative influence of CEP on CFP after 1 year. Horváthová (2012) extends this result by finding that CEP leads to a CFP decrease after 1 year, but firms profit from CEP\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARKUS HANG<|>PERSON<|>Markus Hang is a researcher involved in the study of the relationship between corporate environmental performance and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEROME GEYER-KLINGEBERG<|>PERSON<|>Jerome Geyer-Klingeberg is a co-author of the research article analyzing the causality between environmental performance and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREAS W.
