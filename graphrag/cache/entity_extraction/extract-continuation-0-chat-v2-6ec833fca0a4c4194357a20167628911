However, prior empirical studies provide indefinite conclusions. The purpose of this study is to review systematically and quantify the CSR–CFP link in a meta-analytic framework. Based on 119 effect sizes from 42 studies, this study estimates that the overall effect size of the CSR–CFP relationship is positive and significant, thus endorsing the argument that CSR does enhance financial performance. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the causal relationship between CSR and CFP. Subsequent financial performance is associated with prior social responsibility, while the reverse direction is not supported. This finding supports the instrumental stakeholder theory. As predicted, the meta-analysis results indicate that the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP explain some variations of the CSR–CFP relationship. Last, this study examines the moderating effect of the environmental context on the CSR–CFP link.\n\n# Corresponding Author:\n\nJunsheng Dou, School of Management, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou 310058, China.\n\nEmail: jsdou@zju.edu.cn\n\n# Business & Society\n\nwork proposes that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The results show that the CSR–CFP relationship is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.\n\n# Keywords\n\ncorporate social responsibility, financial performance, meta-analysis\n\n# Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\n\nhas been a subject of great interest for more than 30 years among scholars from multiple management perspectives, including cost perspective, agency theory, instrumental stakeholder theory, resource-based view (RBV), and reputation theory (Friedman, 1970; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; Muller & Kraussl, 2011). The existing empirical literature has largely focused on the precise nature of the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP; Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003; Ullmann, 1985). Since Bragdon and Marlin (1972) and Moskowitz (1972) published the first studies (Margolis & Walsh, 2003), more than 100 studies have empirically examined the relationship between CSR and CFP. However, the inconsistent findings for the linkage between CSR and CFP are still far from clear (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Ullmann, 1985; Waddock & Graves, 1997). Some studies suggest that being socially responsible does increase a firm’s performance (Lev, Petrovits, & Radhakrishnan, 2010; Surroca, Tribo, & Waddock, 2010); other studies suggest that it does not (Aupperle et al., 1985; Graves & Waddock, 2000). Moreover, recent empirical studies have explored nonlinear relationships and have argued that CSR cannot universally produce favorable returns for all firms all the time (Brammer & Millington, 2008; H. Wang, Choi, & Li, 2008).\n\nResearchers have identified a number of reasons for the failure to reach a consensus on the implications of improved social performance for financial performance. At the theoretical level, there is concern about stakeholder mismatching (Wood & Jones, 1995), theoretical shortcomings and inadequate definitions of key terms (Ullmann, 1985), “the conceptual determinants of CSR, and consequently the theoretical expectations of the CSR-CFP relationships” (Brammer & Millington, 2008, p. 1326), and the boundaries of CSR (Barnett, 2007). At the same time, a variety of operational shortcomings are also attributed to the mixed findings, such as operationalization and methodological differences in the definitions of social and financial performance.\n\nWang et al. - 3\n\n(Griffin & Mahon, 1997): failure to control some other important variables that have been thought to have direct influence on firm performance, such as risk, industry affiliation, asset, age (Cochran & Wood, 1984), investment in research and development (R&D), and advertising expenditure (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).\n\nTo figure out this inconsistent relationship, some scholars have used the method of meta-analysis to investigate the CSR–CFP linkage (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Although these previous meta-analyses on CSR–CFP linkage have examined a variety of theoretical and methodology shortcomings mentioned above, to date there has been little meta-analysis focus on the moderating effects of contextual factors that can explain the heterogeneity of the CSR–CFP linkage. Given that the empirical research on CSR has provided evidence suggesting that contingency factors, such as the level of dynamism in firms’ operational environment and industrial characteristics, may be the important factors in understanding the inconclusive results (H. Wang et al., 2008), it is surprising that the extant meta-analyses on CSR have not examined the moderating effects of the contextual contingency on the relationship between CSR and CFP. The present study seeks to fill this void in the CSR literature.\n\nMoreover, dramatic changes have occurred in the global economy over the past several decades.
