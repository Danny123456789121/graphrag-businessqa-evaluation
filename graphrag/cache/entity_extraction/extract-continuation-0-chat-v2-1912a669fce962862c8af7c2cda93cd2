The higher the level of sustainability awareness within an organization, the more ambitious the goals and strategies deployed when pursuing sustainable development.\n\n# Example 3a\n\nBaumgartner (2009) provides the example of a global mining company in order to illustrate the relationships between basic values, assumptions and strategic orientation.\n\nLong-term goals and product/service-market combinations are defined at the strategic management level. From a sustainability perspective, it is important that the business and societal values of corporate sustainability management are clearly identified and developed (see section 3.1 and 3.2; again, the FSSD with its backcasting approach and sustainability principles is very helpful). This requires the identification of specific contextual factors and evaluation of the relevance of sustainability issues for the company:\n\n# Proposition 3b\n\nDefining short-term and long-term goals in corporate sustainability management requires the clarification of the societal and business values that will be derived.\n\n# Example 3b\n\nA short-term goal could be the reduction of energy consumption per employee per year. A corresponding long-term goal might be the constant reduction in energy consumption together with the exclusive use of renewable energies in energy production.\n\n18\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nImplementing a corporate sustainability strategy at the operational level requires the integration of non-economic issues of sustainability. Matters that are not normally considered to be part of the remit of standard business administration must be addressed. The need to rely on and enhance employee capabilities is a key point. Specific feedback and learning loops must be established across different management levels. Most importantly, it must be possible to transfer the experience gained at the operational level to the strategic and normative levels, or experience gained at the strategic level to the normative level (Baumgartner, 2014). Furthermore, all organizational departments need to be involved in sustainability implementation, at least to some extent. To summarize these issues, the following proposition has been developed:\n\n# Proposition 3c\n\nA corporate sustainability strategy matches its goals with its organizational capabilities, the organizational responsibilities of different departments and the geographical and temporal system boundaries.\n\n# Example 3c\n\nTo define and implement a corporate sustainability strategy, it is necessary to identify the capabilities needed within the organization (e.g., the respective competencies in LCA or materials technology), and the departments involved in corporate sustainability activities (e.g., marketing, engineering, R&D). Additionally, decisions must be made in terms of time, location and operational technique.\n\nImplementing corporate sustainability management requires change and learning processes in any organization. Usually, three different levels of organizational learning may be distinguished: adoption-learning (single-loop-learning), change-learning (double-loop-learning) and learning to learn (deuteron learning) (Argyris and Schön, 1978). From a sustainability point of view, the organizational learning processes raise a number of interesting questions, such as those that address the extent to which it is possible to communicate and understand the long-term aspects of sustainability, or those concerning the nature and extent of the uncertainty associated with long-term development and interactions among environmental, social and economic issues from local, regional and global perspectives (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2009; Probst and Büchel, 1994; Müller-Christ, 2001). According to Siebenhüner and Arnold (2007), sustainability-oriented values must be integrated into an organization before any sustainability-oriented learning processes can take place. It is essential, therefore, to gain sufficient qualifications and receive enough training support.\n\nChange processes are doomed to failure unless the members of an organization possess the sufficient ability to learn (Bieker, 2005). The newer the strategy, structure and processes are to a company, the less compatible they are with the prevailing organizational culture, and the more intensive the organizational change and learning processes needed (Schein, 1995). This consideration led to the development of the following proposition:\n\n# 19\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Proposition 3d\n\nCorporate sustainability management should facilitate mutual learning processes to address challenges related to sustainable development. These learning processes are based on feedback loops in and among all organizational departments and management levels.\n\n# Example 3d\n\nGoal-oriented learning mechanisms, the integration of milestones into existing R&D processes, formalized instruments of communication, self-organized working groups, guideline-oriented learning processes and project work for learning processes all illustrate how learning may be embedded in the context of corporate sustainable development (Siebenhüner and Arnold, 2007).\n\nThe objective of operational management is to execute strategic guidelines and plans and attain the set strategic goals in the most efficient way. The corporate sustainability strategy is implemented at the operational level of management, in terms of how the vision, mission, long-term goals and strategic plans are executed within the company. The focus is placed on the various corporate functions such as on logistics and materials management, production, maintenance, marketing, public relations, human resources and communication. Innovation and continuous improvement are seen as cross-functional areas, which are integrated into other corporate functions. Specific sustainability-oriented activities must be carried out as part of each corporate function. The specific activities required depend on the type of strategy involved. Thus, the following proposition is suggested with respect to the operational level:\n\n# Proposition 3e\n\nDeveloping a sustainable organization requires the integration of issues of sustainability into the operational management level and the consideration of their relevance for all activities, routines and processes.\n\n# Example 3e\n\nSustainability needs to be operationalized for all activities, processes and routines, for instance, with the implementation of ISO 14001 with regard to environmental issues. Additionally, various aspects of sustainability need to be specified and should appear in all relevant organizational and decision processes (e.g., in descriptions of functional specifications, criteria for the selection of suppliers, eco\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BAUMGARTNER<|>PERSON<|>Baumgartner is an author who discusses the relationships between values, assumptions, and strategic orientation in organizations, particularly in the context of sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability management involves integrating sustainability into business practices and decision-making processes to achieve long-term goals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 14001<|>EVENT<|>ISO 14001 is an international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system, aimed at improving environmental performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sustainable organization is one that integrates sustainability into its operations and culture, aiming for long-term viability and minimal environmental impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGYRIS AND SCHÖN<|>PERSON<|>Argyris and Schön are theorists known for their work on organizational learning and change processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIEKER<|>PERSON<|>Bieker is an author who discusses the importance of learning abilities in the context of organizational change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEIN<|>PERSON<|>Schein is a scholar who has contributed to the understanding of organizational culture and change.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAUMGARTNER<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Baumgartner provides insights into how corporate sustainability management is influenced by organizational culture and strategic orientation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability management is essential for developing a sustainable organization by aligning goals with capabilities and responsibilities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGYRIS AND SCHÖN<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Argyris and Schön's theories on organizational learning are relevant to the implementation of corporate sustainability management.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIEKER<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Bieker emphasizes the need for learning abilities in organizations to successfully implement sustainability strategies.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHEIN<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Schein's work on organizational culture highlights the challenges faced in implementing corporate sustainability management due to existing cultural norms.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISO 14001<|>SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATION<|>ISO 14001 provides a framework for organizations to improve their environmental performance, which is a key aspect of becoming a sustainable organization.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
