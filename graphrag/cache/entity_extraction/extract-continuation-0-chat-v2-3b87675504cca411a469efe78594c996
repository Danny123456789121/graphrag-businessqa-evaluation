The first, and for this study most important, distinction of the study results was made regarding the time lag that was used for the measurement of CP and CFP variables. Time lags can be used to imply causal relationships between two variables. To take implemented time lags into consideration, CFP indicators are categorized as being measured prior, concurrently, or subsequently to the CP indicator (Bausch and Pils 2009). Furthermore, according to the employed statistical method, an effect size was captured as describing either a bivariate or a partial relationship.\n\nThe CFP indicator was represented by accounting (e.g. ROA) or market-based measures (e.g. stock return). Hybrid measures such as Tobin’s Q or earnings per share (EPS) were assigned to both groups for the subgroup analysis of the CFP indicator. In all other cases, they entered the analysis only as one effect size. The CP indicator was assessed by a donation dummy, the total amount of donation, or relative donations (e.g. percentage of pre-tax earnings). Furthermore, the inclusion of only cash, in-kind, or volunteered time donations into the CP measure, as well as the time horizon of the donation (i.e., continuous or disaster relief donations), were coded. The country of origin and observation year of the sample data was also captured. Additionally, the partial relationship effect sizes were coded for the moderating control variables they had included in the analysis. For a more detailed overview of coding categories and codes, supplementary material from the authors is available upon request.\n\nTo integrate the empirical results of the relevant studies, all reported effect sizes were transformed to r product momentum correlation coefficients using the respective transformation formulas (Greene 2000; Lipsey and Wilson 2001; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001). Whenever several observations were made within one study, we had to decide whether the measured effect sizes could be treated as independent from each other. While treated as independent, each effect size could enter the meta-analysis individually without introducing a significant bias to the results (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). In case effect sizes from one study could not be considered as independent, e.g. when observing the same sample and variables with different regression models, they had to be integrated into a single value or only one of the dependent effect sizes had to be chosen to be entered into the meta-analysis (Geyskens et al. 2009). Following the recommendations and examples of other meta-analyses in the field of management, effect sizes from one study were treated as independent as long as they clearly used different samples, different time lags, or different operationalization for the CP or CFP variable (Bijmolt and Pieters 2001; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Dalton and Dalton 2005; Carney et al. 2011).\n\nHowever, when a study reported the results of several regression models with changing moderating variables but identical samples, only the effect size from the model\n\nF. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nwith the highest R2 was used. When a study used summarizing variables, for example, by computing the factor of other variables (Balabanis et al. 1998), these values were not considered in this meta-analysis, but only the individual variables they were derived from. When a cumulated abnormal stock market return was measured over several days separately for the same sample, only the cumulated value of the last day was included into the analysis as it is suggested that the positive effect is stronger over longer terms (Diltz 1995; Gao et al. 2012).\n\nTo consider measurement error, the reliability of the dependent and independent variable was defined to be 0.8, as recommended by Dalton and Dalton (2005), and the correlations were adjusted accordingly (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). The corrected correlations r were integrated using Hedges and Olkin’s (1985) approach of converting correlations to Fisher’s z and weighting them by their inversed variance. Confidence intervals were constructed at the 90% level and significance p was reported at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels. Homogeneity was tested by calculating Q-statistics, and Q-between (QB) was used to assess if the heterogeneity between subgroups is explained by the regarding study design factor, in which case a significant p-value is reported for QB (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Calculated mean effect sizes rm are all based on the random effects model (Lipsey and Wilson 2001). Following the recommendation of Dalton and Dalton (2005), subgroup analysis was only performed with a minimum of three effect sizes.\n\nWhen conducting meta-analyses, publication bias, also referred to as the file drawer problem, is a severe issue which should not be neglected (Geyskens et al. 2009). While journals tend to focus on articles with significant research results to support or reject certain hypotheses, file drawers might be full with null results which never get published (Rosenthal 1979).\n\nTo account for possibly unpublished studies which might have altered the results, the fail-safe k was calculated based on Rosenthal’s (1979) file drawer method. The fail-safe k indicates the number of studies with a mean effect size of zero that would have been necessary to yield an insignificant (p = 0.05) summary effect. All the computations for integrating effect sizes, identifying confidence intervals, and calculating heterogeneity indicators\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BAUSCH AND PILS<|>PERSON<|>Bausch and Pils are researchers who contributed to the theoretical background of the study regarding CP and CFP variables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRENE<|>PERSON<|>Greene is an author referenced for transformation formulas related to effect sizes in the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIPSEY AND WILSON<|>PERSON<|>Lipsey and Wilson are authors referenced for their work on effect size transformations in the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROSENTHAL AND DIMATTEO<|>PERSON<|>Rosenthal and DiMatteo are authors referenced for their contributions to effect size transformations in the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DALTON AND DALTON<|>PERSON<|>Dalton and Dalton are researchers whose recommendations on reliability and meta-analysis are cited in the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEDGES AND OLKIN<|>PERSON<|>Hedges and Olkin are authors referenced for their approach to integrating effect sizes in meta-analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GYESKENS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Geyskens et al. are researchers referenced for their work on publication bias in meta-analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DILTZ<|>PERSON<|>Diltz is an author referenced for insights on the effects of stock market returns over time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAO ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Gao et al. are researchers referenced for their contributions to understanding stock market returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALABANIS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Balabanis et al. are authors referenced for their work on summarizing variables in meta-analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIJMOLT AND PIETERS<|>PERSON<|>Bijmolt and Pieters are researchers whose work is referenced regarding meta-analysis in management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOMOGENEITY TESTING<|>EVENT<|>Homogeneity testing is a statistical method used to assess the consistency of effect sizes across studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine results from multiple studies to derive conclusions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAUSCH AND PILS<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Bausch and Pils contributed to the theoretical background that informs the meta-analysis conducted in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRENE<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Greene's transformation formulas are utilized in the meta-analysis to integrate effect sizes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIPSEY AND WILSON<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Lipsey and Wilson's work on effect size transformations is applied in the meta-analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROSENTHAL AND DIMATTEO<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Rosenthal and DiMatteo's contributions to effect size transformations are relevant to the meta-analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DALTON AND DALTON<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Dalton and Dalton's recommendations on reliability are considered in the meta-analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEDGES AND OLKIN<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Hedges and Olkin's approach to integrating effect sizes is a key method used in the meta-analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GYESKENS ET AL.<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Geyskens et al.'s work on publication bias is a critical consideration in the meta-analysis<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DILTZ<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Diltz's insights on stock market returns are relevant to the analysis of effect sizes in the meta-analysis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAO ET AL.<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Gao et al.'s contributions to understanding stock market returns inform the meta-analysis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BALABANIS ET AL.<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Balabanis et al.'s work on summarizing variables is relevant to the meta-analysis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIJMOLT AND PIETERS<|>META-ANALYSIS<|>Bijmolt and Pieters' research on meta-analysis in management is foundational to the study<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
