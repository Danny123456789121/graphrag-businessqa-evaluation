The t-test for the other three indicators shows no significant results. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of labour practice and decent work is 3.98 (out of 5), which is very close to the test value of 4.\n\n# 4.4.2 Social indicators – human rights\n\nTable VI presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of human rights, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. Nine out of the ten human rights indicators are found to be statistically significant at either the 0.05 or 0.01 level. However, the mean values show that some indicators are considered more important, while the others are considered less important. With regards to indicators that were perceived as more important than what were intended by GRI, “child labour” and “security practice” obtained higher mean values than the t-test value of 4. In contrast, “non-discrimination”, “freedom of association and collective bargaining”, “indigenous rights”, “investment”, “human rights grievance mechanisms”, “assessment” and “supplier human rights assessment” are perceived as less important by the CSD report users in China than they were intended to be by GRI. The t-test for “forced or compulsory labour” shows no significant result. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of human rights is 3.89 (out of 5), which is quite close to the test value of 4.\n\n# 4.4.3 Social indicators – society\n\nTable VII presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of society, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “Compliance” is found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level and it has a mean value of 4.16, indicating that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. In contrast, “anti-competitive behaviour”, “public policy”, “local community” and “supplier assessment for impacts on society” are found to be statistically significant at either 0.01 or 0.1 level, but their mean values are less than the t-test value, meaning that they are considered less important. The t-test for the other two indicators shows no significant results. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of society is 3.91 (out of 5), which is quite close to the test value of 4.\n\n# 4.4.4 Social indicators – product responsibility\n\nTable VIII presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of product responsibility, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest.
