Proposals may be withdrawn for two primary reasons: they may be omitted or withdrawn. Omitted proposals result when the SEC grants exclusion of the proposal because of ineligibility (typically if the proposal is vague, false or misleading, the proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations, the proposal...\n\nis contrary to applicable law, a duplicate proposal exists, or on procedural grounds such as the defects in the shareholder’s proof of ownership. A proposal is withdrawn by the submitting shareholder when the firm and submitting shareholder have reached some form of agreement prior to the proposal going to vote (Carleton et al., 1998). Because withdrawn proposals often result in concessions by companies to activists, we include them in our analysis. In addition, Ferri (2012) encourages including withdrawn proposals in activism research, as excluding them potentially understates the success of activism efforts. However, in Table 2 we analyze voting patterns for the 64 proposals that went to vote to assess investor views for the different types of proposals and proponents.\n\n------------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------------\n\nFor our target analysis, we lose 16 proposals because board gender data is not available from RiskMetrics for the year prior to the target. We also lose 26 proposals due to missing Compustat data or where a match could not be found. The resulting sample for our target analysis is 140 proposals. In Panel B of Table 1, we identify five activist groups among the 182 proposals submitted: public pension funds (14), institutional investors (60), individuals (14), religious organizations (90) and other (4). The public pension funds include Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds and California State Teacher’s Retirement; institutional investors include Calvert Asset Management and Citizen Funds; religious organizations include the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) and the Episcopal Church; and individuals include Thomas Gniewek, Jr. and Charles and Lois Edwards.\n\n|Activist|Type|\n|---|---|\n|Public Pension Funds|14|\n|Institutional Investors|60|\n|Individuals|14|\n|Religious Organizations|90|\n|Other|4|\n\nTo consider how incentives might differ across activists, we categorize our proponents into two categories following Tkac (2006), and confirm this characterization by\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nour own examination of the stated objectives of different activist groups, where available. We define financially-motivated activists as those whose primary goal is to pursue financial returns, and include public pension funds and institutional investors in this category. Socially responsible mutual funds, such as Calvert, also fall in this category. While these funds screen investments according to ethical guidelines, their primary goal is still financial performance (Tkac 2006). In our (target analysis) sample, 78 (68) proposals are from financially-motivated proponents.\n\nWe categorize individuals and religious organizations as socially-motivated activists. Individuals are more likely to pursue shareholder activism that stems from personal preferences, while religious organizations tend to focus on issues of social and economic justice and utilize their investments and other resources “to change unjust or harmful corporate policies, working for peace, economic justice and stewardship of the Earth” (Tkac, 2006, p. 6). Louche, Arenas, & van Cranenburgh (2012) report that religious organizations are highly driven by the impact they can have on company behavior and society and therefore do not limit the purpose of investing to financial returns. In our (target analysis) sample, 104 (72) are from socially-motivated proponents.\n\nWhile our classification is inherently subjective, we consider two alternative ways to validate our approach. First we consider whether share ownership varies across activist groups. Activists with significant share holdings are more likely to place primary emphasis on financial performance of the firm. In our sample, activists only occasionally disclose within the proposal how many shares they own, and we compute mean holdings where at least five activists of a given group provide the disclosure. The average number of shares held by public pension funds is 380,230; the average number of shares held by investment funds is 12,185; virtually no individuals or religious organizations in our sample disclosed their share holdings. However, Zhou (2013) finds that individual activists hold significantly fewer shares.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nthan institutions, including investments funds and public pension plans. These findings suggest that we can assume that at least the public pension funds and institutional investors have more at stake financially and are therefore more likely to be driven by financial concerns.\n\nSecond, we observe how the arguments made by activists in their proposals vary by activist type to provide evidence of construct validity (see below). Our characterization is supported if the arguments made by each activist type align with our characterization of those types, and if the arguments also differ statistically across activist types.\n\n# Shareholder/Sentiment - Voting Patterns\n\nIn Table 2, we report voting patterns for the 64 proposals that went to vote by proposal type and proponent identity. The mean shareholder vote for the proposal is 17.4 percent, with votes for any given proposal ranging from 2.3 percent to 47.5 percent. It is notable that not one proposal in our sample received a majority vote. We also report voting patterns over three separate time periods: prior to Sarbanes-Oxley (Pre-SOX), 1997-2001; following SOX (Post-SOX), 2002-2008; and following Regulation S-K (Post-Disclose), 2009-2011. SOX required increased independence of boards, which potentially created new opportunities for women to serve on boards. In 2009, the SEC introduced Regulation S-K, which enhanced proxy statement disclosures, including those pertaining to board diversity.
