This theory suggests that firms view their stakeholders as part of an environment that must be managed to assure revenues, profits, and, ultimately, returns to shareholders (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999). Attention to stakeholder concerns may help a firm avoid decisions that might prompt stakeholders to undercut or thwart its objectives. This possibility arises because it is the stakeholders who control resources that can facilitate or enhance the implementation of corporate decisions (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). It has been demonstrated that employees show greater commitment to a firm that has a good public image in supplying human capital (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994). Moreover, such firms are often perceived as an attractive employer by job seekers (Backhaus, Stone, & Heiner, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000). Customers may respond to positive social performance by increasing their demand for the firm’s products or services, or by paying premium prices (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2003). Furthermore, some investors, particularly certain institutional ones, are more willing to invest in firms known for pursuing CSR (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Graves & Waddock, 1994; Johnson & Greening, 1999).\n\nOthers have augmented stakeholder theory with aspects of RBV (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). Drawing upon the RBV, researchers claim that by developing close relationships with primary stakeholders, a firm can develop certain intangible resources such as innovation (Klassen & Whybark, 1999), human resources (Russo & Harrison, 2005), and organizational culture (Howard-Grenville, Hoffman, & Wirtenberg, 2003), which enable the most efficient and competitive.\n\n# Business & Society\n\nuse of the firm’s assets and help it acquire a competitive advantage over its rivals (Surroca et al., 2010). CSR can function as a means for firms to secure the acquisition of critical resources controlled by stakeholders (H. Wang et al., 2008) and help firms to reduce the risk of losing resources they already control (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Brammer & Millington, 2004; Godfrey, 2005).\n\nStrategy scholars have recently developed a construct of “moral reputation capital” that links CSR activities to shareholder value from the corporate reputation theory (Godfrey, 2005; Godfrey et al., 2009; Muller & Kraussl, 2011). The “insurance” perspective suggests that firms with strong reputations for CSR will be able to preserve firm value in times of crises better than firms with weak reputations for CSR (Godfrey et al., 2009; Schnietz & Epstein, 2005). When negative events occur, stakeholders will respond based on both the negative effects of the act and the perceived state of mind and intentions of the offender (Godfrey et al., 2009). Godfrey et al. (2009) argued that moral reputation capital derived from CSR would reduce the overall severity of sanctions, but firms with no CSR activity lack this form of buffering goodwill and stand exposed to potentially greater impacts.\n\nSo far the discussion suggests that the actual relationship between CSR and financial performance is generally positive from stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory formulations.\n\nDespite a long and contentious debate about the theory of CSR business case, the majority of results from prior empirical studies and meta-analyses have pointed to a positive relationship between CSR and CFP. Among the 109 published studies from 1972 to 2002 collected by Margolis and Walsh (2003), almost half of the studies (54) reported a positive relationship, only 7 studies found a negative relationship, and 28 results pointed to nonsignificant relationships. Based on previous findings, the present authors expect a generally positive association between CSR and CFP in this meta-analysis. If CSR contributes to CFP, then it rejects the idea that CSR is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization. If social responsibility contributes to CFP, then a firm’s resources are being used to advance the interests of shareholders, the rightful claimants in the neoclassical economy (Margolis & Walsh, 2003).\n\nBased on these assumptions, the authors assert the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 1:\n\nCSR will have a positive impact on CFP.\n\n# Direction of Causality Between CSR and CFP\n\nThe authors further shed light on the causal relation between CSR and financial performance. Three views on the direction of causality between CSR\n\nWang et al. - 7\n\nand CFP have been tested empirically: (a) the view that prior CSR positively influences CFP, (b) the view that prior CFP positively influences CSR, and (c) the view defining a recursive relationship between both constructs (Surroca et al., 2010).\n\nThe first research stream, related to instrumental stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory, mentioned earlier, suggests that prior CSR positively influences subsequent CFP. This view was confirmed by many empirical studies conducted in different contexts, such as Barnett and Salomon (2006), Bhattacharya and Sen (2003), Brammer and Millington (2004), and Godfrey et al. (2009). The second strand of literature is supported by slack resources theory, which proposes that firms with available slack resources from high levels of financial performance may spend those resources on “doing good by doing well” and those resource allocations may result in improved CSR overall (Waddock & Graves\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
