This finding is also consistent with previous studies in different markets, including Brazil (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Nunes et al., 2010).\n\nContrary to the expected negative effect, there is no effect of debt over CSP according to the results. In fact, debt costs and possible undesirable external control from creditors does not seem to adversely affect CSP. That could be because of the fact that more concern on firm sustainability is suggested to be positive to external financing given that the funding market may take such concern into account when analyzing firm funding requests (Magnanelli and Izzo, 2017; Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). This conflicting situation between favorable and unfavorable effect of debt over CSP may lead to the absence of association between debt and an index that incorporates CSR and sustainability.\n\nAdditional models were estimated to assess whether the financial crisis (2007-2009) which affected many countries, was able to deter CSP of Brazilian firms given its potential to decrease firms’ financial performance with possible negative effect on CSP. Table VII summarizes results of model estimates that integrate period dummy variables that refer to the periods before, during and after crisis. The findings signal that indeed the crisis period had an adverse effect on CSP (Table VII; Panel A). Mainly, important is that in the period after crisis there has been observed a strong trend for improvement in Brazilian firms’ CSP (Table VII; Panel B).\n\nOverall, the findings show that indeed firm membership to an environmental risky industry is an important firm attribute for higher public accountability and better CSP. In fact, Brazilian\n\n# Table VII\n\n|Variable|(i)|(ii)|(iii)|(iv)|(v)|(vi)|(vii)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Panel A Panel data logistic models of CSP on firm attributes taking into account period before crisis and during crisis of 2007-2009| | | | | | | |\n|MAJOR|0.953| | | | | | |\n|HI5| |2.167| | | | | |\n|OWNC1| | |1.911| | | | |\n|OWNC2| | | |2.188| | | |\n|OWNC3| | | | |2.069| | |\n|OWNC4| | | | | |1.716| |\n|OWNC5| | | | | | |1.645|\n|RSKIND|1.772|1.775|1.767|1.839|1.806|1.747|1.726|\n|ROA|0.533|0.558|0.511|0.516|0.501|0.465|0.441|\n|SIZE|1.905|1.872|1.882|1.899|1.893|1.890|1.889|\n|GOPP|0.588|0.577|0.587|0.583|0.584|0.592|0.594|\n|BEFORE_CRISIS|0.534|0.434|0.460|0.447|0.466|0.503|0.515|\n|CRISIS_2007-2009|0.710|0.656|0.666|0.639|0.652|0.679|0.685|\n|Constant|33.93|33.15|33.12|32.99|32.83|32.95|32.96|\n|N. obs.|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|2,685|\n|N. firms| | | | | | | |\n|Wald chi2(14)|327|327|327|327|327|327|327|\n| |99.30|100.29|99.83|100.24|99.94|98.87|98.39|\n|p-value|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|0.000|\n\nPanel B – panel data logistic models of CSP on firm attributes taking into account period before crisis and after crisis\n\n|MAJOR|0.953| | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|HI5| |2.167| | | | | |\n|OWNC1| | |1.911| | | | |\n|OWNC2| | | |2.188| | | |\n|OWNC3| | | | |2.069| | |\n|OWNC4| | | | | |1.716| |\n|OWNC5| | | | | | |1.645|\n|RSKIND|1.772|1.775|1.767|1.839|1.806|1.747|1.726|\n|ROA|0.533|0.558|0.511|0.516|0.501|0.465|0.441|\n|SIZE|1.905|1.872|1.882|1.899|1.893|1.890|1.889|\n|GOPP|0.588|0.577|0.587|0.583|0.584|0.592|0.594|\n|BEFORE_CRISIS|0.175|0.222|0.206|0.191|0.185\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
