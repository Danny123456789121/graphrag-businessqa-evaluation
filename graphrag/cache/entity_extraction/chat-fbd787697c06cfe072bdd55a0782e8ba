Husted (2000: 34) agrees with the narrative reviews in this area, stating that it is ‘premature’ to conclude that adaptation to market and non-market environments might force organizations to consider social issues and CSP in their day-to-day strategizing. Our meta-analysis suggests the opposite. In fact, some of our observed correlations are higher than the correlations typically found between strategy-structure fit and CFP (Amburgey and Dacin 1994; Donaldson 1987). Despite those lower correlations, the strategy-structure-performance paradigm is firmly grounded on an economic survival mechanism (across industry contexts) analogous to Hypothesis 1. On the one hand, our meta-analysis contradicts Rowley and Berman’s (2000) suggestion that there cannot be a consistently positive relationship between CSP and CFP. On the other hand, in agreement with Rowley and Berman (2000), we demonstrate that the universally positive relationship varies (from highly positive to modestly positive) because of contingencies, such as reputation effects, market measures of CFP, or CSP disclosures.\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Organization Studies\n\n# 24(3)\n\nTraditionally, researchers have worried that any positive correlations are artefactual, due to halo effects (Brown and Perry 1994, 1995; Wood 1995). However, it is important to keep in mind that the only credible halo linkage would be from CFP to CSP; that is, companies that perform better financially receive higher CSP ratings, regardless of their true underlying CSP. The meta-analytic breakdown has shown that the potential halo effect (CFP → lagged CSP correlation) does not dominate a weaker CSP → lagged CFP correlation and distort results. In fact, the two correlations are identical at two digits (.29, see Table 2a). Also, when all potentially problematic studies are removed (that is, those that measure CSP reputations only and those that measure CFP with a survey instrument), the meta-analysis still shows a non-trivial positive ‘true-score’ correlation of .15 (see Table 1). Furthermore, the halo argument would suggest a much higher correlation between external (market) CFP and CSP reputation than between internal (accounting) CFP and CSP reputation. In fact, however, the correlations in both subgroups were similar (entries 2.b.1 versus 2.b.2 in Table 4a).\n\nWhen the CFP survey measures and CSP reputation measures are removed, the cross-study variation of robs can be shown to be increasingly a function of the artefacts of sampling and measurement error (44 percent; see entry 2 in Table 1). Thus, many of the negative findings in individual studies are artefactual, so that the generalization of a positive CSP –CFP relationship applies more broadly than previously suggested (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995). We can, therefore, state with some confidence that the association between CSP and lagged CFP is not negative. Moreover, the causation seems to be that CSP and CFP mutually affect each other through a virtuous cycle: financially successful companies spend more because they can afford it, but CSP also helps them become a bit more successful. Moreover, the le drawer analysis indicates that the present findings cannot be dismissed by availability bias.\n\nThis meta-analysis both rejects and confirms notions developed by neo-classical economists. On the one hand, it rejects the idea that CSP is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization (Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958). Instead, organizational effectiveness may be a broad concept encompassing both financial and social performance (Andrews 1987; Judge 1994). It is also worth noting that, according to most credible versions of stakeholder theory, shareholders are legitimate stakeholders. On the other hand, our findings also confirm the notions of libertarians such as Friedman that government regulation in the area of CSP may not be necessary. If the statistical relationship between CSP and CFP were negative, bottom-line considerations might constitute barriers to outcomes desired by the public, which in turn would make government intervention, which serves the public ‘interest’, a necessity. Yet, with CSP, the case for regulation and social control by governments (acting on behalf of ‘society’ or ‘the public’) is relatively weak because organizations and their shareholders tend to benefit from managers’ prudent analysis, evaluation, and balancing of multiple constituents’ preferences. Therefore, these actions are most likely adopted.\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nvoluntarily, based on managers’ cost-benefit analyses of a firm’s investments. In contrast, ‘socially responsible’ command-and-control regulation may prescribe inflexible means–ends chains that are inappropriate for a particular firm’s non-market and market environments (Majumdar and Marcus 2001).\n\n# Implications for Future Research\n\nThe meta-analysis helps to identify areas in which there have been relatively few studies conducted, and which warrant more research (for example, social responsibility values and market CFP; see Table 4a). Additionally, the analysis shows areas in which the unexplained variance across studies remains\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
