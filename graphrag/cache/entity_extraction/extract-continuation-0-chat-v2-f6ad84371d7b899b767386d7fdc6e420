Thus, our results underpin previous findings: at the worst case, investors in ESG mutual funds can expect to lose nothing compared to conventional fund investments (Hamilton, Jo, and Statman 1993; Humphrey and Tan 2014; Revelli and Viviani 2015).\n\nRegional findings reveal that within developed markets, there is a higher share of positive results from North America compared to Europe and Asia/Australia. This can partially be explained by the lower share of portfolio studies within the sub-sample for North America. Within the individual E, S, and G categories, E and G exhibit a slightly more positive relation than S-focused studies. However, the difference between E and S studies with positive and negative outcomes is marginal (maximum 4.3% percentage points). Meta-analyses focusing on social aspects (van Wijk, Jansen, and Lyles 2008; Crook et al. 2011; Stam, Arzlanian, and Elfring 2014) usually find higher correlations, in contrast to environmental-focused meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014). We conclude that no single E, S, and G category demonstrates a meaningful superior positive relation to CFP.\n\nThe strength of our analysis is the aggregation of a large number of studies through secondary research on review studies, but it is also uncovers the inherit limitations of the underlying studies. One of them is the lengthy academic publication period of primary and likewise secondary research. Although our second-level review study includes all relevant review studies published until the end of 2014, it loses some representativeness for primary studies with a publication date of 2012 and younger.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThrough a second-level review of 60 review studies – including both, vote-count studies and meta-analyses – on the ESG–CFP relation, we are able to combine more than 3700 study results from more than 2200 unique primary studies. Based on this sample, we clearly find evidence for the business case for ESG investing. This finding contrasts with the common perception among investors. The contrary perception of investors may be biased due to findings of portfolio studies, which exhibit, on average, a neutral/mixed ESG–CFP performance relation. It is important to be aware that the results of these (to date about 150 studies) are overlaid by various systematic and idiosyncratic risks in portfolios and, in the case of mutual funds, by implementation costs. Still more than 2100 other – in particular company-focused – empiric studies suggest a positive ESG relation.\n\nESG outperformance opportunities exist in many areas of the market. In particular, we find that this holds true for North America, Emerging Markets, and in nonequity asset classes. Our results propose that capital markets so far demonstrate no consistent learning effects regarding the ESG–CFP relation: Since the mid-1990s, the positive correlation patterns in primary studies have been stable over time (Table 1).\n\n# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment\n\nBased on this exhaustive review effort, our main conclusion is: the orientation toward long-term responsible investing should be important for all kinds of rational investors in order to fulfill their fiduciary duties and may better align investors’ interests with the broader objectives of society. This requires a detailed and profound understanding of how to integrate ESG criteria into investment processes in order to harvest the full potential of value-enhancing ESG factors. A key area for future research is to better understand the interaction of different ESG criteria in portfolios and the relevance of specific ESG sub-criteria for CFP. These insights will shed further light on the ESG determinants for long-term positive performance impacts.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors like to thank The PRI, Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (Deutsche AWM) and two anonymous reviewers for their support.

The statistical explanatory power in studies is usually low and the primary study might come to the conclusion, based on its calculated significance values and sample sizes, that a certain effect is nonsignificant. Vote-count reviews may also come to biased conclusions by simply concentrating on significant statistics of primary studies to decide if an effect across studies is positive or negative. Potentially they overestimate nonsignificant results. Besides, the explanatory power of vote-count studies shrinks with the increasing number of (contradictory) studies. Meta-studies directly import effect sizes and samples sizes to compute a summary effect across all primary studies. This aggregation method of data could better detect existing correlation patterns in combined samples (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter et al. 1982).\n2. The term “second-level review study” describes our aggregation of first-level review studies, regardless if they are vote-count studies or meta-analyses. “Second-order meta-analysis” is the psychometric aggregation technique for first-level meta-analyses as introduced by Schmidt and Oh (2013). This technique is used for the statistical aggregation of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample to compute summary effect sizes.\n3. Portfolio studies comprise of studies on long-short ESG portfolios and in particular studies on ESG mutual funds and indices.\n4. Two of the typical ways to treat missing data are model-based distribution estimation and the replacement of missing data (imputation) with estimated ones (Schafer and Graham 2002; Tsikriktsis 2005). The latter is applied due to the nonparametric nature of the data.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal that publishes research on sustainable finance and investment practices, focusing on the relationship between ESG criteria and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is an organization that encourages investors to use responsible investment to enhance returns and better manage risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management is a financial services company that provides investment management and wealth management services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESG<|>EVENT<|>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) refers to the financial performance of a company, often measured in terms of profitability, revenue, and market share.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>GEO<|>A region that includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico, noted for having a higher share of positive results in ESG mutual funds compared to Europe and Asia/Australia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>A continent that is part of the developed markets, which has a lower share of positive results from ESG mutual funds compared to North America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA/AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Regions that are part of the developed markets, which have a lower share of positive results from ESG mutual funds compared to North America.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>PRI<|>The journal acknowledges the support of PRI in promoting responsible investment practices<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT<|>DEUTSCHE ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT<|>The journal acknowledges the support of Deutsche AWM in the field of sustainable finance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESG<|>CFP<|>The relationship between ESG criteria and corporate financial performance is a central theme of the journal's research<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>ESG<|>North America shows a higher share of positive results in ESG mutual funds, indicating a strong relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPE<|>ESG<|>Europe has a lower share of positive results in ESG mutual funds compared to North America, indicating a weaker relationship<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIA/AUSTRALIA<|>ESG<|>Asia/Australia also shows a lower share of positive results in ESG mutual funds compared to North America, indicating a weaker relationship<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
