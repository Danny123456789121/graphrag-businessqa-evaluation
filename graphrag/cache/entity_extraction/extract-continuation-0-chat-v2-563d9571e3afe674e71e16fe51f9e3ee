The temperature shock factor is the tracking portfolio return, TSF = bRt.\n\n# Alternative Specification 2\n\nWe avoid the specifics of the temperature trend model of Campbell and Diebold (2005) by assuming instead a stochastic trend model of temperature with unknown drift term to identify the tracking portfolio. Estimate the following model over the entire sample:\n\nTGRTH+12 = c + eZE1 + gZC1 + bRt + tt−12 (4b)\n\nwhere TGRTH+12 = 100 × log(Tt+1,t+12/Tt-11,t) is the log difference in the average annual temperature. The variables are the same as in the benchmark specification: Rt = (SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, BH)′; ZE1 = (RF−1, DEF−1, TERM−1); ZC1 is the lagged growth rate in the average temperature; and the temperature shock factor is the tracking portfolio return TSF = bRt.\n\n# Alternative Specification 3\n\nWe avoid the tracking portfolio approach altogether in favor of a standard two-pass approach with specific risk corrections based on the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor model, using unexpected temperature changes as the temperature shock factor. Estimate the following model in a rolling fashion (for each month s we estimate for the months s-120 to s-1) to avoid using future information; generate an error term es using the 10 years of data preceding month s so that for each month only the residual for the last month of the following regression is utilized to serve as the unexpected temperature change:\n\nTmt = C + A⋅t + Σi=110 Siseasonali + LTm + et−i (4c)\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nwhere Ttm represents the monthly temperature, t is the deterministic time trend, seasonali is the seasonal dummy variable for month i. The lag length is selected by the Schwartz-Bayes Criterion.\n\nThen we calculate the expected temperature based on the estimated parameters. The temperature shock factor is the unexpected change in the monthly temperature, TSF* = ett (the asterisk indicates that the temperature shock factor is not a tradable asset in this case).\n\nThe specifics of the tracking portfolios generated by the first and second robustness approaches (ALT1 and ALT2) are in Table 1 (the third approach does not use a tracking portfolio). Panel B in this table illustrates that the mean tracking portfolio return continues to be robustly significantly negative for the alternative set of basis assets and the different trend specification for temperatures.\n\n# 4. Standard Asset Pricing Models: Structural Approaches\n\nThe tracking portfolio approach of Lamont (2001) in Section 3 estimates the risk premium of the temperature shock factor without specifying an equilibrium asset-pricing model. In this section, we supplement these results by estimating the risk premium of temperature shocks within the standard multi-factor models. This approach enables us to obtain the sensitivities to the temperature shock factor of particular industries/firms, to address Hypothesis 2, and to identify the aggregate quantitative impact on the cost of equity capital and how this impact changes over time, to address Hypothesis 3.\n\nand the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM. These are the most common systematic risk models. For our asset-pricing specifications, we take the Fama-French (1996) three-factor model temperature shock factor is added to these specifications as an additional factor. If temperature shock impacts are adverse, we expect to find negative loadings for typical firms or portfolios and a negative risk premium to compensate for the additional risk. The impact of temperature shocks.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nOn the average cost of capital can naturally be measured by the product of the premium and the average loading of assets on the temperature shock factor.\n\nWe use the Black-Jensen-Scholes (1972) / Fama-MacBeth (1973) two-pass methodology – estimating factor sensitivities in the first pass, and using these to obtain risk premia in the second pass – with standard refinements: the Shanken (1992) correction to obtain errors-in-variables-robust standard errors, accounting for the fact that factor sensitivities are estimated, and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) correction to generate misspecification-robust standard errors.\n\nLewellen, Nagel and Shanken (2010) argue that using as test assets only size–BM portfolios, as is common in the empirical asset-pricing literature, can be highly misleading due to the strong factor structure of these portfolios. They propose to expand the set of test assets to include other portfolios, such as industry portfolios. Including industry portfolios is particularly attractive for our research since the climate-economy literature has predictions for how different industries should be affected. We thus use 55 size-value and industry portfolios (25 size-value portfolios plus 30 industry portfolios) as our test assets, instead of just 25 size-value portfolios.\n\nSince temperature variation is a systematic risk, we expect to see that the temperature shock factor is priced and that its premium is negative.
