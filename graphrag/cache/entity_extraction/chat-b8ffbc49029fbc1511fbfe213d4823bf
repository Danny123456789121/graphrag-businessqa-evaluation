The release of Copilot is seen as a revolution of AI-assisted software programming and has attracted much attention since its release [63]. Despite the fact that GenAI for code models still have room for improvement in the quality of their outputs – e.g., TransCoder only produces a correct translation 30%-70% of the time depending on the source and target language [88] – recent work by Weisz et al. [100] suggests that software engineers may nonetheless be tolerant of using such models in their work. Given the emerging productization of GenAI for code models, we believe it is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of questions software engineers will have when working with such models to guide technical XAI work and design solutions to answer them.\n\n# 2.2 Explainable AI\n\nExplainable AI (XAI) has spurred great academic, industry, and public interests in the past few years, thanks to the popularity of inscrutable “opaque-box” ML models. Many XAI techniques have\n\n# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design\n\n# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\n\nbeen developed for discriminative ML models, both through pro-\n\nducing directly interpretable models [14, 44] and generating post-\n\nhoc explanations for a trained opaque-box model [47, 62, 80, 104]. These explanations take a variety of forms. For example, global explanations provide an overview of the model logic, while local ex-\n\nplanations elucidate the rationale behind a particular output. A full review of XAI techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and can\n\nbe found in many recent survey papers [1, 29, 55, 56]. Our work is most closely informed by, and intends to bridge, the emerging topic of explainability for generative models, and the inter-disciplinary field of Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) [21, 22, 52].\n\nCompared to discriminative models, much less attention has been paid to developing XAI techniques for generative AI models. Some explored ways to make generative models more directly in-\n\nterpretable, which is often framed as making the representation learning of a GenAI model in its latent dimensions semantically meaningful so people can directly examine the model internals [28]. For example, disentanglement is a technique that seeks map-\n\npings between high-dimensional inputs and low-dimensional rep-\n\nresentations such that representation dimensions correspond to the ground-truth factors that generated the data [83]. Accordingly, some proposed disentanglement measures [16, 84] as a way to evaluate a GenAI model’s interpretability. A recent study by Ross et al. [86] proposed a user evaluation task to evaluate the human interpretability of generative models, by the ability for people to interactively modify representations to reconstruct target instances.\n\nOthers explored visualization approaches to present the repre-\n\nsentations to help users (often model developers) make sense of what the GenAI model has learned. For example, Ross et al. [86] use sliders to let users dynamically modify representation dimensions and see how corresponding instances change. Recent HCI works also explored the approach of “explainability through interaction\" for generative models, by allowing users to interact with the input or guiding output generation process [59, 60, 86, 103]. Through observing immediate feedback from changes to the model output, people can make better sense of how a generative model works. For example, Zhang and Banovic developed a system that allows users to interactively explore the output space of an image generative model to assess the model quality [103].\n\nThese varied approaches suggest that explainability is still a less than well-defined notion for GenAI. Here we adopt a HCXAI posi-\n\ntion that explainability, or the effectiveness of explanation, should be defined as enabling people’s understanding of the AI to achieve their goals [52]. With this human-centered definition, many have ar-\n\ngued that it is necessary to provide transparent information beyond the model internals, such as its performance, limitations, training data, and development procedure, to enable a holistic understanding of the AI and more actionable insights [11, 48, 73, 94]. As discussed, Liao et al. proposed to identify users’ explainability needs by elic-\n\niting the questions they ask to understand the AI [48, 50]. This method allows approaching XAI from the users’ perspective and thoroughly identify transparent information they need to achieve\n\nan understanding necessary for their goals, which, in the context of GenAI for code, could be about optimizing for the usage of the AI system and overall productivity. Liao et al.’s work was based on prior HCI work that defines “intelligibility types\" of information for context-aware intelligent systems by prototypical questions such\n\nas Input, Output, Why, What-if, etc. [53, 54]. It also draws on social science literature showing that people’s explanatory goals can be expressed in different kinds of questions [34]. We build on this line of work and adapt the question-drive method to elicit users’ explainability needs for GenAI for code.\n\n# 2.3 Human-centered approaches to AI\n\nThe term Human-centered AI has emerged in many academic works and public discussions [22, 25, 45, 65, 85, 89]. While definitions vary, human-centered approaches to AI aim to develop AI systems that serve the needs, improve the conditions, and align with the val-\n\nues of human stakeholders. Research begins to develop practical methods that can help achieve these goals.
