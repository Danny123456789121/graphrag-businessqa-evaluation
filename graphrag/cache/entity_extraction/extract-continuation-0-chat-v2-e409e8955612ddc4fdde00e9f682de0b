Thirty event studies were found to either fit the above definition or involve illegal behavior.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\nirresponsible and illegal behavior (actions where welfare is affected negatively), two studies (Meznar; Nigh, ad Kwok, 1994; Patten, 1990) from South Africa (ostensibly socially responsible behavior) were not included. Another study (Rubin; Murphy, and Jarrell, 1988) was excluded because it failed to provide a piece of critical data needed for this meta-analysis (i.e., the value of the t statistic from their hypothesis test). This left 27 event studies, with a total of 2,161 incidents of socially irresponsible or illegal behavior to be meta-analyzed. These 27 studies are grouped by their events in Table 2, which shows how each study fits the inclusionary/exclusionary requirements.\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that this meta-analysis excluded from its sample those event studies using monthly return data (typically written in the 1970s and early 1980s). As Brown and Warner (1985) showed, such coarse analyses were not very dependable because too much noise could be picked up in an event month besides the effect of an event itself:\n\n# Data Analyzed\n\nMost meta-analyses make use of correlation coefficients (e.g., Cohen, 1993; Damanpour; 1991; Williams and Livingstone, 1994). Event studies do not; however; produce correlation coefficients. This makes the methodology of this article different from most other meta-analyses. Event studies produce two numbers of interest: test statistic values and size-of-return data. However, as will be explained, size-of-return data cannot be used. Indeed, anyone meta-analyzing event studies will be forced to perform the meta-analysis on test statistic values. The following two subsections explain why the test statistic values are used and why the return sizes reported in the event studies cannot be used. The data used in the meta-analysis are presented in Table 3.\n\n# Why test statistic values can be used\n\nEvery event study employs hypothesis tests to see if abnormal returns around the event day are significant: Such hypothesis testing makes use of either the student's t distribution or the standard normal (z) distribution. Of the 27 events included in this meta-analysis, 15 reported t-statistic values, 9 reported z-statistic values, and 3 studies reported p values. The z's were directly changed into t's on the assumption that as sample size increases, the student's t distribution approaches the normal distribution (Marascuilo and Serlin; 1988). This was done for those studies in the meta-analysis.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n                              ] 1 1N               0                      8 1\n                    45\n                              8                  HL] ]                    Q\n                   4 1\n                   2\n                   8              53}                                     W\n               1238 6        HH ]148 010                                Jl *H 4 ]\n                              ] W 4\n                              2                  [ L6                    935\n                       13,               5           4\n                      1      YHhla 1\n                              2 8 g\n                                                  4                      00 Ia\n                             1 0 ] 2 81 ] 4 1 2\n                                               2 g\n                                                  39 1 2                WH\n                                                                          2 g\n                                                                             8      H\n                      Q\n                               Hhhh4 30                     {            1 0 1 9 09\n         1\n         4        Ji          5                      8                      HH 41\n     1 1          1 21 Au5                     HHhHH3L 1        {6 H4 01 I g\n                    1/7                         3228 8                  1 43\n                                                                        6\n232\n          Downloaded frombas.sagepub.comby guest on December 3, 2014\n\nHH5\n   E 3]7 H#xIL\n            13 3 V0\nV1 1 1\n 8 21\n   4 8 1\n ]i\n1 2\n   1 7 11  III\n           1[\n0 ] 1 1\n       2 8 8\n 8 31 1    2 2g82 1 1\n      2    2 0 1} 1 17\nLI1   1    1       4\n           5\n1              8\n9         Jlh5\n5\n3          8\n                                                      233\n             Downloaded frombas.sagepub.comby guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\n# Table 3\n\n# Data for Meta-Analysis\n\n|Study|Test Statistic|\n|---|---|\n|Peltzman (1981)|322|\n|Garbade et al.
