Despite the current controversy surrounding generative AI, our empirical analysis acknowledges its positive aspects for market participants and researchers based on the finding that it can effectively inform firms’ risk management capabilities.\n\nAlthough generative AI was introduced in 1966, when Joseph Weizenbaum proposed the generative AI program ELIZA at MIT, the development of generative AI technologies did not take off until 2020, when OpenAI introduced Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3 (GPT-3). Generative AI builds on the technical development of descriptive AI, summarizing or analyzing data and generating new samples that do not exist in the database by learning historical data patterns (Orzechowski and Moore 2022; Savage 2023). Although generative AI encompasses a wide range of models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Large Language Models (LLMs) are the models most frequently explored in business and finance studies (i.e. Lopez-Lira and Tang 2023). LLMs are trained on billions of textual data from various sources, and they can capture the complexity of natural language and construct the relationships between different words to serve users’ specific text generation goals (Savage 2023). The most popular LLM tool, ChatGPT, was launched by OpenAI in November 2022 (Dwivedi et al. 2023) and trained on a large text corpus as a chatbot to process natural language and generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. In just two months, ChatGPT’s monthly active users grew to 100 million (Clarke 2023). OpenAI followed in March 2023 with the most powerful generative AI, GPT-4, which proved to have significant advantages over earlier GPT versions in several tasks (Buberk et al. 2023). Other large companies invest heavily in developing the latest LLMs, such as Meta with LLaMA and Google with Bard.\n\nAs many generative AI tools have emerged in a short period, they have come to be seen as capable of bringing about a massive revolution in the financial and business sectors. Therefore, using them efficiently and recognizing their limitations has become the next major topic of research interest. There have been several successful generative AI applications in the business and finance sectors. For example, Microsoft’s combination of its Bing search engine and ChatGPT resulted in New Bing, which can better understand proposed questions, generate more reliable and comprehensive answers, and provide answers with creative capabilities based on appropriate prompts. In addition, many companies use generative AI tools to create videos for product design and thus increase operational efficiency (Gil, 2020), provide 24-hour digital customer service that is consistently polite and patient, or offer marketing services such as customer-oriented promotions for special events. Given the robust capabilities of generative AI, its use in business and finance fields is expected to become increasingly widespread.\n\nGenerative AI is a double-edged sword, given its potential limitations and ethical concerns. Intending to promote the sustainable development and application of generative AI technology, we specifically link relevant debates to business and finance through a comprehensive overview of the academic and business sectors and specific examples to illustrate our views. The examples in Section 3 suggest that ChatGPT 4\n---\n# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES\n\n# 3\n\noutperforms ChatGPT 3.5 and Bard in following user instructions to provide personalized service, risk management, and decision support. In Section 4, we test the ability of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 to perform sentiment analysis in financial studies. Our results show that the negative sentiment of companies captured by ChatGPT 4 can predict better risk management capabilities and less volatile stock performance after introducing an environmental policy, which can prompt investors to adjust their portfolios promptly. In Section 5, our examples demonstrate one of the limitations of generative AI: the responses generated by ChatGPT are sensitive to tiny differences in the prompt template.\n\nThis study contributes to the literature on generative AI techniques in business and finance to provide insights into their practical and potential applications. Most studies in this stream only briefly mention how generative AI can be applied in business (Ali and Aysan 2023; George, George, and Martin 2023) and academia (Alshater 2022; Dowling and Lucey 2023; Korinek 2023; Singh and Singh 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth 2022) without performing in-depth investigation by using generative AI tools. For example, Cao and Zhai (2023) offer specific examples and recommendations for using ChatGPT as a potential technical aid to finance and accounting researchers. We differ from previous studies by providing a case study that uses ChatGPT to analyze firms’ sentiments towards policy implementation. Our empirical results suggest that generative AI can inform firms about their risk management capabilities, making it an ideal decision-support tool in financial markets. Besides, we also add to the literature on the opportunities and challenges that generative AI poses for development (Beraja, Yang, and Yuchtman 2023; Gherhes et al. 2023; Lu and Zhou 2021; Yin, Cai, and Huang 2023; Zhou et al. 2020) by providing guidance on building a regulatory framework for generative AI to address its limitations and concerns, and highlight important questions for further interdisciplinary research on generative AI in business and finance.\n\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a broad overview of the literature on the applications and limitations of generative AI in business and finance. Section 3 outlines the applications of generative AI in different domains within the business and finance\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
