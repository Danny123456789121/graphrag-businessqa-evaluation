Generosity in the form of relative donations could be more important to customers and other stakeholders than the absolute amount of donations (Patten 2008) or the mere existence of donations. Furthermore, according to the theory of an inverted u-shaped relationship between CP and CFP (Wang et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2015), one could expect that the initial participation in donation programs yields higher CFP benefits than ever-increasing sums of charitable donations. This is why we ask whether a positive relationship persists for these different types of CP indicators.\n\n# RQ3b: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the employed CP indicator?\n\nBesides the general indicator measuring CP, there are more aspects to be considered about the charitable donation indicators that have been assessed for empirical analyses. The first aspect concerns the donation medium that was captured. According to the definition of CP, charitable donations can be made in the form of cash, in-kind goods, or volunteered time (Madden et al. 2006). These different forms of resources donated to society might be perceived differently by stakeholders. Company volunteering programs, which temporarily release company paid workers from their business duties in order to work for social causes, can increase motivation of employees and foster brand identification of customers (Jones 2010; Veleva et al. 2012; Mattila and Hanks).\n\nF. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nIn-kind donations, which include the donation of company products, generate a marketing effect and simultaneously make it possible to write off excess inventory (Gao et al. 2012). As a result of these additional benefits of specific kinds of donations, it is expected that these might influence the found relationship but that the positive relationship holds for all subgroups.\n\n# RQ3c: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the donation medium included in the CP measure?\n\nThe second aspect that is notably different about the type of CP evaluated within empirical analyses concerns the time horizon of the donation. Whereas many studies examined continuous donation efforts over periods of 1 year or longer (Diltz 1995; Balabanis et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2015; Iatridis 2015), others focused on donations made directly at or after a specific event, mostly natural disasters (Muller and Kraussl 2011b; Gao et al. 2012; Qiu 2013). The special context and increased media attention of disaster relief donations might influence the impact on CFP, which is why we intend to investigate RQ3d.\n\n# RQ3d: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the time horizon of donations included in the CP measure?\n\nSample data Other contextual factors that could influence the study outcomes are the country and the year in which the data was gathered. Because of important cultural, economic, institutional, and legal differences between developed and developing countries, it is argued that the relationship between CP and CFP might differ within these two contexts (Su and He 2010; Ye and Zhang 2011). Arguments and respective findings have gone in both directions. On the one hand, in developing countries with greater market inefficiencies, CP can help to improve political connections and protect property rights (Su and He 2010). On the other hand, markets are more transparent and CSR awareness is said to be higher in developed countries. This leads to higher visibility of companies among more demanding stakeholders and could increase the influence of CP efforts on CFP (Ye and Zhang 2011; Wang and Qian 2011). Furthermore, especially in China where political affiliation is a more salient issue than in other countries, managers might use donations to enhance their political connections on a personal level instead of benefiting the company. Due to these higher agency costs assumed in countries like China, we need to ask the question:\n\n# RQ3e: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to sample country?\n\nRegarding the year of the investigation, it can be expected that found relationships have become stronger over time for several reasons. First, study designs are generally assumed to improve over time to yield stronger relationships (Combs et al. 2011). Furthermore, for this particular meta-analysis, as the differentiated analysis of specific CSR dimensions has become more important over recent years (Wang et al. 2016), more studies are expected to exist for recent decades, implying more robust meta-analysis results with growing sample sizes. Finally, due to digital technology and extended non-financial reporting, growing transparency between stakeholders and companies might have increased the impact of strategic philanthropy for business and\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\nsociety (Porter and Kramer 2002; Saiia et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2012; Rangan et al. 2015)\n\n# 2.4 Methodological moderators\n\nWhen investigating the relationship between CP and CFP, it is important to consider that there are also other variables, such as firm size, advertising intensity, or ownership structures, which might have an impact on the measured relationship. These moderating variables should be held constant or controlled for when measuring a relationship and are referred to as control variables. To account for control variables, their effect can be eliminated by using partial correlations, which hold the moderating variables constant and measure the ‘true’ relationship between CP and CFP. A number of moderators have been considered by existing studies, including firm size, industry effects, advertising intensity, R&D spending, past financial performance, or public ownership (Balabanis et al. 1998; Lev et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2015).\n\nBefore taking a closer look at the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F.
