(2009). The second strand of literature is supported by slack resources theory, which proposes that firms with available slack resources from high levels of financial performance may spend those resources on “doing good by doing well” and those resource allocations may result in improved CSR overall (Waddock & Graves, 1997). In contrast, firms that are in financial trouble may have little freedom to invest in CSR activities such as philanthropy. Some of the empirical evidence, particularly McGuire, Schneeweis, and Branch (1990) and Godfrey et al. (2009), provides support for the slack resources theory. These two previous streams of research were reconciled by Surroca et al. (2010), who argued that causation may run in both directions. That is, better CSR may lead to improved financial performance. Meanwhile, better financial performance may lead to improved CSR. This meta-analysis will test which theoretical hypothesis is right, or whether both of them are supported across the accumulated research. Based on prior studies and empirical findings (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010; Waddock & Graves, 1997), the present authors assert that the basic theoretical underpinnings of these CSR–CFP links are correct, so that there is a positive association between social and financial outcomes in both directions. This assertion involves two hypotheses:\n\n# Hypothesis 2a:\n\nA higher level of prior CSR is associated with better subsequent financial performance.\n\n# Hypothesis 2b:\n\nA better prior financial performance is associated with improved subsequent CSR.\n\n# Measurement Strategy as a Moderator of the CSR–CFP Relationship\n\nCSR is a multidimensional construct defined as the integration of the principles, processes, and policies related to social issues (Wartick & Cochran, 1985), so it is very difficult to identify and measure such a wide range of corporate social behavior. Because little clarity has been reached on the\n\n# Business & Society\n\nMeasurement of CSR, some studies have argued that the measurement problem is one fundamental reason for the uncertainty about the relationship between CSR and CFP (Waddock & Graves, 1997). To test whether different measurement strategies lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies, this meta-analysis will break down the whole samples into different CSR subsets based on different operationalizations of this construct.\n\nIn prior studies, five kinds of measurement strategies have been frequently used: (a) CSR reputation ratings (Donker, Poff, & Zahir, 2008; Soana, 2011), (b) content analysis (Aras, Aybars, & Kutlu, 2010; Karagiorgos, 2010), (c) surveys (Brik, Rettab, & Mellahi, 2011; Mishra & Suar, 2010), (d) social auditing database (J. Choi & Wang, 2009; Godfrey et al., 2009), and (e) a proxy variable such as corporate philanthropy (Muller & Kraussl, 2011; H. Wang et al., 2008).\n\nAlthough these five operationalizations are commonly used in the area of CSR research, each of them has limitations. The first type of method uses expert evaluations of corporate policies, such as in Moskowitz (1972). The validity of this methodology depends, to a great extent, on the skills and qualifications of those experts making the assessments (Abbott & Monsen, 1979). To overcome this shortcoming, Fortune magazine gathered a large number of executives, outside directors, and corporate analysts to rate firms. Fortune has conducted the ranking each Fall since 1982 and published summary results each January. The ranking covers the largest firms in 20 to 25 industry groups, with the 10 largest companies in each industry being rated on eight attributes: financial soundness, long-term investment value, use of corporate assets, quality of management, innovativeness, quality of products or services, use of corporate talent, and community and environmental responsibility. Fortune’s reputation rating was popularly used since the 1980s, but this method is viewed as a measure of overall management of a firm rather than being specific to CSR (Waddock & Graves, 1997).\n\nOther researchers have used content analysis of corporate publications such as annual reports, personal handbooks, employee newspapers, and so on. According to Abbott and Monsen (1979), content analysis is a technique for gathering data that consists of codifying qualitative information in anecdotal and literary form into categories to derive quantitative scales of varying levels of complexity. Abbott and Monsen used the Social Involvement Disclosure (SID) scale developed by Ernst and Ernst to code firms’ activities for specific social involvement. Because the research costs are reasonably low in comparison with other forms of data collection, content analysis is widely used in CSR research. However, a reliability issue may emerge when...\n\nWang et al. - 9\n\nregarding corporate publications as a source of social involvement data. That is, whether the reported variation in social activities among firms is a reflection of real activities or is only an index of company policies on communicating activities to shareholders (Abbott & Monsen, 1979).\n\nThe survey, as one of the dominant research approaches in the social science area, is often used in measuring CSR. Drawing on Carroll’s (1979) CSR construct, Aupperle et al. (1985) developed a forced-choice survey instrument to assess a corporate respondent’s social-responsibility orientation. This forced-choice methodology is commonly used to minimize the social desirability of responses. But survey methodologies still have problems relating to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BARNETT AND SALOMON<|>PERSON<|>Barnett and Salomon conducted empirical studies in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHATTACHARYA AND SEN<|>PERSON<|>Bhattacharya and Sen are researchers who contributed to the literature on CSR and its impact on financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAMMER AND MILLINGTON<|>PERSON<|>Brammer and Millington conducted studies related to CSR and its implications for businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODFREY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Godfrey and colleagues provided empirical evidence supporting the slack resources theory in CSR research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WADDOCK & GRAVES<|>PERSON<|>Waddock and Graves proposed theories linking CSR to corporate financial performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURROCA ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Surroca and colleagues reconciled different streams of research on CSR and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky and colleagues contributed to the understanding of the relationship between CSR and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a multidimensional construct involving principles, processes, and policies related to social issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) refers to the financial outcomes of a corporation's activities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARNETT AND SALOMON<|>GODFREY ET AL.<|>Both Barnett and Salomon and Godfrey et al. contributed to empirical studies in CSR and financial performance, indicating a shared research interest.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BHATTACHARYA AND SEN<|>GODFREY ET AL.<|>Both Bhattacharya and Sen and Godfrey et al. are involved in the literature on CSR and its financial implications, suggesting a connection in their research focus.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAMMER AND MILLINGTON<|>GODFREY ET AL.<|>Brammer and Millington's studies on CSR relate to Godfrey et al.'s empirical evidence, indicating a relationship in their research themes.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WADDOCK & GRAVES<|>SURROCA ET AL.<|>Waddock & Graves' theories on CSR and CFP are reconciled by Surroca et al., showing a direct relationship in their research findings.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>WADDOCK & GRAVES<|>Orlitzky et al. support the theories proposed by Waddock & Graves regarding CSR and CFP, indicating a strong relationship in their research.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>CSR is linked to CFP, as better CSR practices can lead to improved financial performance, establishing a direct relationship between the two concepts.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
