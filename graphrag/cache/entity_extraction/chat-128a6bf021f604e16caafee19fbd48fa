This milestone would mark the beginning of a truly intelligent algorithm. What makes this particularly tricky is when such a milestone is achieved is the lack of common agreement when it comes to the definition of intelligence. It is usually defined by a set of terms such as logic, understanding, planning, emotional knowledge, self-awareness, creativity, problem solving and learning (Tegmark, 2017). Generative AI, in contrast with the Narrow AI that we use nowadays would be “conscious” which is understood as self-aware. Zimbardo and Ruch (1977) define consciousness as being aware of one’s cognitive processes. Generative models are getting closer to that definition but very few experts would claim that truly GAI is achievable in the next few years. Also the “Chinese room” analogy by Searle (D. Cole, 2020) makes the point that an entity that is completely unaware of the meaning of symbols it is processing, may still do a perfectly good work in processing them and come across as “intelligent” (Searle, 1989).\n\nWhen it comes to the economy and job market a technical revolution comparable with the introduction of the Internet is being witnessed. It is certain that the adoption of GAI technologies will create new professions—both highly and less specialized. This is already happening. When the maturity and trust level of humans reaches a tipping point it is very likely that several professions will be either augmented or entirely replaced by GAI applications. Depending on the business model—humans may become either a premium tier or, in a more dystopian variant, a cheaper, lower quality alternative to GAI. Some companies mostly in the news / publishing sector started restructuring activities, laying people off quoting the technological shift and adoption of AI.\n\nGAI may be such a technology that “we develop quicker than we can fully understand it”. That may be the reason why in March 2023 an open letter was created and signed by several influential personalities in the AI world calling for a six-month break in the development of giant AI models “we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4” (Future of Life, 2023). The main worry does not seem to be that a super powerful AI would take over. This is more\n\n# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023\n\nof a strong signal that we have a profound new technology in our hands and caution and better understanding of possible implications is needed before even more powerful tools are created. Those implications include the impact on economies and the job market but also the potential commercial domination of the very few companies or organizations that can afford to build such powerful tools. The problem with such calls is that the pause on advancements will simply not happen. Currently a race among a few dominant market players over the next technological paradigm is being witnessed. In other words, what Microsoft’s Bing has lost to Google in terms of Internet it now has a rare occasion to win back. Also one prominent signatory of the research stop proposal is Elon Musk. Many experts immediately referred to the possibility that it is a strategy to win time to advance his own business ventures in this area (the company is called X.AI).\n\nWhile the voluntary stop on research will simply not happen there is a room for regulators to step in. The questions of transparency, ethics, privacy and intellectual property in both building and operating the GAI models can and should be addressed by regulations. Another area where the law can help is by ensuring equal access to the technology and prevention of an unhealthy concentration of the market that would lead to a monopoly or oligopoly situation in GAI technology.\n\n# References\n\n- BBC.
