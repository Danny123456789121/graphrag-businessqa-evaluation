When the sample is extended to contain concurrent and subsequent time lag measurements jointly, this relationship persists (rm = 0.121, k = 83, n = 96, 687, p = 0.002).\n\nThis finding could not be confirmed for all investigated subgroups. However, for each of the included control variables the calculated mean correlation coefficients remains positive, with significant relationships for advertising intensity (rm = 0.098, k = 4, n = 13, 568, p = 0.025) and public ownership (rm = 0.129, k = 6, n = 10, 834, p < 0.001), and with insignificant results for firm size and industry effects, which were both controlled by the same subsample of studies (rm = 0.139, k = 24, n = 41, 047, p = 0.128), as well as past financial performance (rm = 0.101, k = 5, n = 8, 243, p = 0.120). When concurrent relationships were added to the sample, all the subgroups which had controlled for one of these variables showed significantly positive relationships, except for the subsample which had controlled for public ownership (rm = 0.083, k = 9, n = 16, 840, p = 0.102).\n\n# 5 Discussion\n\n# 5.1 Summary and interpretation of findings\n\nAll findings regarding our research questions are discussed in the following sections and summarized in Table 4. Additionally, following the idea of evidence based management (Barends et al. 2014), we deduct exemplary consequences for management control from the results yielded by our meta-analysis. Consequently, for each subgroup where a significant positive relationship was found, Table 4 outlines conclusions for the integration of CP into management control systems.\n\nRQ1—general CP–CFP relationship Based on a sample of 100 bivariate effect sizes, the general existence of a positive relationship between CP and CFP was confirmed by our meta-analysis results. This relationship formed the foundation of our study and was tested for its dependency on different study designs.\n\nRQ2—time-lagged measurements The first and most important question that we posed was whether the positive relationship would hold when temporal sequences of variable measurement were considered in a way that allows for the implication of a causal relationship between CP and CFP. The subgroup of effect sizes that measured CFP prior to CP, which might have shown empirical evidence for the slack resources theory, did not show a significant positive relationship. Studies that used concurrent and subsequent measurement of CFP, on the other hand, did show a significant positive relationship. This finding supports arguments of stakeholder theory and the idea that CP as a part of organizational belief and value systems can positively influence a company’s financial performance (Simons 1994). Furthermore, this provides arguments for the stronger implementation of CP into all four of Simons levers of management control (Simons 1994).\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\n# RQ3—study design factors\n\nContrary to previous results of other meta-analyses (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Margolis et al. 2009), the relationship between CP and CFP was not found to differ between subgroups using either accounting or market-based measures (RQ3a). This finding suggests that stockholders either indeed appreciate the reputational capital built by CP or they perceive giving to charity as a positive signal of strong financial performance. Either way, stockholders positively acknowledge CP activities. Similarly, internal accounting performance measures show a positive effect on CFP.\n\nBesides the different possibilities of measuring CFP, it was also assessed if the indicator used to measure CP changed the results. First of all, the relationship remained significantly positive regardless of the CP indicator and it made no significant difference if CP was measured by a donation dummy, absolute donations, or relative donations (RQ3b). Furthermore, the two lettered subgroups of studies measuring CP with absolute or relative donations showed about the same strength in its relationship to CFP. A possible explanation for this finding is the limited perception of some stakeholders, e.g. customers or local communities. These might very well perceive the absolute amount of donations made by companies, but setting these donation amounts in relation to total firm resources seems to be beyond the means of the average customer. Following this line of thought, large amounts of charitable donations can cause large amounts of positive public attention and can hence generate a positive CFP impact on the same level as generosity in terms of relative donations. Finally, supporting the idea of an\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
