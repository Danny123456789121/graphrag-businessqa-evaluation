Finally, the paper allows a better understanding of obtaining different benefits of corporate sustainability through specific capabilities of the company, regarding the business strategy point of view.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, section 2 presents the research methodology. Section 3 presents a general overview on OCS literature. Section 4 presents the integrative framework that relates to OCS with CSB. Section 5 discusses the literature gaps and presents a research agenda. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusions, implications, limitations and directions for further research.\n\n# 2. Method\n\nThe SLR can be defined as a tool to identify, evaluate and interpret available and relevant studies regarding a particular research question (Kitchenham, 2004). The SLR steps adopted in this research are adapted from Tranfield et al. (2003): review planning, conducting the review, and reporting and dissemination (Fig. 1).\n\nThis Figure also describes the main objectives, methods, and tools adopted, as well as where the results were presented in the paper.\n\n# Step 1 - Review Planning\n\nTranfield et al. (2003) argue that it is necessary to carry out studies to evaluate the relevance of the subject to be researched, as well as to delimit the area of study. In this step, we sought to analyze in a preliminary and exploratory way forms by which OCS research topics are being approached by the literature. We searched Google Scholar for papers that studied OC related to sustainability. We noticed that a great number of authors studies these themes, although recently. In this step, we also analyze the main terms adopted by the articles to define the search terms (strings). In this way, an adherent search could be conducted to cover papers that approach the subject.\n\n# Step 2 - Conducting the Review\n\nThis step comprises stages for defining the portfolio. Tranfield et al. (2003) state that the search strategy should be reported in sufficient detail to ensure that it can be replicated. A search systematization begins with the identification of search strings drawn from the scope of the study and discussions with the group involved with the review (Tranfield et al., 2003).\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\n# Fig.1.

The WOS can be considered one of the most prestigious academic literature databases in the world (Wang and Waltman, 2015).\n\nThe first search, named \"search 1\", had as search strings terms related to capabilities and sustainability (and its synonyms) in order to not lose relevant content. The search was conducted by the “title” on WOS. “Search 1” was complemented by \"search 2\", which added other search terms considered relevant for the sustainability approach, such as “social performance” and “social responsibility”. We also performed this search by “title” on WOS. However, a low number of results were obtained. Therefore, we performed another search but replacing the search for \"title\" with \"topic\" in the terms related to sustainability. Fig. 2 summarizes these searches.\n\nThen, we began the selection of studies. For that, some analyses were performed as recommended by Ensslin et al. (2017) and Tranfield et al. (2003), aiming at alignment.\n\n# Journal Pre-proof\n\nwith the research topic. These analyses were conducted in titles, abstracts, free availability of full articles; and lastly, full alignment of the articles with the research topic. Fig. 2 shows the procedures adopted in all research steps, as well as the inclusion and exclusion criteria adopted.\n\n# Fig.2.
