It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions.

The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.\n\n# K E Y W O R D S\n\nartificial intelligence, ChatGPT, CSR, ethics, generative AI, HRM, human resource strategy, international human resource management, productivity, sustainability\n\n# Key points\n\n# What is currently known?\n\n- The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence models has swiftly prompted much academic and media discourse regarding\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAWAN BUDHWAR<|>PERSON<|>Pawan Budhwar is one of the contributors to the invited review on human resource management in the age of generative artificial intelligence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUMYADEB CHOWDHURY<|>PERSON<|>Soumyadeb Chowdhury is a contributor and the corresponding author of the invited review on human resource management in the age of generative artificial intelligence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEOFFREY WOOD<|>PERSON<|>Geoffrey Wood is a contributor to the invited review discussing the implications of generative artificial intelligence on human resource management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMAN AGUINIS<|>PERSON<|>Herman Aguinis is a contributor to the invited review on human resource management in the context of generative artificial intelligence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREG J.
