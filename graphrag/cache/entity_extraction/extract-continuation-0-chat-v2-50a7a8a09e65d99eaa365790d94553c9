The penalty for noncompliance is e40 per EUA not surrendered in Phase I and e100 in Phase II. The end of April is also the date when externally verified emissions are made public for each EU country. The EUAs can be traded in several trading platforms, notably the European Climate Exchange (ECX) in London, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Leipzig, and Nord Pool in Norway.\n\n# 4 Cash Flows, Expected Returns and the EU ETS\n\nIt is well known that changes in current stock returns reflect changes in future cash flows and changes in expected returns (e.g., Campbell and Shiller, 1988). This section discusses the effect of the EU ETS on firms' cash flows (the primary effect) and expected returns (the secondary effect).\n\n# 4.1 The Effect on Cash Flows\n\nWe begin with a discussion of how a cap-and-trade system with a free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant additional profits for carbon emitting firms. The first step in the mechanism is to recognize that a cap-and-trade system increases the marginal cost of production for the affected firms. The increase is equal to the market value of the EUAs required to produce one unit of output. Note that this is the case regardless of whether the EUAs are bought in the open market (an actual cost to the firm) or are received for free (an opportunity cost to the firm). In other words, for every unit of carbon allowances the firm uses, either it has to purchase this unit or it has to forego one unit from the surplus allowances it can sell.\n\nFollowing Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010), we use the simple demand and supply diagram in Figure 1 to illustrate the effect of carbon allowances on the profits of a perfectly competitive industry.2 In the absence of carbon regulation, the initial equilibrium price and quantity are given by p0 and X0 respectively. When we introduce a cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions with a free allocation of carbon allowances, the supply curve shifts up for two reasons: (i) the higher marginal cost due to the actual or opportunity cost of the\n\n2 The perfectly competitive firms are assumed to have constant emission rates (emissions per unit of output). See Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) for an analysis of imperfectly competitive firms with emission rates that depend on the level of output. Since the main intuition remains the same for perfect and imperfect competition, we focus on the case of perfect competition.\n\ncarbon allowances required per unit of output, denoted by r; and (ii) the higher marginal cost associated with a less carbon-intensive technology, denoted by c (fuel-switching costs). In the new equilibrium, production X1 is lower and the price pC consumers pay is higher exceeding the original marginal supply cost by c + r.\n\nIn this setup, the introduction of a cap-and-trade system with a free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant profits to carbon emitting firms. Specifically, the gain in producer surplus is represented by the shaded rectangular area A (or area pC aef), which is equal to r * X1. Note that, had the allowances been sold at auctions, area A would reflect the revenue to government. In the figure, area A appears much larger than the loss in producer surplus represented by the shaded trapezoidal area B (or area p0bdpS). If the difference of area A minus area B is positive, we can conclude that the free allocation of carbon allowances provides the firm with higher profits in the presence of carbon regulation. The size of areas A and B depends on the extent to which firms can shift to consumers the increase in marginal cost through higher output prices.\n\nIn summary, Figure 1 provides a simple but effective framework for showing the two direct effects on firm profits of the cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions. First, firms face higher marginal costs, which to a large extent are passed through to consumers through higher output prices, thus increasing firm revenue. Second, output falls and, since carbon allowances are allocated freely, the allowances not used in production can be sold for a profit. The combination of the two direct effects provides a mechanism that leads to substantial additional profits for carbon emitting firms.3\n\nIt is important to note that in the early stages of the EU ETS, there was considerable uncertainty regarding several aspects of its implementation. For example, as shown in the timeline in Table 1, the number of allowances given to each firm was made public in April 2006, which is more than two years after the EU ETS became law in November 2003. The price of the EUAs fluctuated considerably over time. There were other unknowns as well: the degree to which the opportunity cost of the allowances was incorporated into prices and the degree to which firms invested in alternative less carbon-intensive technologies. These examples indicate that, although the actual effect of the ETS on firm cash flows is expected to be positive, its exact magnitude was initially uncertain as information gradually became available.\n\n3 The graphical illustration of Figure 1 presents a static analysis. Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) also propose an intertemporal general equilibrium model that delivers similar results. For related theoretical studies of the effect of the EU ETS on firm profits see Sijm, Neuhoff and Chen (2006), Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward and Grubb (2006), and Demailly and Quirion (2009).\n\navailable over time. This is consistent with the insights of Pastor and Veronesi (2012), who study the effect of uncertainty about government policy on stock prices and identify impact uncertainty as the uncertainty about the impact of a new government policy on firms' profitability.\n\n# 4.2\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN CLIMATE EXCHANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Climate Exchange (ECX) is a trading platform located in London where EUAs can be traded.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU ENERGY EXCHANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is a trading platform located in Leipzig for trading EUAs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORD POOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nord Pool is a trading platform in Norway where EUAs can be traded.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU ETS<|>EVENT<|>The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions in the European Union.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUAs<|>EVENT<|>EU Allowances (EUAs) are permits that allow firms to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide under the EU ETS.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU ETS<|>EUROPEAN CLIMATE EXCHANGE<|>The European Climate Exchange is a platform where EUAs are traded as part of the EU ETS<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU ETS<|>EU ENERGY EXCHANGE<|>The European Energy Exchange is a platform where EUAs are traded as part of the EU ETS<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU ETS<|>NORD POOL<|>Nord Pool is a platform where EUAs are traded as part of the EU ETS<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUAs<|>EU ETS<|>EUAs are the permits that are traded under the EU ETS<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
