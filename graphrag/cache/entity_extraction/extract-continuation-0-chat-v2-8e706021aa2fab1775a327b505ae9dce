The\nhealth industry has a small demand elasticity, and therefore may provide a good hedge against\nnegative supply shocks. Services have few long-lived capital assets. Business Equipment may\nbenefit from adjustment due to temperature fluctuations as this increases demand for its product.\n\nTo test Hypothesis 2 formally with the industry portfolios, we create two equal-weighted\nportfolios. “High” includes the high-exposure sectors identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell\n(2014) (specifically: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; construction; mining; and\ntransportation and utilities; and manufacturing), while “Low” consists of the remaining sectors.\nThe loadings on the temperature shock factor for “High” and “Low” capture the average sensitivities of the\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nhigh-exposure and low-exposure sectors, respectively. Consequently, the loading on the temperature shock factor for “High – Low” picks up the sensitivity difference between the high- and low-exposure sectors. The time-series regressions for “High”, “Low” and “High – Low” are reported at the bottom of Panel A. The average loading on the temperature shock factor for the high-exposure sectors is -6.18 (t = -4.65), while that for the low-exposure sectors is -1.37 (t = -1.68). The sensitivity difference is -4.81 with a HAC-robust (Newey-West with 12 lags) t-statistic of -3.40. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is significantly supported for the 30 industry portfolios.\n\n# Size and value portfolios\n\nFor the size- and value-sorted portfolios the conjectures are that: (1) value firms, which tend to have long-lived capital assets, are more sensitive to the temperature shock factor than growth firms, and (2) smaller firms, which may have less resources to adapt or to adjust, are more sensitive to the temperature shock factor than larger firms. The results for the 25 size- and BM-sorted portfolios in Panel B of Table 4 are consistent with these conjectures. For instance, the temperature shock sensitivities of the small-value portfolio and the small-growth portfolio are, respectively, -27.15 and -6.73, suggesting that value firms are more sensitive to temperature shocks; similarly, the temperature shock loadings of the small-value portfolios and the large-value portfolio are, respectively, -27.15 and -12.77, implying that small firms are more vulnerable to temperature shocks.\n\nA more direct test, instead of obtaining loadings from the mimicking portfolio for temperature shocks – our primary specification of TSF from equation (4) – obtains loadings straight from the temperature shocks – alternative specification 3 (TSF* from equation 4c). As shown in the Web Appendix, the loadings of the sectors identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) a priori as having the highest exposure to weather, have (equal-weighted) average loading of -4.52 to the temperature shocks measured based on equation (4c) whereas the remaining sectors have only slightly negative loading on these temperature shocks of -0.17. The difference is -4.35, which is marginally insignificant (bootstrapping p-value of 0.11 in a one-tailed test). The support for Hypothesis 2 is weaker here due to higher standard errors. This occurs because the raw temperature shocks contain less focused information about economically relevant future weather implications than is captured by the mimicking temperature factor portfolios. The weaker results illustrate the advantage of using tracking portfolios rather than raw temperature shocks.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# 5.2. Impact on the cost of equity\n\nTo test Hypothesis 2 formally for the size and BM portfolios, we again form equal-weighted portfolios to capture the average sensitivities of different types of stocks. “Small” consists of the five small-capitalization portfolios, and “Big” includes the five large-capitalization portfolios; “Value” contains the five value portfolios, and “Growth” comprises the five growth portfolios. “Small - Big” picks up the difference between small and big stocks, and “Value - Growth” does the same for value and growth stocks.
