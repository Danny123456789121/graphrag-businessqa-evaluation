Results and Discussion\n\nThis research used multiple methods to develop a corporate sustainability framework that assists policymakers, government, decision-makers, and managers, to effectively develop sustainability and make better decisions in implementing sustainable business practices. This study is the first of its kind to develop a multidimensional corporate sustainability model based on important sustainability indicators that include pandemic information due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, this study identifies and assesses valuable sustainability options retrieved from literature and experts’ knowledge to provide the most suitable sustainability practices for making corporate sustainability resilient. Our investigation is a roadmap for organizations and policymakers in the contemporary world aiming to determine further applications based on our findings, which provides a more rational solution for the development of corporate sustainability.\n\n# 4.1. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process Results\n\nOur analysis started by using the FAHP method based on a pairwise comparison matrix. This matrix was built for determining individual expert scores through a geometric mean approach. The group-based decision-making approach was adopted for calculations of sustainability attributes and sub-attributes weights. Supported by experts and analyzing the related literature review, we can classify nine main sustainability attributes, i.e., Corporate Governance, Environment, Social, Economic, Product Responsibility, Natural Environment and Climate, Energy Consumption and Saving, Transparency and Communication, and COVID-19 pandemic. The first phase of the FAHP method comprises the calculation of the nine most important criteria’s weights and, at the second stage, we determined the 45 sub-attributes weights in total. Figure 6 presents the hierarchal structure of corporate sustainability with the main attributes and sub-attributes.\n\n# 4.2. Prioritizing Main Attributes\n\nThe FAHP computed the weight of each sustainability attribute in a hierarchical structure. The main attributes are presented in Table 5 and reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic is the most important criteria by obtaining the highest weight of 0.4129. The importance of criteria were as follows: Economic (0.3754), Corporate Governance (0.2532), Natural Environment and Climate (0.2195),\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nEnvironmental (ENV), Energy Consumption and Saving (0.1775), Transparency and Communication (0.1210), Social (0.0542), and Product Responsibility (0.0492) criteria, respectively. The details of each main sustainability indicator’s weights are presented in Table 5. The rapid spreading of the pandemic involving COVID-19 is the most influential barrier disrupting corporate sustainability. The pandemic has affected overall business performances. Economic sustainability and governance was the second most important indicator in our analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects, it brings new challenges for corporations to affect their ability to operationalize sustainability. In addition to new compliance and regulatory parameters, it appears to be a mandatory part of corporate sustainability in the organization. Therefore, corporations need to develop a corporate sustainability system in order to cope with these new issues and enable more sustainable business practices.\n\n# Table 5. Main corporate sustainability attributes.\n\n|Main Criteria|Code|Weight|Rank|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Pandemic|PEN|0.4129|1st|\n|Corporate Governance|CGOV|0.2532|3rd|\n|Product Responsibility|PR|0.0492|9th|\n|Transparency and Communication|TC|0.1210|7th|\n|Economic|EC|0.3754|2nd|\n|Environmental|ENV|0.1871|5th|\n|Social|SOC|0.0542|8th|\n|Natural Environment & Climate|NEC|0.2195|4th|\n|Energy Consumption and Saving|ECS|0.1775|6th|\n\nAccording to the calculation of the main sustainability attributes’ weights, the Pandemic attribute came first in the main corporate sustainability criteria. To this end, organizations should develop an emergency response plan to tackle any emergency, which may become a hurdle in the effective implementation of corporate sustainability. Hence, organizations should develop a sustainable structure that can prevent the organization from crises. Moreover, organizations should also implement suitable and long-lasting sustainability practices that assure optimal progress toward sustainability and provide benefits while utilizing scarce resources. Further, it was observed that the delivery time of goods supplies has been drastically disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, organizations need to develop a sustainable delivery system like just-in-time (JIT), which provides a more resilient solution during any emergency faced by the organization. Economic sustainability, governance, and natural environment and climate took their position after the pandemic attribute.
