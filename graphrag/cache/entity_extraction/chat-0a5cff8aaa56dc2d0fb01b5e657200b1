Most importantly, we empirically evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to perform sentiment scoring for firms in the context of policy implementation. Using generative AI to analyze firms’ public statements can give financial market participants valuable insights into their perceived risks to their external environments. Section 4 shows that sentiment scores predict firms’ stock returns and performance. This information can help investors understand uncertainty and make informed decisions. By exploring the ability of ChatGPT to transform unstructured data into a coherent and easily understandable format, we demonstrated the great potential of generative AI in improving the efficiency of financial markets. Simultaneously, we note several challenges and limitations associated with adopting generative AI in business and finance, such as data security and the lack of regulations to discipline applications in industry and academia. In this regard, it is crucial to be aware of technical limitations, develop relevant regulatory frameworks, and ensure that chatbot outputs are compliant. We note that governments, especially those of developing countries, should pay attention to relevant challenges for their employment and equality. On the other hand, it is crucial to maximize the potential of generative AI to enable financial services and products for underserved populations, thereby promoting financial inclusion.\n\nWe hope this study will inspire further research and innovation in the field of generative AI. To that end, we suggest several research questions for further study:\n\n1. Can generative AI improve performance in predicting stock prices, and do some generative AI tools perform better than others?\n2. Are measures of corporate culture or ESG scores produced by generative AI through textual analysis consistent with or even superior to existing measures?\n3. Can generative AI be used to detect discrimination, unfairness (e.g. gender or ethnic bias), or fraud in financial markets?\n4. Can generative AI capture companies’ attitudes towards social issues, such as climate change or the Black Lives Matter movement, and further explore the determinants or consequences of these attitudes?\n5. What guidance can scholars provide to help financial market regulators develop a legal framework for the emergence and development of generative AI?\n6. Given the opportunities and challenges of generative AI to developing countries, how can AI better support small businesses and households in these regions to promote inclusion and equality?\n7. Another aspect missing from recent theoretical modelling work is the international dimension of the AI revolution. This includes how AI triggers a new round of cross-border technological and economic competition through government investment strategies, how it affects the structure of international trade, and how it changes the global value chain. These issues offer economists a wide field for future discussion and research.\n---\n# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES\n\n# Notes\n\n1.

Bard is a generative AI chatbot based on PaLM2 developed by Google in response to the rise of the ChatGPT chatbot developed by OpenAI, initially launching in March 2023.\n4. The difference between ChtGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 is that the former is based on the GPT-3.5-turbo model, while the latter is based on the latest GPT-4 model. According to the official OpenAI website, the difference between GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 can be subtle in casual conversation. However, when the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold, the differences become apparent, since GPT-4 is more reliable and creative than GPT-3.5-turbo and is able to handle more nuanced instructions.\n5.
