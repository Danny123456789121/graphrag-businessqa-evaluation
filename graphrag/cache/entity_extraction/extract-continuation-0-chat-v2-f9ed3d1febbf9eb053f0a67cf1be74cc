This study employs TFNs, to construct the membership degree function. To find the converging point of the decision group, TFNs were solved using the geometric mean following previous studies such as [90,91]. In taking this approach, a FAHP methodology was used for computing the weights of the main and sub-attributes of corporate sustainability, supported by decision-makers, using a pairwise comparison matrix. To carry out the analysis, eight academic and industrial experts were involved whose detail is provided in Appendix A (see Table A1).\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\nfeedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.\n\n# Identification of main attributes\n\n# Finalization of attributes\n\n# Stage 1\n\nLiterature review\n\n# Categorization of major attributes\n\n# Categorization of sub-attributes within major attribute\n\n# Approve decision hierarchy?\n\n# Stage 2\n\nN\n\nFuzzy Delphi Method\n\nY\n\n# Assigning weights to attributes and sub-attributes\n\nN\n\n# Approve weights?\n\n# Stage 3\n\nY\n\nFuzzy AHP Method\n\n# Evaluation of attributes and sub-attributes\n\n# Determine the final ranks of attributes and sub-attributes\n\nFigure 3. The MCDA framework used in the study.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process\n\nThe Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a well-known and adaptable Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to solve complex problems used across a variety of fields of research. The logic of AHP is based on a ratio scale to quantify the different sets of alternatives priorities provided by decision-makers [92]. This approach evaluates the consistency and importance of the decision-makers’ instinctive opinions to provide an optimal solution for complex problems. Researchers have integrated the AHP approach with other methods, such as grey system theory, data analysis envelopment, fuzzy system theory, and even linear programming [93].\n\nAlthough AHP methods have shown satisfactory results and can be used to evaluate decision-makers’ opinions, this technique has some deficiencies in terms of human behavior and thinking approach. Hence, the traditional method has some limitations, such as (i) handling with the inconsistent and unbalanced expert opinion scale, (ii) unable to handle the uncertain and ambiguous relationship with expert’s judgment numbers, (iii) imprecise results, and (iv) decision-makers’ subjective opinion preferences.\n\nDue to these limitations, AHP has evolved into FAHP, as a widely used and more accurate approach over conventional methods to solve uncertain and complex problems involving a decision-maker’s judgment. FAHP is the combination of traditional AHP and Fuzzy set theory, where the membership of each element is represented by a function. Further, each element of the membership function is divided into the membership’s degree with a value between 0 and 1, which implies that any membership’s element has a value of “1”. Conversely, any element has no membership with a “0” value. Those elements which lie between “0 and 1” have a partial or incomplete degree of membership [94]. To effectively handle the uncertainties during the logistic estimation process, there is a need to convert the linguistic term of membership function into ‘fuzzy numbers’, meanwhile, in FAHP, linguistic values are shown as a TFN.\n\nTo develop corporate sustainability for the purposes of this study, FAHP was applied to estimate weights of criteria and sub-criteria in the six following steps:\n\n1. Designing the problem structure using a hierarchical approach\n2. Constructing of pairwise comparison matrix and developing the scale of the relative importance\n\nAfter designing the problem structure in a hierarchical way, the next step is to define the scale of relative importance in order to construct a pairwise comparison matrix. Table 3 presents the TFN, which are from 1 to 9, and are used to improve the accuracy of the traditional model. We employed (˜ 3, 5, 7, 9) relative to correspondence number for expert qualitative assessment in five TFNs in order to capture the vagueness and remove uncertainties. The fuzzy membership for attributes and sub-attributes is shown in Figure 4.\n\n|Linguistics Values|Triangular Fuzzy Numbers|Fuzzy Number|AHP Equivalent|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Extreme importance/preference|(7,9,11)|˜9|9|\n|Very strong importance/preference|(5,7,9)|˜7|7|\n|Strong importance/preference|(3,5,7)|˜5|5|\n|Moderate importance/preference|(1,3,5)|˜3|3|\n|Equal importance/preference|(1,1,3)|˜1|1|\n\n# Extreme importance/preference\n\n(7,9,11)\n\n# Very strong importance/preference\n\n(5,7,9)\n\n# Strong importance/preference\n\n(3,5,7)\n\n# Moderate importance/preference\n\n(1,3,5)\n\n# Equal importance/preference\n\n(1,1,3)\n\nWu(x)\n\n# Equal Moderate Strong Very strong Extreme\n\n# Intensity of importance\n\nFigure 4. Linguistic variables based on fuzzy membership function [95].\n\n# Step III. Constructing a fuzzy-based matrix for comparison purposes\n\nExperts used the TFNs to elaborate pairwise comparisons of corporate sustainability main and sub-attributes. The fuzzy comparison matrix X was drawn from the expert’s opinions by using the arithmetic mean function for pairwise comparison, as presented in Equation (1).\n\n|∼|…|b1n|\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2019<|>EVENT<|>A publication discussing various aspects of sustainability in the year 2019, including methodologies and frameworks for analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>EVENT<|>A publication discussing various aspects of sustainability in the year 2020, focusing on fuzzy analytical hierarchy processes and decision-making methodologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAHP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process is a decision-making methodology that combines traditional AHP with fuzzy set theory to handle uncertainties in expert judgments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AHP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Analytical Hierarchy Process is a multi-criteria decision analysis approach used to solve complex problems by quantifying alternatives based on expert opinions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIANGULAR FUZZY NUMBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of fuzzy number used in decision-making processes to represent uncertain information in a triangular shape.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEOMETRIC MEAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mathematical method used to find the average of a set of numbers, particularly in the context of fuzzy numbers and decision-making.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals involved in the decision-making process, providing their opinions and judgments to evaluate various attributes and criteria.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2019<|>FAHP<|>The publication from 2019 discusses methodologies that include the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process for decision-making in sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY 2020<|>FAHP<|>The publication from 2020 elaborates on the use of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process in evaluating sustainability attributes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAHP<|>AHP<|>FAHP is an evolution of AHP that incorporates fuzzy set theory to improve decision-making under uncertainty<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAHP<|>TRIANGULAR FUZZY NUMBER<|>FAHP utilizes Triangular Fuzzy Numbers to represent expert opinions in a structured manner<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAHP<|>GEOMETRIC MEAN<|>FAHP employs the geometric mean to aggregate expert judgments in the decision-making process<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION-MAKERS<|>FAHP<|>Decision-makers provide their opinions and judgments that are essential for the application of FAHP in sustainability evaluations<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
