Moreover, corporate practitioners are increasingly faced with external pressures from different stakeholders to behave responsibly toward the natural environment (Flammer 2013). According to the latest global survey of CEOs provided by Accenture and UN Global Compact (UNGC), 93 % of the 1000 surveyed CEOs believe that sustainability will be important or “very important” to the future success of their business (UNGC and Accenture 2013).\n\nWhile research rooted in neoclassical economics proposed that any discretionary efforts toward improvements of CEP would decrease profits and thus violate shareholder value maximization (e.g., Friedman 1970; Jensen 2002); other scholars have challenged this view by putting\n\n# J. Endrikat\n\nforward arguments for a positive impact of CEP on CFP. In particular, stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Parmar et al. 2010) and the natural resource-based view (NRBV; e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provided the theoretical grounds for postulating a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, empirical examinations have long yielded mixed results, ranging from findings indicating a negative relationship (e.g., Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011), to non-significant findings (e.g., Cohen et al. 1997; Graves and Waddock 1999), up to findings suggesting a positive relationship between both focal constructs (e.g., Flammer 2013; Russo and Fouts 1997).\n\nDue to the substantial body of empirical work concerned with the CEP–CFP link, scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. Three meta-analyses have recently addressed the relationship between CEP and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014).1 In essence, the meta-analytic results suggest a modest positive relationship which, however, appears to be quite complex and subject to several moderation effects arising for example from different measurement approaches, causal ambiguity, and methodological issues (Endrikat et al., 2014). Broadly, empirical research has used three different types of methodologies for examining the CEP–CFP relationship: (1) portfolio analyses comparing the financial performance of model portfolios of firms with high CEP and low CEP, (2) multivariate analyses using multiple regression approaches or structural equation models, and (3) event studies assessing the stock market impact of positive or negative corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events) (de Haan et al. 2012; Salzmann et al. 2005). The event study methodology appears particularly appropriate for examining the CEP–CFP relationship due to several reasons; for example, by focusing on stock market returns, event studies imply a forward-looking perspective on the financial consequences of CEP. Moreover, event studies evade the issue of endogeneity and are quite unambiguous with regard to the causal direction of the relationship. However, while the results of studies based on portfolio analyses and multivariate analyses have been captured by the above-mentioned meta-analyses, thus far no attempt has been made towards an integration and consolidation of the empirical evidence provided by event studies.\n\n1 In addition, there are several meta-analyses regarding the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP (e.g., Allouche and Laroche 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). As CEP can be considered a dimension or a component of the broader construct of CSP (e.g., Busch and Hoffmann 2011; Orlitzky et al. 2003), the CSP–CFP meta-analyses partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis.\n\nIn an effort to remedy this deficiency, this paper provides a meta-analysis that accumulates 53 effect sizes derived from 32 studies concerned with stock market reactions to CEP-related events. Meta-analysis, a tool for quantitatively synthesizing the findings across a number of studies, has become increasingly common in management research (Combs et al. 2011; Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012). Particularly in cases where inconsistent findings impede any generalizations, it has become the methodology of choice for establishing consensus (Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012).\n\nThe current study makes three contributions. First, it contributes to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by complementing the existing CEP–CFP meta-analyses and thus completing the body of cumulative evidence regarding the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, given the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytically derived significant population effect would provide a rather clear indication of an impact of CEP on CFP ruling out potential reverse causality. This is of particular importance because the direction of causality (i.e., whether causation runs from CEP to CFP or vice versa) still represents a disputed issue (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Molina-Azorín et al. 2009; Nakao et al. 2007). Second, picking up anecdotal evidence, which suggests stronger market reactions to negative events compared with positive ones, this work offers theoretical reasoning for this phenomenon and incorporates this issue in the meta-analytic investigation. Finally, by conducting exploratory moderator analyses (Geyskens et al\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACCENTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Accenture is a global professional services company that provides consulting services and is involved in the latest global survey of CEOs regarding sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN GLOBAL COMPACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UN Global Compact is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
