Conclusions\n\nAllocation of environmental costs in green accounting through the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) is one of the strategic policies for manufacturing companies in Indonesia, so that it can improve financial performance, because it is related to company policies in allocating costs to environmental activities, investment, and funding. Therefore, the company’s decision to allocate environmental costs must be in line with consumer needs and consider the company’s capabilities.\n\nThe results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country, are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs and in accordance with their portion so as to improve financial performance either directly or indirectly. The public assesses that companies that have a good ranking in the company performance rating program in environmental management by the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment have good prospects for financial performance.\n\nManufacturing companies in Indonesia, whose production process is directly related to the environment and based on the results of research that the public highly assesses companies from the perspective of their environmental responsibility, can hope to continue to maintain and improve the planning and allocation of environmental costs in the production process. The government, in this case the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI), should make accounting policies and standards related to green accounting the company’s legal basis for accounting. This study only examined manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Future researchers should try to use other sector companies, so they can find out whether environmental issues can occur in all types of businesses.\n\n# References\n\nAli, Q., Salman, A., Yaacob, H., Zaini, Z., & Abdullah, R.
