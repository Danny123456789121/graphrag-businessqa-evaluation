Refining benchmark model.\n\nSome authors use a single-index model as a return-generating process to compute excess returns (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005), while others use multi-factor models (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994; Gregory et al., 1997). The negative sign on the Index variable in Tables 10 and 11 suggests that the AESs calculated using multi-factor models are smaller than those calculated using a single-index model, consistent with Hypothesis 10. Since multi-index models control for more dimensions of corporate characteristics than single-index models, a spurious difference in performances between SRI and conventional portfolios tends to be smaller than in the case of using a single-index model.\n\nIn practice, fund managers change their portfolio holdings if macroeconomic conditions change, resulting in dynamic riskâ€“return profiles. In this case, conditional models are more appropriate for handling dynamic return-generating.\n\nÂ© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# 5.3.3. Matching.\n\nMatching procedures will eliminate the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance caused by confounding factors and induce AESs to be smaller. Consistent with this argument postulated in Hypothesis 11, Tables 10 and 11 show that the coefficient of matching dummy has a significantly negative sign. In addition, the negative sign of the Match_N variable suggests that possible bias caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in one-to-one matching can be minimized by matching multiple counterparts, leading to a reduction in unwarranted differences between SRI and conventional portfolios.\n\n# 6. Conclusions and Discussions\n\nThis article investigated the impact of SRI on investment performance in the US, using a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis makes a comparison across diverse studies possible by computing ES that is a standardized measure of impact derived from treatment and control groups.\n\nThe empirical results show that the weighted average ES is not different from zero. It is an important finding for investors since they do not have to be concerned with the possibility of sacrificing returns when they pursue investment strategies that are socially responsible.\n\nWe establish various moderators and run meta-regressions in order to examine whether ESs and AESs change systematically depending on research characteristics. For this, we split moderators into two groups, one related to sampling issues and the other related to methodological issues. To begin with, we find that ESs are positive in the earlier period and have become smaller in terms of absolute value with alternating signs as time passes. When the idea of SRI was relatively new, investors seemed to be able to earn excess returns by incorporating SRI elements in their portfolio. However, the excess return opportunity may have decreased over time and researchers seem to find a smaller impact of SRI since spurious differences between SRI and conventional investment performances are eliminated by the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
