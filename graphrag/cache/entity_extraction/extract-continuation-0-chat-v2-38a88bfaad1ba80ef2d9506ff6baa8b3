The expected return for individual stock i can be determined first by regressing its returns against the return of a market portfolio (e.g., the S&P 500) and calculating the slope (beta) and vertical intercept (αi) of that function. Then, given the return of the market portfolio on any given day (Rmt), the expected return for a stock can be calculated according to the market model:\n\nE(i) = αi + βiRmt\n\nwhere βi = the beta for security i (a constant), and Rmt = the actual return for the market portfolio (e.g., S&P 500) in time period t.\n\n# Average Abnormal Returns (AARs)\n\nThe key to event study methodology is that it examines not just one action but rather many actions simultaneously. Put another way, an event study on automobile recalls would not look at only one recall made by Chrysler Corporation in August 1986, for instance, but rather at all recalls made by Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors between 1980 and 1989, for example. Thus, an average abnormal return could be calculated as:\n\nAARt = (ΣARi) / n,\n\nwhere AAR = the average abnormal return in time period t for all the events involved, and n = the number of events in the study. Standard hypothesis testing is used on the average abnormal returns for each day in the event window. If the market reacts specially to events, then the average abnormal return will be significantly different from zero. Finally, it should be noted here that 11 studies used a variation of this standard methodology and ended up computing cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs): This methodology is explained in detail in Dodd and Warner (1983).\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\n# NOTES\n\n1. The logic of my argument is as follows:\n\nFirst the statements:\n\n1. A: Firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner:\n2. B: Shareholder wealth is increased.\n\nEnlightened self-interest theorists argue:\n\n1. A 5 B (i.e., if firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner; then shareholder wealth is increased.)\n\nWe have no data to substantiate (3) but argue that we can show A is a necessary condition for B, that is:\n\n1. B > A (i.e., if shareholder wealth is increased, then firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner.)\n\nThe contrapositive of (4) that is, a logical equivalent of (4) is:\n\n1. ~A → ~B (i.e., if firms did not act in a socially responsible and lawful manner; then shareholder wealth is not increased)\n\nWe focus our attention on this proposition because of the nature of the data, which are data on the effects of socially irresponsible behavior on shareholder wealth.\n\n2. Event studies presume that the market finds out about the irresponsible behavior; it is possible that some firms engaging in illegal or irresponsible behavior succeed in concealing that behavior and would thus never become the subject of an event study.
