The results of all robustness tests are available in an online appendix. In sum, we conclude that our results are largely robust against a number of issues that.\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nAfter reviewing almost half a century of empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship, we have developed hypotheses on the causally most relevant empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to positively affect CFP. We subsequently used MASEM to test these hypotheses on the accumulated empirical evidence. As such, we aim to make several contributions to the literature.\n\nFirst, our study offers a new synthesis of the available evidence that includes the last two decades of CSR-CFP research. In the fifteen years since the publication of the last two meta-analyses on the relationship between CSR and CFP (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003), the field of empirical CSR research has grown significantly as evidenced by the fact that our analysis counts no less than 224 new papers. During this period, the focus has shifted from empirically assessing the CSR-CFP relationship as a whole to examining the more concrete empirical mechanisms underlying it. Given this development, an up to date assessment of the accumulated empirical evidence is timely and useful. Next to identifying and testing four key mechanisms through which CSR activities affect CFP, our meta-analysis also found that these mechanisms do not fully mediate the CSR-CFP relationship. This implies that there is still room for future research to identify empirical mechanisms causally connecting CSR with CFP that have gone unobserved to date. We return to this below.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nA second contribution of our study is that we respond to calls for more conceptual clarification of CSR (Gond & Crane, 2010; Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008; Rowley & Berman, 2000). By focusing on the empirical relationship that has received most scholarly attention to date (Margolis & Walsh, 2003), we were able to distinguish and conceptually carve out Strategic CSR from CSR more generally, and provide a definition of Strategic CSR that is both intensionally and extensionally explicit (Van Oosterhout, 2005). Specifically, we define Strategic CSR as those firm activities that appear to further some social good, while at the same time benefitting the firm financially by either enhancing its reputation, increasing stakeholder reciprocation, mitigating firm-specific risk, and/or improving innovation.\n\nWith this evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR, we address an important conceptual problem that has burdened much of the CSR literature to date. By positioning a firm’s economic responsibilities as one of a larger set of social responsibilities that comprise CSR (Carroll, 1979), a central critique of the CSR concept has always been that it confounds two fundamentally conflicting views: that of positive economics and normative ethics (Gond & Crane, 2010; Jones, 1983; Swanson, 1995; Windsor, 2006). Some scholars have indeed argued that CSR is a normative concept (Matten et al., 2003) that has little positive explanatory value (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). In this study, we have conceptually developed the Strategic CSR concept that can be used for positive research in strategic management, however. This concept only bears on CSR activities that enhance CFP, making Strategic CSR a purely instrumental form of CSR. By excluding those CSR activities that may be good for society but not for the firm, we have sought to conceptually separate some of CSR’s main positive explanatory features from the normative beliefs as to what CSR ought to comprise. By disentangling the normative and positive features of CSR in this way, we hope to provide some relief to a field that has consistently confused normative and positive.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n# Discussion\n\nOn what Strategic CSR is, is now completed, nor that all issues on what CSR should be taken to mean more generally have now been resolved. With respect to the former, the development of a conceptualization of Strategic CSR does not mean that it should be clear that future empirical research may still lead to further evidence-based adjustments of the Strategic CSR concept, as would be true in general for all causal approaches to explanatory concept formation. With respect to the latter, our study has conceptually clarified Strategic CSR by carving it out of the domain denoted by CSR more generally, but only at the price of leaving that domain as conceptually opaque as it was (claimed to be) before. Both observations may help to guide future research on CSR.\n\n# Limitations and Future Research\n\nA third contribution of this study, therefore, is that its findings and limitations offer guidance to future research. A salient finding of our study is that the four mechanisms combined explain only 20 percent of the CSR-CFP relationship. These mechanisms therefore do not fully mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP, suggesting that our conceptualization of Strategic CSR does not yet fully account for the mechanisms connecting CSR to CFP. One explanation for this may be that research to date has not yet captured the full breadth and depth of each of the four mechanisms identified. With respect to stakeholder reciprocation, for example, we found studies on employee, government, customer, and shareholder reciprocation, but hardly any studies on community reciprocation (but see: Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017), and none on supplier reciprocation. Similarly, the benefits of stakeholder reciprocation may become manifest in different guises, including retention, word of mouth, and commitment, which all require further empirical measurement.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
