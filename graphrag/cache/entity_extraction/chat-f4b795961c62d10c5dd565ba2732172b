The meta-analytic correlations indicate that the association between CSR and CFP depends on the researcher’s operational definition of each construct. Overall, the findings with respect to CSR operationalizations suggest that the relationship measured by surveys produces the strongest effect compared with the other four types of CSR measurements. Meanwhile, content analysis appears to have an insignificant impact on CFP. Market-based measures of CFP were less highly correlated.\n\n# Business & Society\n\nwith CSR than accounting and perceptual measures. In that sense, two theoretical implications are noteworthy. On one hand, CSR is a multidimensional construct, which has yet to contribute a few pieces of puzzle in its definition and measurement among previous studies. As discussed above, many measures have been used in empirical research on CSR. The great disparity of CSR measures has made it very difficult for research to cumulate. As Wood and Jones (1995) pointed out,\n\nmeasures are developed for certain purposes—say, to test for a statistical link between corporate social responsibility and financial performance such as ROI—and they may not be readily transferrable to other purposes, such as the development of a general theory of corporate social performance. (p. 240)\n\nThe meta-analytic result of high correlation between CFP and CSR measured by survey is consistent with Wood and Jones’s point. However, some scholars have begun to move toward a new theory of the firm—a stakeholder theory—that would permit a better understanding of CSR. According to Freeman (1984), the main founder of stakeholder theory, stakeholder indicates groups and organizations that are affected by or can affect a company’s operations. Stakeholders are not unitary, which serve a single function for a firm; rather, they engage in many different behaviors with respect to the firm, while filling several critical roles. Within a stakeholder-based theoretical perspective, CSR is a way for firms to engage more fully in their societal relationships and duties (Wood & Jones, 1995). The insignificant integrated results based on content analysis, in this meta-analysis, also show that a comprehensive and complex framework is essential to evaluate CSR. Therefore, the authors suggest that stakeholder theory is the most relevant theoretical framework for assessing corporate social performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the meta-analytic outcomes support the view that differences in previous studies resulted from “stakeholder mismatching.” As Wood and Jones (1995) argued, different stakeholders might differently set expectations, experience the effects, and evaluate the outcomes for a particular measure of corporate performance. Multiple stakeholders can be involved in different ways in a single instance of firm behavior. Hence, the ambiguous results are largely due to studies not choosing variables and predicting relationships that would be appropriate within a stakeholder/CSR framework. The meta-analysis supports the Orlitzky et al. (2003) suggestion that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioral measures of CSR, because there is no theory to explain why stockholders would buy a company’s stock for its high-level donation.\n\n# Wang et al.\n\nMoreover, incorporating multiple moderators allows for a comprehensive understanding of the contextual contingencies between CSR and CFP. In recent studies, scholars have argued that socially responsible corporate behavior varied across countries and appealed for more attention to a cross-national comparison (Campbell, 2007). But for the shortage of multinational data, the comparative research based on different background is still rare. However, meta-analysis can overcome this issue to a certain extent by integrating empirical results across diverse contexts. More specifically, by including market development and institutional environment as a contextual moderator, the authors found the relationship between CSR and CFP to vary significantly within different operational environments. This finding provides insight for cross-cultural research and practical implication for multinational firms.\n\nFuture studies should explore the macro-level and societal factors that may moderate this relationship. Macro-level variables, such as the munificence of natural resources, relative wealth, and the type of government and its stability, help vary the CSR–CFP link. Societal moderators, such as religion, historic traditions, and moral culture, also influence this relationship (Robertson & Crittenden, 2003). This meta-analysis result also provided some strategic implications for multinational firms. Corporate managers are mindful of the fact that business norms and standards, regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder demands for CSR can vary substantially across nations and regions (McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). If multinational firms fail to concern about local ethical norms pursued by cross-cultural alliance partners, distributors, suppliers, customers, financiers, and foreign government agencies, they may come across public relations disasters.\n\nThe present study is also subject to a number of limitations. First, although the authors have conducted a file drawer analysis to examine the publication bias, the authors could not perfectly solve this problem. Among the 42 studies, most are from journals, and only 1 is a doctoral dissertation. The authors have done their best to search for studies with a wide range of resources, but the file drawer problem is still a key shortcoming of a meta-analysis. Second, as previous research mentioned, the relationship between CSR and CFP varies significantly with the different characteristics of firms and their operational environments (H. Wang & Qian, 2011). In this study, the authors have investigated the moderating effects of measurement strategies and environmental factors. But, for the shortage of relative data, firm-level moderators and other potential moderators, which might explain the variance across studies, have not been identified and examined, warranting further research in the future.\n\n# Business & Society\n\n# Conclusion\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
