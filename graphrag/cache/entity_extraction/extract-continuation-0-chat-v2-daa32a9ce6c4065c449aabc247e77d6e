Alternatively, accounting-based indicators, such as the firm’s return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), or earnings per share (EPS), capture a firm’s internal efficiency in some way (Cochran and Wood 1984). Accounting returns are subject to managers’ discretionary allocations of funds to different projects and policy choices, and thus reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external market responses to organizational (non-market) actions. Lastly, perceptual measures of CFP ask survey respondents to provide subjective estimates of, for instance, the firm’s ‘soundness of financial position’, ‘wise use of corporate assets’, or ‘financial goal achievement relative to competitors’ (Conine and Madden 1987; Reimann 1975; Wartick 1988).\n\nThe construct of CSP is associated with the following four broad measurement strategies: (a) CSP disclosures; (b) CSP reputation ratings; (c) social audits, CSP processes, and observable outcomes; and (d) managerial CSP principles and values (Post 1991). First, CSP disclosure measurement consists of content analysis of annual reports, letters to shareholders, 10Ks, and a number of other corporate disclosures to the public as surrogates of CSP. Content analysis is employed to compare units of text against particular CSP themes in order to draw inferences about the organization’s underlying social performance (Wolfe 1991).\n\nA second approach to measuring CSP is the use of reputational indices, such as Moskowitz’s (1972, 1975) tripartite ratings (‘outstanding’, ‘honourable mention’, and ‘worst’ companies; for example, Cochran and Wood 1984; Sturdivant and Ginter 1977) or Fortune magazine ratings of a corporation’s ‘responsibility to the community and environment’ (for example, Conine and Madden 1987; Fombrun and Shanley 1990; McGuire et al. 1988). Other researchers (Alexander and Buchholz 1978; Heinze 1976; Vance 1975) have developed their own reputational measures by surveying business professionals and business students. Reputation indices are based on the assumption that CSP reputations are good reflections of underlying CSP values and behaviours.\n\nSocial audits and concrete observable CSP processes and outcomes are the third broad measurement category of CSP. Social audits consist of a systematic third-party effort to assess a firm’s ‘objective’ CSP behaviours, such as community service, environmental programmes, and corporate philanthropy. Objective data are the foundation for so-called ‘behavioural’ measures of CSP. However, behavioural measures based on social audits may still result in a ranking, such as the measure provided by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP). Various studies have used the CEP social audit rankings of companies’ pollution records (for example, Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Fogler and Nutt 1975; Spicer 1978; see also the overview of studies in Appendix A). Although this subset of studies differs from the other three subsets, it is still very broad. Therefore, this third group will be broken down further to examine the instrumental effectiveness of processes of social responsiveness.\n\nDownloaded from oss.sagepub.com at Universitats-Landesbibliothek on December 2, 2013\n\n# 409\n\n# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance\n\nThe fourth measurement category of CSP assesses the values and principles inherent in a company’s culture. Aupperle (1984) developed a forced-choice survey of corporate social orientations, drawing on Carroll’s (1979) corporate social responsibility construct with its four dimensions of economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities. The last three elements comprise the construct ‘concern for society’. Volume 12 of Research in Corporate Social Performance and Policy (Post 1991: Part III, 265–401) reviews in greater depth the history and psychometric properties of the different CSP measures briefly delineated here (Aupperle 1991; Carroll 1991; Clarkson 1991; Gephardt 1991; Wokutch and McKinney 1991; Wolfe 1991; Wolfe and Aupperle 1991).\n\nDifferences in CSP–CFP statistical associations across these four measurement subsets may result from three sources. First, there might be ‘real’ (substantive) cross-study variation in correlations between CSP and CFP, as predicted by Wood and Jones’s (1995) mismatching thesis. Wood and Jones (1995) argued that effects would vary depending on expectations and evaluations of CSP, which differ from one stakeholder group to another. No positive correlations would be expected between measures that cannot be linked theoretically, such as CSP disclosures and accounting-based efficiency measures of CFP. For example, Wood and Jones’s (1995) review suggested that the match between market measures and market-oriented stakeholders (for example, customers) would produce significant positive results, while the correlation between market measures and charitable contributions, for instance, would not.\n\nAlternatively, differences in correlations across variable measurement subsets may simply be a function of statistical artefacts. For example, if one measurement subgroup were found to contain many studies with very small sample sizes, this subgroup would show a relatively large random sampling error. Thus, differences in sampling error across measurement\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COCHRAN<|>PERSON<|>Cochran is a researcher who discusses the importance of shareholders as a primary stakeholder group in determining a company's fate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORGANIZATION STUDIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization Studies is a journal that publishes research related to organizational behavior and performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Performance (CSP) is a construct associated with measuring a company's social performance through various strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) refers to the financial outcomes of a company's operations and its efficiency measures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUPPERLE<|>PERSON<|>Aupperle is a researcher who developed a survey of corporate social orientations based on Carroll's corporate social responsibility construct.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCHRAN<|>ORGANIZATION STUDIES<|>Cochran's research is published in Organization Studies, which focuses on organizational behavior and performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>CFP<|>CSP and CFP are related constructs that assess a company's social and financial performance respectively<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUPPERLE<|>CSP<|>Aupperle's work contributes to the understanding of Corporate Social Performance (CSP) through his survey on corporate social orientations<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
