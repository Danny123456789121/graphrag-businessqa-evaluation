This would then update and advance the knowledge beyond what Orlitzky et al. (2003) covered in their studies for the period 1974-1999. We would also be keen to study the effect of national culture on effect size. The current studies are exclusively based in the USA, and there has been considerable work in the past few years in the context of other countries or regions including Australia, Japan (Okamoto, 2009), Taiwan (Shen and Chang, 2009), China (Wang and Juslin, 2009) and Spain (Sanchez and Sotorrio, 2007). These studies should also be included in future research in order to develop a universal framework for understanding the link between CSR and CFP.\n\n# 8. Limitations and future research\n\nThis paper has some limitations that should be noted. Firstly, industry has not been included as a factor in the meta-analysis. Future research should aim to examine the possible impact of this factor on CFP. Secondly, we have confined our meta-analysis to the papers included in Orlitzky et al. (2003) before 1999. Future research can update this time frame beyond 1999. Thirdly, it has been assumed that the year of publication is closely related to the year(s) in which the study data was collected. In the worst case, the study data will lag a few years behind the publication date, which will reduce the impact of time on the relationship between CSR and CFP. Future research can take account of this lag or avoid it by using study data dates as a factor. Fourthly, typologies of ways of measuring CSR and CFP would greatly assist future research in this area. Such a typology would allow researchers to connect CSR to various types of financial performance, for example ROI, ROA, ROE and the price/earnings ratio.\n\nFuture research can also link the measurement of firms’ commitment to CSR using the triple bottom line as the theoretical underpinning (Elkington, 1997). The three bottom lines are the social, economic and environmental obligations of corporations. Next, the relationship between sustainability and CSR commitment of firms can also be explored in future research that links these two to CFP.\n\nFinally, we strongly suggest that future researchers should consider a wider variety of statistical methodologies when studying the effect of CSR on CFP. Only two papers out of 34 employed methods other than the very traditional t-tests and regression. Whilst it is perfectly sensible to use a t-test or regression when the data and research questions call for them, our results do show that methodology has a significant effect on effect size. Therefore, we propose that the use of a wider range of methodologies may help answer important questions about the relationship between CSR and CFP.\n\n# 9. Conclusion\n\nTo summarise, we carried out a sub-group meta-analysis of studies investigating the extent of the relationship between CSR and CFP. While individual studies have found a relationship that varies from strongly positive to strongly negative, a meta-analysis conducted by Orlitzky et al. (2003) found that the overall effect was moderately positive. Our re-analysis by sub-groups according to sample size, year of publication and methodology shows that the effect of time is not a significant factor in determining the effect size. However, sample size and statistical technique play an important role in determining the link between CSR and CFP. By combining these two factors, we can conclude that research methodology can be singled out as the major source of variation in the strength of the relationship between CSR and CFP.\n\nIdentifying this major source of variation in the measurement of links between CSR and CFP will contribute to the refinement of the measurement process in further research. More specifically, this sub-group meta-analysis can be considered as an advancement over the previous meta analysis in that our analysis identified more specific contributing factors towards resolving the controversy regarding the acceptance of CSR as a viable business choice. This research will also contribute to future modelling of the effect of CSR on CFP. New important variables have been identified, and others gathered together from existing literature as a guide to future modelling processes.\n\n# References\n\nAupperle, K.E., Carroll, A.B. and Hatfield, J.D.
