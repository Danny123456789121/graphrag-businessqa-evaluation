Summing up, these arguments bring us to the following hypothesis:\n\n# H3c: Accounting-based CFP demonstrates a stronger relation to CSP than growth-, risk-, and market-based CFP.\n\n# Mutual Funds\n\nSeveral studies on mutual funds, financial indices, and virtual portfolios suggest that the positive CSP-CFP relation is weaker compared to studies using firm-specific CFP measures. To date, this result presents a puzzling outcome in CSP-CFP research. The first mutual funds studies appeared in the early 1990s. The initial findings of these early studies discovered that the performance of CSP-oriented mutual funds is not statistically different from the performance of conventional mutual funds (e.g. Hamilton, Jo, & Statman, 1993). However, ever since then, further investigations have been carried out in several primary and review studies (Bauer, Koedijk, & Otten, 2005; Capelle-Blancard & Monjon, 2014; Rathner, 2013; Revelli & Viviani, 2015), hardening the conclusion that the CSP-CFP link is weaker for mutual funds as compared to other CSP-CFP studies. In turn, we hypothesize:\n\n# H3d: Studies on mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to studies using other CFP measures.\n\n# Moderating Factors\n\nThe literature discusses a range of conditions under which CSP and CFP influence each other (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). In addition to the most common factors – company size and the type of industry.\n\n© 2018 The Authors. Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nCorp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 2018\n\nDOI: 10.1002/csr\n\nT. Busch and G. Friede\n\n(Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Buehler & Shetty, 1974; Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky, 2008) – several other moderating factors have been used in primary studies. These are visibility to the public and consumers (Fry, Keim, & Meiners, 1982; Jiang & Bansal, 2003), research and development investments (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000), economic conditions (Golicic & Smith, 2013), the level of diversification, advertising, government sales, consumer income, and stage in the industry as well as the firm life cycle (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Elsayed & Paton, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Since not all primary studies use the same bundle of control variables and/or moderating factors, it is difficult to compare such effects in meta-analyses. Thus, as meta-analysts have not adjusted for these factors in a comparable manner, we also cannot investigate these effects. Nonetheless, a few central moderating factors can be assessed at second-order level.\n\n# Effects over Time\n\nIt is not unusual that academic studies investigating a specific effect for the first time demonstrate impressive effect sizes which partly diminish in subsequent research studies (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Griffin and Mahon (1997) have already called for research that looks at the CSP-CFP relation over time. To date, it is still an open question as to whether this is a time-independent relation. Scholars suggest that institutional investors increasingly focus on stakeholder issues (Borgers et al., 2013; Derwall et al., 2011). On account of learning effects and changes in investor values, these issues came into focus in recent years and subsequently the CSP-CFP relation – in this case measured as market-based CFP – diminished considerably since the mid-2000s. However, in meta-research on the CSP-CFP link, the evidence of a time dependency is not consistent. In their meta-analysis, Pavie and Filho (2008) show considerable effect size differences before and after 1998. Some discover no or only non-significant relations (Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Rubera & Kirca, 2012). Based on suggestions from primary studies and meta-analyses, we hypothesize about the moderating role of time:\n\nH4a: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks over time.\n\n# Sample Size\n\nHedges (1981) demonstrates that effect sizes for small samples are biased upward. Evidence from cumulative meta-analyses in different fields supports this finding and cautions that meta-analyses with a small number of subjects may overestimate effects (Ioannidis, Trikalinos, Ntzani, & Contopoulos-Ioannidis, 2003; Trikalinos et al., 2004). By using the number of included studies as a weighting factor, the calculation design of meta-analyses seeks to adjust for this circumstance. If the CSP-CFP relation was a statistical outlier, we would observe effect size differences depending on the study sample size. Initial observations of our sample based on the number of included primary studies in a meta-analysis and the corresponding meta-study overall effect size support such a conclusion. We therefore hypothesize:\n\nH4b: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks with the growing number of primary studies in the meta-sample.\n\n# The Role of the Studies’ Publishing Source\n\nOrlitzky (2011) examines in a review of the 2003 data whether the empirical evidence on the CSP-CFP relation differs depending on the kind of publishing journal. The author finds that the average correlations in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. focusing on corporate social responsibility and environmental management issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T.
