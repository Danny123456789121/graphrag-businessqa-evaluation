This is consistent with the insights of Pastor and Veronesi (2012), who study the effect of uncertainty about government policy on stock prices and identify impact uncertainty as the uncertainty about the impact of a new government policy on firms' profitability.\n\n# 4.2 The Effect on Expected Returns\n\nIn addition to the primary effect of the free allocation of carbon allowances, there is a secondary effect based on \"carbon risk\". In particular, firms that require carbon allowances are subject to carbon risk due to uncertainty about the future price for the allowances, which also generates uncertainty about future cash flows. For example, the EUA price has fluctuated considerably over time and will likely continue to remain volatile in the future. This can have an effect on future cash flows.\n\nFurthermore, an institutional change in the EU ETS, such as a change in the law that initially gives carbon allowances for free but subsequently makes them available in auctions has a profound effect on the market's expectation of future cash flows.\n\nFinally, recent contributions by Weitzman (2009), Litterman (2013) and Pindyck (2013) suggest that carbon emitting firms are exposed to carbon risk because they might face a higher price for carbon allowances in the future as a result of catastrophic climate change. This is because the price of carbon allowances reflects the present value of damages from emitting one tonne of CO2, which is often referred to as the social cost of carbon.4 According to Litterman (2013), carbon risk is non-diversifiable and hence will command a risk premium determined by societal risk aversion. It is true that assessing the social cost of carbon is difficult because there is great uncertainty today about: the size of future economic damages related to climate change; the probability with which they may occur; the timing of when they may occur; and the discount rate to be used in computing their present value. Given this uncertainty, as long as we cannot rule out that a climate-related economic catastrophe.\n\n4 For example, Pindyck (2013) argues that if there is a reasonable possibility that a catastrophic climate change might occur, then the social cost of carbon in the US could reach a price of $200. This is about ten times higher than the EUA price in our sample period.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nmay happen in the future, dirty Örms will be subject to carbon risk. In short, therefore, carbon risk in our context reáects the uncertainty about the future price for carbon allowances. As carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk, they will require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions. This argument informs our second testing hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 2 (H2)\n\nOther things being equal, carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk and hence require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions. This is a further reason why there is a carbon premium in stock returns.\n\n# 5 Data on Carbon Emissions and Stock Returns\n\n# 5.1 Sample Period\n\nThe sample period used in our analysis ranges from November 2003 to December 2012. This period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the EU ETS. It ends with the expiration of Phase II and, therefore, covers only the period during which carbon allowances were given to Örms for free. Note that this sample period commences 14 months before the beginning of Phase I, which runs from January 2005 to December 2007, and covers the full span of Phase II, which runs from January 2008 to December 2012.\n\nThroughout our analysis, we also consider a shorter sample period, which also begins in November 2003 but ends earlier in March 2009. The end date of the shorter period coincides with the passing of an EU law establishing Phase III of the EU ETS beginning in 2013 during which carbon allowances are mainly sold in auctions. Hence the shorter period captures the period over which the law stipulated the free allocation of carbon allowances. Hence during this period there was no uncertainty to Örms about whether they would receive free allowances or not. A detailed timeline of events is shown in Table 1.\n\n# 5.2 Stock Returns\n\nOur empirical analysis uses an extensive data set of monthly stock returns from Germany, which is the largest economy in the EU and is responsible for one quarter of EU carbon emissions. We focus on the 80 Örms currently trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which are included in the two main German stock indexes: the DAX (30 large caps) and\n\n5 The Örst EU law was passed on October 13, 2003: Directive 2003/87/EC. The second EU law was passed on April 23, 2009: Directive 2009/29/EC.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nthe MDAX (50 mid caps). Together the DAX and MDAX companies comprise more than 95% of the German stock market capitalization, which is indicative of the high degree of concentration in the German economy.\n\nOur main analysis excludes 15 of the 80 Örms for which we do not have monthly return observations for the full sample period. Hence we employ data for the remaining 65 Örms. In the robustness section, we show that using the full cross-section of 80 Örms does not a§ect our main Öndings. Monthly stock returns are calculated as rj;t+1 = ln(Pj;t+1) - ln(Pj;t), where Pj;t\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
