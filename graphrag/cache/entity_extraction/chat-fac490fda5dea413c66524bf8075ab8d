The UK Carbon Premium\n\nThe figure plots a rolling estimate of the annualized carbon premium for the UK (solid blue line) using a three-year rolling window. The carbon premium is defined as the CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio. The figure also plots the p-value of the carbon premium (dashed green line) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The units of the alpha are shown on the left vertical axis, whereas the units of the p-value on the right vertical axis. Each alpha is plotted at the midpoint of the rolling window, thus using 18 months of data before this point and 18 months of data after. The shaded area corresponds to the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009.\n\n|0.15|1.00|\n|---|---|\n|0.10|0.80|\n|0.05|0.60|\n|0.00|0.40|\n|-0.05|0.20|\n|-0.10|0.00|\n|-0.15|-0.20|\n|-0.40|-0.60|\n|-0.80|-1.00|\n\n2000    2001    2002    2003     2004    2005    2006     2007    2008    2009    2010     2011  2012         -value\n\nSample Period      alpha      p-value\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
