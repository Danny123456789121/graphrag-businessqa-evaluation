However, the integration of sustainability concerns in companies' long-term planning, strategic management, processes, and activities is still challenging, disconnected, and often conducted in isolation. Based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature, the present research presents a theoretical framework that is expected to enhance the adequate development and management of organizational sustainability-oriented practices — the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model. This model provides organizational managers with a structured framework to adequately understand, select, implement and assess sustainability promoting actions, based on the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools and involving the exchange of collaborative ideas between organizational stakeholders. The adoption of the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model is expected to foster change processes and innovations in the search for solutions for sustainability-oriented business models.\n\n# K E Y W O R D S\n\ncorporate sustainability, integrative sustainability, stakeholders, sustainable development, sustainable strategy\n\n# 1 I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nThe last five decades have witnessed a growing concern and a broad and important discussion regarding the impact of unsustainable practices. Scholars, professionals, and even common citizens are highly aware of the need to study and change behaviours (Rockstrom et al., 2009). Figure 1 shows main approaches and contributions regarding the implementation of the necessary changes towards sustainability and well-being.\n\nConcerned about the importance of adequately understanding the consequences of human development, the implications of its impacts and the problems caused by a changing lifestyle, the United Nations (UN), during its Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 (UN, 1972), introduced the principles that would later support the concept of sustainable development1 (SD). This concept would become a sociopolitical, economic, and environmental objective, ratified by the Brundtland Commission in the document entitled “Our Common Future” (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). Based on this work, Elkington suggests the understanding of sustainability through a three-dimensional vision, known as “triple bottom line” (TBL) (Elkington, 1999). Sustainability will be achieved through the adequate balance, in each moment, of the economic capital and its profitability, the environmental capital and its preservation, and the social capital and its equity (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, & Filho, 2014).\n\nThe definition of SD proposed in the Brundtland report is simple and attractive and has inspired different definitions for corporate sustainability (CS) — namely, the one developed by Dyllick and Hockerts (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002) and the one developed by Bansal (Bansal, 2005). However, all these definitions have the disadvantage of being vague, which hinders their adequate understanding and operationalization (Lankoski, 2016; Poddar, Narula, & Zutshi, 2019). Therefore, organizations face\n\nCorp Soc Responsib Environ Manag. 2020;1–13. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/csr © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\n# FIGURE 1 Evolution thinking to sustainable planet and well-being\n\nconsiderable challenges to attend to different stakeholders expectations and to adapt to the different socioeconomic and environmental-economic dynamics (Ostrom, 2009).\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, an increasing number of organizations are recognizing the importance of sustainability dimensions and are demonstrating their commitment to sustainability through the integration of this concept in their strategies and management models (Armindo, Fonseca, Abreu, & Toldy, 2019; Stubbs, 2019). According to recent studies, in most cases, the implementation of these strategies has been more superficial than effective, consisting of little more than a response to stakeholders pressures regarding responsible business performances (Schrettle, Hinz, Scherrer -Rathje, & Friedli, 2014). Therefore, it is still very important to continue studying the relation between organizational commitment towards sustainability and its effective implementation and performance.\n\nThis scenario leads to the need of developing new proposals aiming the orientation and promotion of organizational involvement with sustainability, leading to the reformulation of organizational behaviours. In this scope, the General Assembly of the UN has defined, in 2015, a new agenda for SD based on 17 principles that led to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), defending that sustainable production and consumption should be widely adopted by 2030 (UN, 2015).\n\nFor this transformation to take place, organizations need to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to promote SD (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002; UN, 2015) and to adequately understand the mechanisms and interactions needed to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINSTON JERÔNIMO SILVESTRE<|>PERSON<|>Winston Jerônimo Silvestre is a researcher affiliated with Instituto Universitário de Lisboa, focusing on corporate sustainability strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTO UNIVERSITÁRIO DE LISBOA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL) is an educational institution in Lisbon, Portugal, where Winston Jerônimo Silvestre conducts research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UFP ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH RESEARCH UNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UFP Energy, Environment and Health Research Unit (FP-ENAS) is a research unit at Fernando Pessoa University in Porto, Portugal, where Ana Fonseca is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANA FONSECA<|>PERSON<|>Ana Fonseca is a researcher affiliated with UFP Energy, Environment and Health Research Unit, contributing to studies on sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations (UN) is an international organization that introduced principles supporting sustainable development during its Conference on the Human Environment in 1972.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS<|>EVENT<|>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals established by the UN in 2015 to promote sustainable production and consumption by 2030.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINSTON JERÔNIMO SILVESTRE<|>INSTITUTO UNIVERSITÁRIO DE LISBOA<|>Winston Jerônimo Silvestre conducts research on corporate sustainability strategies at Instituto Universitário de Lisboa<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANA FONSECA<|>UFP ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH RESEARCH UNIT<|>Ana Fonseca is a researcher at UFP Energy, Environment and Health Research Unit, focusing on sustainability issues<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINSTON JERÔNIMO SILVESTRE<|>ANA FONSECA<|>Both Winston Jerônimo Silvestre and Ana Fonseca are involved in research related to sustainability<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS<|>The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals to promote sustainable practices globally<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
