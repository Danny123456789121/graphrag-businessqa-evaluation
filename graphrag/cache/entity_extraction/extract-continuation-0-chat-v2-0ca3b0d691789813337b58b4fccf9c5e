Thus, we expect:\n\n# Hypothesis 2\n\nIn East Asia, environmental CSR has a stronger positive effect on business performance than social CSR.\n\n# Operational performance vs. financial performance\n\nMost practicing managers and branches of organization and management research are interested in business performance as a recurrent theme (Richarc, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). In the CSR research area, CSR and business performance have mixed relationships partly because of diverse performance measures (Lev, Petrovits, & Ranhakrishnan, 2010; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006). CSR studies have adopted various business performance measures for ascertaining CSR benefits, including return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), market share, and employee commitment. To better understand our focal linkage, we must recognize and classify the core content of business performance.\n\nAmong previous classifications of business performance indicators adopted in CSR studies, financial and operational performance are most commonly used (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012). In this meta-analytic review, in accordance with Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986), we measure both financial performance and operational performance because both indicate firms’ wealth (Luo, Huang, & Wang, 2012). Financial performance is indicated by financial and market indicators reflecting achievements of the firm’s economic targets. Operational performance is indicated by outcomes related to the firm’s social relationships and competitive advantages leading to operational efficiency (Luo et al., 2012). Table 1 provides details of business performance measures included in this meta-analysis.\n\nSpecifically we argue that CSR would have a stronger positive association for operational performance than for financial performance, mainly because of the cost factor related to CSR activities. That is, in order to satisfy different stakeholders, CSR activities incur some cost and may consume the profit, especially in the initial stage of CSR (Lev et al., 2010). Firms must devote considerable resources to CSR activities that then affect the firm’s net outcome. In comparison, CSR directly and positively\n\n# M. Hou et al.\n\n# Jo & Harjoto, 2011; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006\n\n# Similar measures on Western CSR studies\n\nDoh et al., 2010; Brammer, Pavelin, Arora & Henderson, 2007; Sen & Maignan, Ferrell, & Hult, 1999\n\n# Bhattacharya, 2001 & Porter, 2009\n\n# Cao, 2011; Chang, 2009; Choi et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2006; Zhu & Sarkis, 2004\n\n# Some related East Asian CSR studies\n\nChoi et al., 2010; Li, & Zhang, 2010; Choi et al., 2010; Oh et al. 2011; Chun, 2009; Xie & Peng, 2011; Wang, Qiu, & Kong, 2011; Shen, & Chang, 2009\n\n# Measures of business performance\n\n|Specific indicators|Operational performance|Financial performance|Competitive-indicators|Financial-indicators|Market-indicators|Social-indicators|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|product design, quality control, labor productivity, Customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, employment|market share, market to book, stock|Venture management, technology development, marketing, distribution, customer service, cost investment, profit growth, return of equity, market returns, market share growth, export|Return on assets, return on equity, return on cash flow, sales growth|and income locally| | |\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\ninfluences operational indicators (Surroca, Tribo, & Waddock, 2010), such as corporate culture (Marcoulides & Heck, 1993), organizational reputation (Roberts & Dowling, 2002), and innovative technology (Cho & Pucik, 2005). A recent study showed that in Japan environmental CSR directly influenced technological innovation (Cole et al., 2006). Similarly, corporate citizenship has been shown to enhance employee commitment (Chun, 2009). Thus CSR strongly and directly drives operational performance. After cost-related issues are calculated, financial performance profits would be indirect outcomes. Consequently, we argue that CSR is positively related to operational performance and has varied effects on financial performance. More precisely, we hypothesize:\n\n# Hypothesis 3\n\nIn East Asia, corporate social responsibility has a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance.\n\n# CSR–performance contingencies\n\nWe have argued that CSR practice has a focal relationship with business performance in East Asian firms. Because the nature, connotation, and value of CSR practices may vary in different regions, industries and firms, we now address the contextual factors that may determine CSR profitability. Answering the call to compare CSR roles in various contexts (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012), we incorporated several contextual variables at the macro-level (economic development), meso-level (industry setting), and micro-level (firm size and organizational form) to examine the contingencies in the CSR–business performance relationship.\n\nWe had several reasons for choosing the contextual factors we examine. First, at the macro-level, institutional context plays important roles in determining appropriate CSR initiatives (Arya & Zhang, 2009). For example, domestic Kenyan organizations’ CSR approach is different from foreign organizations due to the different institutional environments of global and domestic markets (Muthuri & Gilbert, 2011). Therefore, we consider the contingent roles of economic development (developed vs. developing) to set conditions on the value of CSR practice. Second, at the meso-level, industry setting is important because not all CSR activities\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>GEO<|>East Asia is a region where environmental CSR is believed to have a stronger positive effect on business performance compared to social CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARC<|>PERSON<|>Richarc is a researcher who has contributed to the understanding of business performance in the context of CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVINNEY<|>PERSON<|>Devinney is a researcher involved in the study of CSR and its relationship with business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YIP<|>PERSON<|>Yip is a researcher who has co-authored studies on CSR and business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO & HARJOTO<|>PERSON<|>Jo & Harjoto are researchers who have studied the impact of CSR on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUO & BHATTACHARYA<|>PERSON<|>Luo & Bhattacharya are researchers who have explored the relationship between CSR and business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>PERSON<|>Aguinis & Glavas are researchers who have conducted meta-analytic reviews on CSR and business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURROCA<|>PERSON<|>Surroca is a researcher who has studied the influence of CSR on operational indicators.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIBO<|>PERSON<|>Tribo is a researcher who has contributed to the understanding of CSR's impact on business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WADDOCK<|>PERSON<|>Waddock is a researcher who has examined the relationship between CSR and business performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENYA<|>GEO<|>Kenya is a country where the CSR approach of domestic organizations differs from that of foreign organizations due to varying institutional environments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on the world.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>CSR<|>In East Asia, environmental CSR is believed to have a stronger positive effect on business performance than social CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARC<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>Richarc has collaborated with Aguinis & Glavas in researching business performance in the context of CSR<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVINNEY<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>Devinney has worked alongside Aguinis & Glavas in the field of CSR research<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YIP<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>Yip has contributed to the research efforts of Aguinis & Glavas regarding CSR and business performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO & HARJOTO<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>Jo & Harjoto have collaborated with Aguinis & Glavas in the study of CSR<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUO & BHATTACHARYA<|>AGUINIS & GLAVAS<|>Luo & Bhattacharya have worked with Aguinis & Glavas on CSR-related research<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURROCA<|>TRIBO<|>Surroca and Tribo have jointly researched the impact of CSR on operational performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIBO<|>WADDOCK<|>Tribo and Waddock have collaborated on studies related to CSR and its effects on business performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KENYA<|>CSR<|>In Kenya, the CSR approach varies between domestic and foreign organizations due to different institutional environments<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
