Nevertheless, it is recognized that there are difficulties in adequately operationalizing organizational sustainability into activities that can be understandable, functional, and quantified (Kyaw, Olugbode, & Petracci, 2017; Lankoski, 2016). This leads organizations to invest in sustainability by mere institutional reaction to stakeholder pressures, without an adequate intelligence approach. Therefore, the actions and behaviours triggered are frequently unrelated with the impacts that should be addressed (Porter & Kramer, 2006) and compromise the effectiveness of innovative actions and opportunities, as well as competitive advantages and value co-creation (Aquilani, Silvestri, Ioppolo, & Ruggieri, 2018).\n\nMore important than understanding the impact of sustainability factors, the major challenge faced by organizations, of any size and activity sector, is the lack of transversal knowledge regarding the impacts of their activities, which would allow the adequate understanding of how to integrate sustainability in their daily practices (Shields & Shelleman, 2015). The results of Kiron et al., obtained in a research study focusing large companies, show that 90% of executives perceive sustainability as something important, but only 60% were able to identify sustainability strategies (Kiron et al., 2017).\n\nMany strategies were developed with the aim to overcome this gap between sustainability intentions and sustainability practices, as referred by Bonini and Bové (2014), for example, extension of the scope of products life cycle, organizational strategy focused on sustainability, encouragement of open, honest, and transparent internal dialogues regarding sustainability efforts, support given to innovation, creativity, and initiative regarding sustainability issues (Bonini & Bové, 2014). In this scope, the voluntary implementation of integrated management systems (e.g., quality management, environmental management, and health and safety management) can be a relevant contribution to enhance sustainability-oriented practices. Several research studies have established a connection between the implementation of management systems and improvements in organizational sustainability (e.g., Qi, 2013; Gianni, Gotzamani, & Tsiotras, 2017; Testa, Boiral, & Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2018; Para-González & Mascaraque-Ramírez, 2019) because they share the focus on the relationship with different stakeholders — clients, competitors, and suppliers (quality management), communities and ecosystems (environmental management), and employees (health and safety management). Several authors agree that the integration of sustainability in organizations daily practices is imperative for its adequate development, namely, because of the following: (a) it improves competitivity and general well-being (Scherrer, Daub, & Burger, 2007); (b) it appeals to a holistic vision of the different sustainability dimensions (Lozano, 2015); (c) it allows the typifying of organizations actions and activities (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, & Leal Filho, 2016); (d) it is a relevant part of organizational strategic planning (Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017); and (e) it acts as a conceptual structure in the decision-making processes (Bonn & Fisher, 2011).\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\nEngert, Rauter, and Baumgartner (2016) refer that the proposals developed regarding sustainability integration processes only focus very specific questions, and in spite of the growing interest on these issues, theoretical contributions do not comprise intuitive approaches with practical implementation tools. These authors appeal that “future research should move from focusing on whether or not companies need to integrate corporate sustainability into strategic management to how this could be done in practice” (Engert et al., 2016; p. 2843).\n\nIn this scope, the model developed by Mass et al. (2016) must be referred: It considers three factors based on the quantification, management, and communication, through inside-out/outside-in perspectives of analysis (Maas et al., 2016). Another relevant contribution is the model developed by Morioka and de Carvalho (2016), based on organization's performance and considering four factors: processes and practices, skills, proposals, and contributions for the development of competitive advantages (Morioka & de Carvalho, 2016).\n\nA possible explanation regarding why organizational sustainability models do not define the operationalization of sustainability integration is the implicit complexity of its implementation. In order to successfully integrate sustainability in its daily practices, an organization must perform a deep reflection regarding the conception of sustainability that is more suited with its organizational culture, which will have to be reflected on its strategic and operative sustainability management (Lankoski, 2016).\n\nOrtiz-Avram et al. state the need of research studies aiming to increase knowledge and consolidate the notion of integrated sustainability (IS) focusing (a) connections and ethical values, (b) performance in the long term, (c) formal processes to develop IS, and (d) good-practice policies (Ortiz-Avram, Domnanovich, Kronenberg, & Scholz, 2018).\n\nSeveral authors agree that the necessary change regarding sustainability integration processes is provided by transformation skills resulting from organizational culture (Linnenluecke & Griffiths, 2010), because it is this organizational\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is an international organization that promotes global cooperation and addresses issues such as sustainable development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCKSTRÖM ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Rockström et al. are researchers who have contributed to the understanding of planetary boundaries and sustainability initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVINDAN<|>PERSON<|>Govindan is a researcher who has studied stakeholder pressures on organizations regarding sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYAW<|>PERSON<|>Kyaw is a researcher who has explored the operationalization of organizational sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANKOSKI<|>PERSON<|>Lankoski is a researcher who has examined the integration of sustainability into organizational practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIRON ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Kiron et al. conducted a research study focusing on large companies' perceptions of sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BONINI AND BOVÉ<|>PERSON<|>Bonini and Bové are researchers who have proposed strategies to bridge the gap between sustainability intentions and practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGERT ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Engert et al. have discussed the need for practical implementation tools for sustainability integration in organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Mass et al. developed a model for quantifying and managing sustainability in organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORIOKA AND DE CARVALHO<|>PERSON<|>Morioka and de Carvalho proposed a model focusing on organizational performance and competitive advantages related to sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORTIZ-AVRAM ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Ortiz-Avram et al. emphasize the need for research on integrated sustainability and ethical values.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCKSTRÖM ET AL.<|>UN<|>Rockström et al. contribute to the UN's agenda for sustainable development through their research on planetary boundaries.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVINDAN<|>UN<|>Govindan's research on stakeholder pressures aligns with the UN's focus on sustainable practices among organizations.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYAW<|>UN<|>Kyaw's work on operationalizing sustainability is relevant to the UN's goals for sustainable development.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LANKOSKI<|>UN<|>Lankoski's examination of sustainability integration supports the UN's initiatives for organizational sustainability.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIRON ET AL.<|>UN<|>Kiron et al.'s findings on executives' perceptions of sustainability are significant for the UN's agenda on sustainable practices.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BONINI AND BOVÉ<|>UN<|>Bonini and Bové's strategies for overcoming sustainability gaps are aligned with the UN's objectives for sustainable development.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENGERT ET AL.<|>UN<|>Engert et al.'s call for practical tools for sustainability integration resonates with the UN's efforts to promote sustainability.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASS ET AL.<|>UN<|>Mass et al.'s model for sustainability management contributes to the UN's focus on organizational sustainability practices.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MORIOKA AND DE CARVALHO<|>UN<|>Morioka and de Carvalho's model for competitive advantages through sustainability aligns with the UN's sustainability goals.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORTIZ-AVRAM ET AL.<|>UN<|>Ortiz-Avram et al.'s emphasis on integrated sustainability supports the UN's mission for sustainable development.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
