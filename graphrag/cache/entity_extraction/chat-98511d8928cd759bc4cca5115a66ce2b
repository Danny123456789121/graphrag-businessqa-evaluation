More specifically, healthcare providers can use responsible AI to improve market performance in healthcare, adopt AI-enabled customer relationship management systems to enhance service innovation, use AI-based decision support systems to provide automatically diagnose patient mental disorders, and augment medical diagnosis decisions.\n\n# Challenges\n\nGenerative AI can provide answers to prompts regarding healthcare but there are still a number of concerns.\n\nFirst, generative AI does not have sufficient transparency. Users would not be able to know how generative AI produces such answers. For end users, they do not know where the answers come from and why generative AI provides such a response. Without transparency, users are unlikely to develop trust in the answers of generative AI, particularly regarding healthcare matters and thus limiting its use.\n\nSecond, generative AI does not guarantee correctness and bears any responsibility for the answers it gives. Generative AI relies on the inputted materials which may or may not be correct. Thus, if users truly believe in the answers by generative AI, they may or may not obtain the correct answers. Unlike other contexts, generative AI may offer fabricated responses, thereby giving misinformation or information that are not applicable to users around the world.\n\nThird, generative AI may offer fabricated responses, thereby giving misinformation or information that are not applicable to users around the world. This is given that healthcare systems, policies, and regulations differ around the world. Well-accepted suggestions in one country may not be applicable in another country. Suggestions that go against local regulations or situations can cause problems for the users.\n\nFourth, generative AI would need multiple interactions with users to offer personalized recommendations. At least in the short term and without the user’s detailed medical history, generative AI is unlikely to provide more personalized recommendations than human doctors. Based on a patient’s detailed medical history and the accumulated doctor-patient interactions, doctors should be able to provide more personalized recommendations which likely are more workable and effective.\n\nFifth, generative AI evokes privacy concerns. This concern is more severe in healthcare contexts. Healthcare records are sensitive and strictly regulated in many countries. If users ask generative AI to provide answers, their healthcare conditions may be recorded, analyzed, and disseminated. A person’s healthcare information is valuable and may lure hackers or employees of generative AI companies to take illegal advantage of such data. This challenges generative AI to build firewalls for safety which are comparable with current healthcare systems in order to not be engaged in legal problems.\n\nSixth, users may not utilize the right text prompts to properly guide generative AI to provide the answers they want. For generative AI, it is a challenge to guide users to find suitable text prompts for their healthcare questions. Users who do not have ample healthcare knowledge may only know their symptoms, but not the name of the disease. More accurate text prompts are required for generative AI to provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. However, as the general users would not be aware of the specific names of the disease, it will likely require a doctor’s consult to identify what the actual disease is.\n\n# Research agenda\n\nThere are several RQs for future research with regard to the integration of generative AI into healthcare contexts. More specifically, the following RQs should be considered:\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Generative AI in Healthcare\n\n- How can generative AI increase its transparency to healthcare users?\n- In what circumstances and why would healthcare users use generative AI with limited transparency?\n- What level of responsibility should generative AI have on its suggestions for healthcare issues?\n- How can generative AI increase the correctness of its answers to healthcare issues?\n- How can generative AI incorporate the laws, policies, regulations, and circumstances when providing healthcare suggestions?\n- What aspects of generative AI can be designed to include comprehensive personal data and provide more personalized healthcare suggestions?\n- What legal or auditing efforts are needed to ensure that generative AI protect users’ privacy (e.g., health information)?\n- How can generative AI guide healthcare users to use proper “text prompts” to describe their symptoms (e.g., specific diseases and physiological terms)?\n- How can generative AI cooperate with healthcare professionals to develop interactive systems to facilitate medical diagnosis?\n- How can technology innovation diffusion or acceptance models be modified to better fit the context of generative AI in healthcare?\n\n# Generative AI in Human Resource\n\n# Overview\n\nThe developments in AI have happened in leaps and bounds. From the traditional types of ML, which include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, the developments in AI have moved toward generative AI, which uses language models for the creation of content as a response to inputs. Generative AI as a field is not new and there have been many developments in the early years of language models. For example, early models of natural language processing used n-grams. This has, however, evolved toward the large language models whereby new models of transformer-based architecture respond to human queries and generate content. Generative AI is expected to have huge implications on different functions, especially when it comes to interacting with human stakeholders. One such area is human resource management (HRM), where the possibilities of generative AI applications are huge, but there is relatively less diffusion as compared to other organizational functions.\n\nThe applications of generative AI in HRM have been gradually increasing. Recently, there have been quite a few reviews in the area of how the application of AI is shaping HRM. Generative AI can be used in HRM to improve the recruitment process, training and development initiatives, outcome of resource allocation, employee engagement, and so on. The outcomes of HRM decisions, such as who gets hired, better appraisal, preferred projects, and even terminated,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
