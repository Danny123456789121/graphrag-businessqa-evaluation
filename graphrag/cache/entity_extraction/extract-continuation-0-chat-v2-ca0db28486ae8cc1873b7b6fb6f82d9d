The practice approach is another\n\nidea for the CS policy and strategy; it recommends that the\n\nattention of companies is to be on the practice (Guohui and\n\nEppler 2008). A systematic approach is also an integral ap-\n\nproach; its impact is widespread in all sectors, especially in the\n\nconstruction industry (Davies 2009). The systematic approach\n\nis the holistic idea in such a sector because today’s decision\n\nmust have room for alteration for future generations (Hendriks\n\n2004). Fischer (2000) argued that the systematic approach\n\nadvocates for participatory decision-making instead of solo\n\ndecisions. This approach suggests taking the input of stake-\n\nholders for better decisions; by doing so, stakeholder’s per-\n\nspective adds insight wisdom to the process from the end-user\n\npoint of view; by this approach, policy and planning can\n\nbecome comprehensive.\n\nThe economic instrument policy approach is also\n\nsupporting in controlling environmental pollution. Bailey\n\n(1999) and Kennedy (1996) argued that business organization\n\ninternalizes the cost of pollution that they create in this ap-\n\nproach. Clarke and Roome (1999) emphasize the role of in-\n\ntermediaries in the adaption of environmental practices. In\n\norder to know the feasible option for SMEs, the\n\nintermediaries/consultants can provide access to readily avail-\n\nable expert knowledge to SMEs and can contribute and in-\n\ncrease their absorptive capacity.\n\nAchieving, sustainability goal in all sectors of human\n\nendeavor; requires a quality decision process for policy\n\nmanagement, which includes significant ongoing informa-\n\ntion gathering, processing, and disseminating efforts\n\n(Clark 2009). There are five different types of sustainabil-\n\nity impacts identified on governance modes: (i) centralized\n\ngovernance, (ii) decentralized governance, (iii) public-\n\nprivate partnership, (iv) interactive governance, (v) self-\n\nregulation (Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).\n\nThey explained the earlier two are traditional command-\n\nand-control approaches of policy. Driessen et al. (2012)\n\nfurther explained that, in the centralized-mode of policy,\n\nthe central government’s role is crucial, and the\n\ndecentralized-mode of policy is cantonal. They further ex-\n\nplained in the public-private partnership mode of policy\n\nthat the role of the public sector organization is to interact\n\nwith privates’ associations for policymaking. The fourth\n\nmode of governance is the collaborative governance\n\namong the public sector, private sector, and civil society\n\non an equal basis. The final mode of governance is self-\n\nregulation. Deakin and Hobbs (2007) argue that self-\n\nregulation model is an opportunity for a business organi-\n\nzation to embed in society.\n\n# Factors affecting corporate sustainability policy and practices\n\nIn the literature review, multiple factors were identified which affected policymaking and implementation of technological change and influence societal practices (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018). Fairbrass (2011) mentioned that government/public authorities need policy debate with interested parties comprised of different stakeholders in policymaking.\n\n# Role of government/public sector institutions\n\nKeeping in view the critique of Friedman (1962), the social dimension is not the responsibility of the business organization; however, governments through legislation may control the business organizations to comply with a social dimension. The report of Brundtland et al. (1987) also identified that government should control the careless use of natural resources, which creates an adverse effect on the environment. In this context, the role of the governments is essential for the implementation and monitoring of CS. In recent years to become competitive in the international market, the Chinese regulatory authorities have forced Chinese companies to adopt CS (Zhu 2016).\n\nAmong the emerging economies the manufacturing sector is highly energy intensive sector. Thus, it is essential to look into the CS issues (Yu et al. 2017). The industrial growth in China has produced a huge volume of Carbon Dioxide and is considered the most resource-consuming and polluting country. China can bring immense improvement in global environmental issues (Feng et al. 2018).\n\nBusch and Hoffmann (2009) and Luan et al. (2013) emphasized that government plays an instrumental role in putting the firms on track for eco-friendly attitude. Ecoprofit, an Austrian-based initiative, helps SMEs in reducing the environmental impact of SMEs. The company has implemented number of energy conservation projects with the help of local government (Beise and Rennings 2005; Rennings et al. 2006; van Hemel and Cramer 2002). Likewise, in Manali, an Indian tourism destination, stakeholders’ efforts failed to achieve their environmental objectives due to the local government’s lack of interest. Gardner and Sinclair (2003) explained that the role of the state was crucial in eradicating the pollution problems. In another example of government intervention to improve the environmental conditions, Xanthos and Walker (2017) described that pollution problems had compelled the governments to devise laws/policies to overcome the pollution problems.\n\nThe role of local government was also crucial in the implementation of policies (\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
