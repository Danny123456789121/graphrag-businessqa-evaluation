In the context of our data sample, 24 stocks received carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty and medium portfolios), whereas 41 did not (belonging to the clean portfolio). The second criterion for distinguishing between firms receiving a high number of carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty portfolio) and those receiving a low number of carbon allowances (belonging to the medium portfolio) is however ad hoc. Throughout our analysis, we draw the line between the dirty and medium portfolios at one million free EUAs. This implies that eight stocks belong to the dirty portfolio and 16 stocks to the medium portfolio. Note, however, that in the robustness section we comprehensively assess whether changing the composition of the dirty portfolio affects the results.\n\n# 6.2 Portfolio Returns\n\nOur first empirical finding is illustrated in Figure 2, which plots the cumulative returns of the dirty, clean and dirty-minus-clean portfolios for three sample periods. The first period is the pre-ETS period, which ranges from November 1998 to October 2003, and corresponds to the five years immediately before the ETS was passed into law. The second period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009, which is the period that begins with the passing of the law establishing the EU ETS and ends with the passing of the law that terminates the free allocation of allowances. The third period ranges from April 2009 to March 2014, which corresponds to the five years immediately after the second period.\n\nThe figure provides a stark contrast in the performance of the carbon portfolios before (upper graph), during (middle graph) and after (lower graph) the introduction of the EU ETS. In the five years before, the performance of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio revolves.\n\nWe use equally weighted portfolios because the cross-section of firms is not very large and hence equally weighted portfolios ensure that the performance of the carbon portfolios is not determined primarily by the largest firms. This is important since firm value in the German economy is highly concentrated in few firms. Note, however, that in unreported results we find that value weighted portfolios deliver qualitatively similar results.\n\n12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\naround zero. In the second period, the cumulative return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio increases monotonically and reaches a maximum value of about 100%. Finally, in the five years after the second period, the cumulative return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolios decreases monotonically. In short, this is preliminary evidence suggesting that firms that received carbon allowances substantially outperformed firms that did not for the period of November 2003 to March 2009, but not before or after.\n\n# 6.3 Factor Models\n\nNext we turn to the alpha (α) of the carbon portfolios, which is measured as the abnormal excess return relative to three standard factor models. This leads to three time-series regressions. The first regression is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is specified as follows:\n\nrj,t - rf,t = αj + βj (rM,t - rf,t) + εj,t; (1)\n\nwhere rj,t is the monthly return of portfolio j at time t for j being one of the dirty, medium or clean portfolios, rf,t is the monthly riskless rate at time t, rM,t is the monthly return to the market portfolio at time t, and εj,t is a normal error term.\n\nThe second regression is based on the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model:\n\nrj,t - rf,t = αj + βj1 (rM,t - rf,t) + βj2SMBt + βj3HMLt + εj,t; (2)\n\nwhere SMBt is the monthly return to the “small-minus-big” size factor, and HMLt is the monthly return to the “high-minus-low” value factor. We term this the F F 3 model.\n\nThe third regression is based on the Carhart (1997) four-factor model:\n\nrj,t - rf,t = αj + βj1 (rM,t - rf,t) + βj2SMBt + βj3HMLt + βj4MOMt + εj,t; (3)\n\nwhere MOMt is the monthly return to the momentum factor. We term this the F F 4 model. Note that the SMB, HML and MOM factors are specific to the German economy (see, Artmann, Finter, Kempf, Koch and Theissen, 2012).\n\n13\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 6.4 The Carbon Premium\n\nWe define the alpha of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio as the carbon premium in stock returns. This is the abnormal excess return of the dirty portfolio over and above that of the clean portfolio. By definition, it is also equal to the difference in alphas between the dirty and the clean portfolios. The size and significance of the carbon premium is the main focus of our empirical analysis.\n\nConsistent with our preliminary analysis, our main finding is that there is a high and significant carbon premium for the sample period that begins in November 2003 and ends in March 2009. This finding is illustrated in Figure 3, which plots a rolling estimate of the carbon premium relative to the CAPM using a three-year rolling window. Statistical significance is assessed by plotting rolling p-values of the alpha based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. Figure 3 identifies the exact timing of when the dirty-minus-clean portfolio delivers a high and significant alpha. The shaded area in the figure corresponds to the critical sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. The figure reveals that the alpha is high and significant only during this sample period\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EU ETS<|>EVENT<|>The EU ETS (European Union Emissions Trading System) is a market for trading carbon allowances, established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the EU.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN ECONOMY<|>GEO<|>The German economy is characterized by a concentration of firm value in a few large firms, impacting the performance of carbon portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The clean portfolio consists of stocks that did not receive carbon allowances, representing environmentally friendly firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRTY PORTFOLIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The dirty portfolio consists of stocks that received a high number of carbon allowances, representing firms with higher emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM PORTFOLIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The medium portfolio consists of stocks that received a low number of carbon allowances, positioned between the clean and dirty portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON PREMIUM<|>EVENT<|>The carbon premium refers to the abnormal excess return of the dirty portfolio over the clean portfolio, particularly significant during the period from November 2003 to March 2009.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>DIRTY PORTFOLIO<|>The clean portfolio and dirty portfolio are oppositional categories in the context of carbon allowances, with one representing environmentally friendly firms and the other representing higher emission firms.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRTY PORTFOLIO<|>MEDIUM PORTFOLIO<|>The dirty portfolio and medium portfolio are differentiated by the number of carbon allowances received, with the dirty portfolio receiving a high number and the medium portfolio receiving a low number.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>MEDIUM PORTFOLIO<|>The clean portfolio and medium portfolio are also oppositional categories, with the clean portfolio representing firms that did not receive allowances and the medium portfolio representing those that received a low number.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU ETS<|>CARBON PREMIUM<|>The EU ETS is directly related to the carbon premium as it establishes the framework for trading carbon allowances, which influences the performance of the dirty and clean portfolios.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMAN ECONOMY<|>CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>The performance of the clean portfolio is influenced by the structure of the German economy, which is characterized by a concentration of firm value in a few large firms.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMAN ECONOMY<|>DIRTY PORTFOLIO<|>The performance of the dirty portfolio is also influenced by the structure of the German economy, which affects how firms are valued based on their emissions.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON PREMIUM<|>DIRTY PORTFOLIO<|>The carbon premium is a measure of the performance difference between the dirty portfolio and the clean portfolio, highlighting the financial implications of carbon allowances.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARBON PREMIUM<|>CLEAN PORTFOLIO<|>The carbon premium reflects the performance of the clean portfolio in contrast to the dirty portfolio, indicating the financial benefits of not receiving carbon allowances.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
