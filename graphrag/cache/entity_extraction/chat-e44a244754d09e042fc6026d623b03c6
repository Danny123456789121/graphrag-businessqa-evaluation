These five stages are conceptualized into four indicators, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental.\n\nCompanies are currently required to improve their performance, namely by increasing their productivity. Productivity can be measured by comparing output and input during the production process. In this case, the company is required to pay attention to consumer tastes by increasing the quality and quantity of its products. In terms of increasing production, companies experience many problems that arise in relation to corporate sustainability, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental issues, starting from the level of efficiency and effectiveness of production costs as well as the waste production process. Companies in the production process must be able to develop an integrated, comprehensive, and efficient concept of sustainable and environmental costs, other social costs, and presents information in the financial statements. In the last two decades, green accountants have approached one aspect of material cost accounting (Jasch, 2003; Nakajima et al., 2015). Accordingly, environmental costs include environmental protection.\n\n# I Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\n\n# 2.2. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\n\nAccording to the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA), sustainability is based on a simple principle that can be interpreted as everything we need for the survival and well-being of life, which directly or indirectly affects the natural environment (www.epa.gov). Sustainability creates and maintains a condition in which humans and nature can live in harmony, which enables it to meet the social, economic and other needs of current and future generations. The concept of sustainability began to be introduced globally by the Brutland Commission in the Our Common Future reporting activity organized by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987). WCED connects sustainability with environmental and social integrity by creating a term called sustainable development which is defined as development that meets current needs without reducing the needs of future generations (WCED, 1987, p.43; (Linnenluecke & Griffiths, 2010).\n\n# 2.3. Financial Performance\n\nPerformance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. According to Epstein et al. (2015), the company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability (Amacha & Dastane, 2017; Tabash, 2019). The result shows that the majority of oil and gas companies in Malaysia had poor performance in terms of sustainability disclosure. On all three chosen profitability parameters, the companies that practiced sustainability were found to perform better than their counterparts that did not. Strong and significant relationship exists between sustainability practices and better financial performance. Financial performance is an achievement assessment of a company that can be seen from the company’s ability to generate profits. Financial performance is a company work achievement that has been achieved by the company in a certain period and contained in the company’s financial statements, so that one of the information that can be known by interested parties or users of financial statements to find out corporate profits (Pujiasih, 2013). Financial ratios connect various estimates contained in financial statements so that the financial condition and results of operations of a company can be interpreted (Lucyanda & Siagian, 2012; Angelia & Suryaningsih, 2015; Manurung & Rachmat, 2019; Manurung et al., 2020). Financial accountability is an accurate and precise focus on reporting about the use of public funds. The main purpose is to ensure that public funds have been used for objectives that have been established efficiently and effectively (Atmadja & Saputra, 2018).\n\n# 2.4. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\n\nAccounting, especially green accounting, is expected to be able to support the sustainable development of the company. Green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The company’s ability to apply green accounting in its business scope is expected to be able to manage costs related to the environment and, in the end, the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.\n\nH1: Green accounting implementation is able to improve CSMS implementation.\n\n# 2.5. Green Accounting in Financial Performance\n\nWhen a company applies green accounting and is able to show a good environmental performance, the impact is on good financial performance. This has been proven in both academic and empirical research, which states that financial performance, in this case the market value of the company, is strongly influenced by environmental performance, where the effect is positive. The relationship between environmental performance and financial performance can be observed in terms of income and costs. From the income side, it can be explained that consumer preference for consumer-oriented products allows these companies to enjoy market differentiation, competitive advantages, and consumers have a tendency to be willing to pay higher prices for environmentally-oriented products (premium prices). On the cost side, there are many benefits that\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
