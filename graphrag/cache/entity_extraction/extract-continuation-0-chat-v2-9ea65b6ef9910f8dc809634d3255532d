Because the value incorporated in a product or service is defined by its use (value-in-use) and not by its cost (value-in-exchange), the determination of the incorporated value is up to the final user (Vargo & Lusch, 2008).\n\nAs referred by Saarijärvi et al. (2013), it is crucial to adequately identify and understand “what kind of value is cocreated for whom, using what resources, and through what mechanism” Saarijärvi, Kannan & Kuusela, 2013. The amount of value co-created, as well as its perception, depends on the specific circumstances and actors present in this interaction, namely, the organization, its clients, business partners and society. This interaction may occur in different forms: business to consumer, business to business, business to governance or business to employee.\n\n# Transfer\n\nand enhance innovative performances throughout the organization. This stage of the ISI framework deals with the interactivity of the knowledge generated in the scope of the new ideas and interactions impacting and influencing the surrounding environments.\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\n# 9\n\nwith stakeholders, achieved in the previous stages. The established interchange is a semiotic relationship between the form and the content of the solutions to be implemented. This transfer is materialized through information interchange and knowledge communication between the organization and its internal and external stakeholders (Agle, Donaldson, & Freeman, 2008). The desired effect is the production of impacts between the different actors, which can be either positive or negative, and will vary in intensity and direction.\n\nThe transfer process is characterized by a high level of complexity regarding interactivity promotion either inside the organization and between the organization and its surrounding environments (Minbaeva, 2007; Spraggon & Bodolica, 2012). This is mostly given to the non-linearity of the relationship process established between the understanding and acknowledgement of the positive and negative consequences and of the strategic position that the organization should adopt in face of this problem to effectively and efficiently achieve the aimed impact.\n\n# II. Synergistic solutions:\n\nThis option will enhance higher collective performance levels when compared with individual actions. Therefore, the adoption of solutions with multiple associated factors will result in improved impacts in the process of problem solving.\n\n# III. Complementarity solutions:\n\nThe different solutions have a supportive effect and will complement each other in the contribution to problem solving.\n\n# Anticipate\n\norganization, as knowledge holder and the stakeholders, as knowledge users (Wood, 2010). The knowledge transfer process will therefore condition the stakeholder's use of this knowledge. Knowledge transfer is achieved through the use of relational networks established between all interacting parts in this process that share culture, history, language, political and social institutions (Beck, 2002). Antecipatory actions like imagining, designing, modeling, and simulating, are demonstrations of attempts to conquer a favorable position in the face of a not yet present condition that is called “future.”\n\nOrganizations are recognized to live and compete in a world with economic, social, and environmental interconnections and therefore have difficulties in independently resisting, or trying to resist, to unexpected events although maintaining a competitive position. The capacity to resist and respond to external and internal events and recover from them is called “resilience” (Rose & Krausmann, 2013). However, not all organizations are able to overcome and successfully adapt to these events, which are occurring with increasing frequency, diversification and associated challenges.\n\n# 4.2.4 | Act and consolidate\n\nThe expression “the future is now” raises a series of questions regarding what kind of actions should be assumed and developed, which is the most adequate time frame, and what are the potential management risks and impacts in social, environmental and economic dimensions. The knowledge acquired in the previous stages is an important basis to adequately act and predict impacts and consequences.\n\nThis last phase of the ISI framework deals with the implementation of the selected actions and the assessment of their impacts, enabling the organization to assume a consolidated position in problem anticipation and solving and enhancing new discoveries and new processes.\n\n# Solutions\n\nIn the previous stages, choices have been made, and consequently interrelations have been established between different actors, in the scope of a specific problem that needs to be solved. The results obtained lead to three possible types of solutions, with different impacts for the organization and its stakeholders:\n\n# I. Compromise solutions (“trade-offs”):\n\nSome factors have been compromised to favour other factors. This option requires a complete\n\n# 5 | CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe ISI framework proposed in this research is oriented to the analysis, understanding, enhancement and implementation of proposals with impact on CS. This framework's design was based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature.\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\nThe main contribution of the present research was the development of a guide to how organizations can systematically understand, select, implement and assess the sustainability they want to practice, enabling a holistic approach that can lead to the solution of specific problems and prevent potential negative impacts in the future. The proposed model is based on a flexible and circular approach, that enhances organizational skills regarding sustainability-oriented problem solving.\n\nThe ISI framework aims to link the “why” arising from a specific problem with the “how” conducting to the problem's solution, enhancing change and adaptation skills. This process should be built on the creative skills of the different actors in the different stages of the solution seeking process, thus promoting the analysis of how different choices may impact organizational sustainability.\n\nThe model developed in this research can be used in a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SILVESTRE AND FONSECA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Silvestre and Fonseca are researchers who proposed the ISI framework for analyzing and enhancing organizational sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISI FRAMEWORK<|>EVENT<|>The ISI framework is a model designed to analyze, understand, enhance, and implement sustainability proposals within organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALUE CO-CREATION<|>EVENT<|>Value co-creation is a participative process involving organizations and stakeholders to generate and transfer knowledge.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDERS<|>PERSON<|>Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have an interest in the outcomes of an organization's actions and decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization is a structured group of people working together to achieve common goals, often involving the management of resources and knowledge.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SILVESTRE AND FONSECA<|>ISI FRAMEWORK<|>Silvestre and Fonseca developed the ISI framework to enhance organizational sustainability practices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VALUE CO-CREATION<|>ISI FRAMEWORK<|>Value co-creation is a key component of the ISI framework, emphasizing stakeholder involvement in sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAKEHOLDERS<|>VALUE CO-CREATION<|>Stakeholders are integral to the value co-creation process, as they participate in generating and transferring knowledge<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAKEHOLDERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stakeholders interact with organizations to influence decisions and outcomes, impacting sustainability efforts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ISI FRAMEWORK<|>The ISI framework is designed to help organizations systematically understand and implement sustainability practices<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
