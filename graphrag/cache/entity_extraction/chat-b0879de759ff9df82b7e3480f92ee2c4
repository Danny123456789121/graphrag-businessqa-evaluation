However, the implementation of GAI in HT contexts comes with ethical, legal, social, and economic considerations that require careful reflection by HT firms. The purpose of this study is to offer a critical examination of the effects of GAI applications across a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the HT industry, in an effort to integrate practical and academic insights and foresights and drive academic research forward. Through the contributions of a purposeful selection of scholars, educators, and industry practitioners, along the tenets of the stakeholder theory of the firm, this study highlights the potential challenges and opportunities of GAI and considers how academics can navigate the (research) complexities of this rapidly evolving technological phenomenon.\n\n# Keywords\n\ngenerative artificial intelligence (GAI), ChatGPT, stakeholder theory, value co-creation and co-destruction, hospitality and tourism\n\n# Corresponding Author:\n\nTarik Dogru (Dr. True), PhD, Associate Professor, Director of Graduate Programs, Dedman College of Hospitality, Florida State University, Champions Way, Tallahassee, FL 32306, USA. E-mail: tdogru@dedman.fsu.edu\n\n# Impact Statement\n\nThis study critically reviews and discusses the role of GAI and postulates expert opinion on the implications of GAI for hospitality and tourism stakeholders. In so doing, this study provides a comprehensive discussion on this disruptive subject that inspires, provokes, excites, and engages hospitality and tourism scholars, researchers, educators, industry practitioners, and other stakeholders. This study further proposes an integrative conceptual framework of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms affects a wide range of HT stakeholders that may result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value through resource-based, ethical, financial, legal, educational, cultural, and technological mechanisms.
