Managers involved in an MCDA process may have limited access to data concerning all criteria or even the entire multinational company as a consequence of a lack of integrated information. Moreover, these issues can be solved by careful consideration of practitioners involved in the decision-making process when realizing that inputs are qualitative, in nature, and the time needed for options assessments. Then, the criteria and outcomes should be revisited when assessing corporate sustainability performance over time.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nconceptualization, M.I.; methodology, M.I.; software, M.I.; validation, M.I., Q.Z., R.S and M.F.; formal analysis, M.I.; investigation, M.I, Q.Z., R.S. and M.F; resources, M.I. and Q.Z.; data curation, M.I.; writing—original draft preparation, M.I.; writing—review and editing, M.I.,Q.Z.,R.S. and M.F; visualization, M.I.; supervision, Q.Z. and R.S.; project administration, Q.Z. and R.S; funding acquisition, Q.Z.
