Guenther2, and Edeltraud M. Guenther2,5\n\n# Abstract\n\nBoards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics–CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR.\n\n# Affiliations\n\n- 1 University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany\n- 2 Technische Universität Dresden, Germany\n- 3 The University of Auckland, New Zealand\n- 4 University of Pretoria, South Africa\n- 5 United Nations University—Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources, Dresden, Germany\n\n# Corresponding Author:\n\nJan Endrikat, Department of Management, University of Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.

Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).\n\n# Keywords\n\nboard of directors, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, meta-analysis, meta-analytic path modeling, meta-regression\n\nThe relationships between corporate board characteristics and firm performance are well researched in the strategic management and corporate governance literature. From an agency theory perspective, boards serve a monitoring function to ensure the alignment of managerial actions with shareholder interests (Fama & Jensen, 1983), reducing agency costs that may arise when managers pursue their own interests at the expense of shareholders. Resource dependence theory (RDT) highlights another function of the board, namely, the provision of access to resources, such as knowledge and networks, critical to firms’ success (Hillman et al., 2000; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Hillman and Dalziel (2003) suggest that both monitoring and resource provision determine the association between board characteristics and firm performance.\n\nWhile most studies concerned with board characteristics and firm performance focus on financial performance, recently several scholars have investigated the association between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR), a nonfinancial dimension of firm performance (de Villiers et al., 2011; Walls et al., 2012). CSR has become increasingly prevalent and visible within firms as a mechanism to cope with stakeholder demands and to manage societal expectations beyond firms’ financial aims (H. Wang et al., 2016). Evolving from a long-standing debate about firms’ responsibilities toward society and from an enormous body of empirical work concerned with the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance, the business case perspective increasingly prevails (i.e., the view that CSR enables firms to enhance their competitive advantage and that firms benefit from CSR in terms of financial performance, Carroll & Shabana, 2010). Recent studies (Eccles et al., 2014; Surroca et al., 2010), as well as earlier meta-analyses (Orlitzky et al., 2003), suggest a positive association.\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\nbetween CSR and corporate financial performance. CSR is deemed to create firm value by providing better access to valuable resources (Waddock & Graves, 1997), attracting high-quality employees (Turban & Greening, 1997), increasing customer value of products and services (Peloza & Shang, 2011), and enabling the development of intangible assets (Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Consequently, CSR can be seen as a strategic imperative and an increasing number of investors consider CSR in their decision-making (Khan et al., 2016). In view of the strategic importance of CSR and given the decisive role that boards play in corporate strategy and decision-making processes (Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002; Tang et al., 2015), it is important to fully consider reliable scientific evidence regarding the board characteristics associated with superior CSR.\n\nHowever, the available empirical evidence regarding these relationships is difficult to assess for at least three reasons. First, different studies provide conflicting evidence. For example, Walls and colleagues (2012) find a negative relationship between the number of directors and the environmental dimension of CSR and concluded that smaller boards “[. . .] can mitigate detrimental environmental performance more effectively” (p. 901), whereas Post and colleagues (2011) find a positive relationship between the same constructs, leading them to conclude that “[. . .] having more directors provides boards with more information about environmental issues (rather than the opposite argument that board size leads to chaos and inaction) [. . .]” (p. 211). Similarly, Galbreath (2016) reports a negative relationship between CEO–chair duality (i.e., a CEO that also serves as the chairman of the board) and CSR, whereas Ferrero-Ferrero and colleagues (2015)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>PERSON<|>Jan Endrikat is a researcher affiliated with the University of Hohenheim, focusing on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Hohenheim is a higher education institution located in Stuttgart, Germany, where Jan Endrikat is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DRESDEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technische Universität Dresden is a university in Germany, also associated with Jan Endrikat.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Auckland is a university in New Zealand, affiliated with the research study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Pretoria is a university in South Africa, involved in the research study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY—INSTITUTE FOR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL FLUXES AND OF RESOURCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>This United Nations University institute is located in Dresden, Germany, and is associated with the research study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>EVENT<|>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a concept that involves companies taking responsibility for their impact on society and the environment, which is a central theme of the research study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>EVENT<|>The board of directors is a group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and oversee the activities of a company, playing a crucial role in corporate governance and CSR.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM<|>Jan Endrikat is affiliated with the University of Hohenheim, where he conducts research on corporate governance and CSR.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DRESDEN<|>Jan Endrikat is also affiliated with Technische Universität Dresden, contributing to research in corporate governance and CSR.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>THE UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND<|>The University of Auckland is involved in the research study that Jan Endrikat is part of, focusing on CSR.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA<|>The University of Pretoria is part of the research study that Jan Endrikat is involved in regarding CSR.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAN ENDRIKAT<|>UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY—INSTITUTE FOR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL FLUXES AND OF RESOURCES<|>The United Nations University institute is associated with the research study that Jan Endrikat is conducting on CSR.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>The board of directors plays a significant role in influencing corporate social responsibility practices within organizations.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>The University of Hohenheim conducts research on corporate social responsibility, contributing to the understanding of its impact on firms.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DRESDEN<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>Technische Universität Dresden is involved in research related to corporate social responsibility, enhancing knowledge in this area.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>The University of Auckland participates in research studies focusing on corporate social responsibility.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>The University of Pretoria is engaged in research concerning corporate social responsibility, contributing to the field.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY—INSTITUTE FOR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL FLUXES AND OF RESOURCES<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>The United Nations University institute is involved in research on corporate social responsibility, focusing on integrated management of resources.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
