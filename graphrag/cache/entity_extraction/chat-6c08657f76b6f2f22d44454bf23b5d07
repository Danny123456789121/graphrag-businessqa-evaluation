GAI and Different Business Opportunities\n\nGAI design is a cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing product design. In today’s world of rapidly changing technology and increasingly complex manufacturing processes, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions. GAI design can help designers create more efficient and effective products by identifying stress points, determining where to cut and add materials, and streamlining the product design process. One of the key advantages of GAI design is that it eliminates the need for complex structures, resulting in products with a streamlined appearance. By using machine learning and advanced technologies, GAI design enables designers to improve their efficiency and create more effective and profitable products. This overview explores the various aspects of GAI design, including its capabilities and advantages for manufacturers.\n\n# a\n\nIn the manufacturing industry, computer-aided design (CAD) is now using GAI design to create product plans. This innovative approach, known as generative design, allows manufacturers to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their products by taking into account user preferences and input. The key difference between conventional and generative design lies in how the designs are created. While conventional design involves a manual, handcrafted approach, generative design uses AI algorithms to generate multiple solutions. This method is more efficient and quicker to implement than manual processes [28]. In addition to creating multiple solutions, the generative design also considers the various criteria set by the software, such as cost and performance. Generative design can create complex components and parts across multiple manufacturing industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and medical equipment. It can help optimize the design of these products for their specific use cases. Aside from being able to design multiple solutions, the technology can also be utilized to create custom parts and products. Various technologies are involved in AI computer-aided design software and machine learning algorithms.\n\n# b\n\nAI is being brought to a new level by the emergence of generative models. Foundation models are transforming the way applications are developed, reducing the time it takes to develop applications and providing more robust capabilities to non-technical users. Developers of products such as ChatGPT and Copilot are bringing AI into realms previously reserved for humans [29]. With the help of GAI, computers can now produce original content, sketches, and software code. They can also theorize about why a particular production error occurred. Developers can now build GAI systems capable of handling various tasks, such as searching and analyzing large datasets. These models were developed using foundation models trained on large, unstructured datasets. With little effort, developers can quickly adapt them to different applications. Developers can also use GPT-3.5, which is the foundation model of ChatGPT, to translate text. Scientists have also used it to create new protein sequences. These capabilities are accessible to everyone, including those lacking machine learning skills. Foundation models can also help developers speed up the time to create new AI applications.\n\n# c\n\nThe impact of technological progress on economic activity can be analyzed through three categories: production, interactions, and transactions. From the Industrial Revolution to the rise of AI, factory technologies have vastly improved manufacturing efficiency. Over the years, various technological changes have also affected transactions. In the past, technological interventions in interaction labor were often integrated seamlessly into human behavior, without being noticed or acknowledged. However, this has started to change. With the emergence of GAI, we are witnessing a transformative change in the field of customer service. These advanced tools have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of customer service operations by performing tasks with remarkable accuracy and timeliness.\n\nIn many cases, these tools are powerful and can work alongside humans to enhance their work efficiency. With GAI, we are witnessing the potential for technology to delve into a realm of creativity that has traditionally been exclusive to humans [30]. GAI technology leverages collected inputs and user experiences to create novel content. While discussions around the role of technology in fostering creativity may persist, it is widely acknowledged that employing GAI can aid in the development of new and innovative ideas.\n\nThere are plenty of business uses of these models. They are still in their early stages, but we are starting to see some applications designed to run across various functions. One of the primary uses of these models is in marketing and sales. They are typically focused on creating and implementing personalized marketing and sales content and creating assistants designed to work with specific businesses [31]. The goal of operations is to create task lists designed to be used efficiently during a given activity. Engineering and IT tasks involve writing, reviewing, and documenting code. The functions that are related to risk and the law include reviewing and analyzing reports, drafting legal documents, and answering complex questions. The goal of R&D is to improve the understanding of chemical structures and diseases. Table 2 summarizes the possible uses of GAI in different management fields, which will help businesses immensely.\n\n# Table 2.
