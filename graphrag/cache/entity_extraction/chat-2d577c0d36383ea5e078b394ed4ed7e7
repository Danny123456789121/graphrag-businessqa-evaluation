Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development. Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.\n\n# Economics\n\nThe outcomes showed the sub-attribute ranking: ECO4>ECO2>ECO6>ECO5>ECO1>ECO3, as seen in Figure 10. Firstly, risks and the management of economic and financial performance (ECO4) has a weight of 0.4932, whereas CSR and sustainability activities expenditure (ECO2) are ranked in the second position with a score of 0.4321. Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development.\n\nResults showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to operational and social resources, skilled personnel, preventive actions, and regulations adherence. The legal compliance with economic and financial aspects (ECO6) and economic and financial statements (ECO5) is considered at the third and fourth positions within the sub-criteria category of economics with a score of 0.2383 and 0.1894, respectively. Lastly, the development and impact of infrastructure investments (ECO1) and economic and financial policy and strategy (ECO3) with a weight of 0.1765 and 0.1634, respectively. Sustainability actions are the basic elements for putting the economic dimension into practice, and these actions consider profitability, financial stability and liquidity, and financial benefits [101]. Therefore, the CSR spending, the management of innovation and technology, knowledge management, collaborations, organizational processes management, and elaboration of sustainability reports are some of the relevant actions towards corporate sustainability [102].\n\n|Economic and financial statements|ECO4|0.4932|\n|---|---|---|\n|CSR and sustainability activities expenditure|ECO2|0.4321|\n|Legal compliance with economic aspects|ECO5|0.1894|\n|Development of infrastructure investments|ECO1|0.1765|\n|Economic and financial policy and strategy|ECO3|0.1634|\n\nFigure 10. Economics sub-criteria.\n\n# Environment\n\nResults showed the ranking within the Environmental dimension of corporate sustainability are as follows: ENV1>ENV4>ENV3>ENV2>ENV5, as shown in Figure 11. The highest weight, 0.5321, obtained of sub-criteria within the environment category is initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ENV1). Compliance with environmental regulations (ENV4) reported the second sub-criteria in the row with a weight of 0.4654. Whereas, environmental management and responsibility (ENV3) sub-barrier and commitment, scope, and dissemination of environmental policy (ENV2) are ranked at third and fourth positions, within the environmental sustainability category, presenting a score of 0.3936 and 0.3381, respectively. Finally, environmental cost-saving operations (ENV5) come fifth in the row with a weight of 0.2101. Government regulations have been the primary drivers of a part of corporate sustainability. Literature showed that environmental sustainability provides cost reductions for the businesses, and these reductions are related to the use of energy, raw materials, and water, as well as reducing waste generation. Environmental sustainability improves the company’s reputation for stakeholders and into the market which, in turn, eases acquiring new customers prone to environmental issues. The incorporation of EMS by companies leads to CO2 emission reductions as well as a reduction in pollution [103,104].\n\n# Social\n\nFigure 12 shows the outcomes, ranking the sub-criteria as follows: SOC1>SOC4>SOC5>SOC2>SOC3. The highest sub-attribute of social criteria is the commitment to societal development (SOC1) with a weight of 0.5464. Training employees through in-house programs (SOC4) is ranked at the second position, presenting a score of 0.4821. Companies must train their personnel to work in an integrated way. Additionally, companies must use integration between auditing services and administration support for building stronger relationships with stakeholders. These relations promote efficiency, may save resources, and provide assertiveness amongst personnel.\n\n# Environmental cost saving operations-ENVS\n\n0.2101\n\n# Commitment and dissemination of environmental policy-ENV2\n\n0.3381\n\n# Environmental management and responsibility-ENV3\n\n0.3936\n\n# Compliance with environmental regulations-ENV4\n\n4654\n\n# Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-TNVI\n\n0.532\n\n# Figure 11.
