(HRM) considering the rapid developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and their emerging implications for work processes in general and HRM in particular. In doing so, the primary purpose is twofold: first, to provide an overview regarding the developments in the field, and two, to develop a portfolio of research opportunities that will help HRM scholars to engage in impactful research advancing our understanding about generative AI, by theorizing and providing empirical evidence, to push the existing scientific boundaries. To get a comprehensive overview of the continuously evolving scene, we invited leading scholars to provide perspectives into key themes core to HRM. The perspectives underscore the need for HR professionals to understand and adapt to the changing AI landscape, particularly the transformative and disruptive potentials of generative AI on HRM planning, practices, processes, platforms, and productivity.\n\n# 1 | THE RISE OF GENERATIVE AI – UNRAVELLING THE KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS\n\nPawan Budhwar1, Soumyadeb Chowdhury2, and Geoffrey Wood3,4,5,6\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) tools and digital platforms, or at least tools and platforms that claim “intelligent status” have become an indispensable part for business organisations and society over the past decade. This stems from AI algorithms' ability to automate business processes, extract knowledge from big data, provide predictions and recommendations, and superior analytical and computational capabilities compared to human beings (von Krogh, Roberson and Gruber, 2023). The various forms of AI such as robotic process automation (e.g., cobots in warehouses), computer vision techniques, speech recognition, machine and deep learning algorithms, and natural language processing have created a plethora of opportunities and unique capabilities for organisations to redesign business processes and functions, innovate business models and offerings in consumer space (like data-driven agile and objective decision-making, project management and strategizing critical productivity indicators) (Kiron, 2022; Schrage et al., 2023). At the same time, as with many recent technological advances, it is difficult to disentangle hype from substance, and AI has proven more successful in some areas (e.g., generating superficially credible written text) than others (e.g., robots with genuine dexterity). It remains uncertain if generative AI deskills or destroys jobs, and/or creates new ones. It is paradoxical insofar as it takes work out of human hands and creates more work for humans by generating new information and decisions to be made in areas that may be of major importance or trivial.\n\nIn the past 5 years, human resource management (HRM) scholarship on AI has increased (Budhwar et al., 2022; Chowdhury et al., 2023; Edwards et al., 2022; Malik, Budhwar, & Kazmi, 2022). For instance, recent studies have emphasised the benefits of employing AI-based machine learning (ML) tools to promote diversity (Daugherty\n\nBUDHWAR et al.\n\net al., 2018), employee recruitment (Pan et al., 2022), factors influencing AI adoption among HRM managers (Suseno et al., 2022), increasing role of bots to enhance employee workplace experience (Malik, Budhwar, Patel, & Srikanth, 2022), the impact of AI on the job roles, responsibilities, tasks and meaningfulness of work (Wilson et al., 2017), the importance of embedding transparency within the AI algorithms (Chowdhury et al., 2022) and tensions that exist in creating algorithmic inclusion (Kelan, 2023). In this context, recent reviews have outlined the role of AI to facilitate HR analytics (Margherita, 2022), and its potential impact on HRM processes and practices (Pereira et al., 2023). However, it has also been linked to the deskilling of professional work (Xue et al., 2022), and potentially, may induce unethical management decision making.\n\nHowever, AI systems and types have also swiftly evolved creating new opportunities and challenges for both academic and business practitioners.
