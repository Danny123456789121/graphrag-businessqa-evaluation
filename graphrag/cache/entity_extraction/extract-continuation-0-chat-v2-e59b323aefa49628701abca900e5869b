Given the vast body of CEP–CFP studies, recently scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. However, no study so far has meta-analyzed the findings yielded by event studies assessing the stock market reactions to corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events). This paper sets out to close this gap by synthesizing previous empirical results regarding the stock market impact of positive and negative CEP-related events. Results indicate a positive relationship across studies in terms of positive market reactions to positive events and negative reactions to negative events. Furthermore, the findings show that the market reactions are stronger for negative events than for positive events (i.e., asymmetry in the stock market reaction). Finally, this study examines whether methodological artifacts (i.e., differences in the study designs) may explain the differences in the findings of the analyzed event studies.\n\n# Keywords\n\nCorporate environmental performance (CEP), Corporate financial performance (CFP), Event study methodology, Market value, Meta-analysis\n\n# Abbreviations\n\n|AR|Abnormal return|\n|---|---|\n|CAR|Cumulative abnormal return|\n|CEP|Corporate environmental performance|\n|CFP|Corporate financial performance|\n|CI|Confidence interval|\n|CSP|Corporate social performance|\n|CSR|Corporate social responsibility|\n|DJSI|Dow Jones Sustainability Index|\n|EMS|Environmental management system|\n|NRBV|Natural resource-based view|\n|UNGC|Accenture and UN Global Compact|\n\n# Introduction\n\nResearch on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been burgeoning for years and is still expanding. A plethora of empirical studies has been examining the CEP–CFP link and the question whether it “pays to be green” continues to receive unabated attention in both general media (e.g., Diamond 2009; Elgin 2007) and scholarly publications. Moreover, corporate practitioners are increasingly faced with external pressures from different stakeholders to behave responsibly toward the natural environment (Flammer 2013). According to the latest global survey of CEOs provided by Accenture and UN Global Compact (UNGC), 93 % of the 1000 surveyed CEOs believe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOROKA<|>PERSON<|>S.
