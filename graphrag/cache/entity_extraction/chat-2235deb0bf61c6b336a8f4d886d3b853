Similarly, Galbreath (2016) reports a negative relationship between CEO–chair duality (i.e., a CEO that also serves as the chairman of the board) and CSR, whereas Ferrero-Ferrero and colleagues (2015) do not find a significant relationship. Such conflicting empirical results undermine the establishment of credible scientific generalizations, impeding advances in managerial practice and regulatory reform.\n\nSecond, while studies examine various aspects such as board size, the number of outside directors, or CEO–chair duality and their relationships with CSR, most of them examine the board characteristics in isolation. Thus, while theoretically self-evident, little is known about whether, and how, certain board characteristics may interact with each other in their relationships with CSR (Galbreath, 2016; Oh et al., 2018; Rao & Tilt, 2016). In this vein, Jain and Jamali (2016) conclude from their review on corporate governance and CSR that future research needs to “[. . .] rethink CG [corporate governance] mechanisms as bundles rather than piecemeal” (p. 266). Moreover, prior empirical studies employ overly simplistic models that only investigate direct relationships while potential mediating mechanisms have been neglected. Finally, as CSR is becoming increasingly prevalent on a global scale and while several studies have begun to explore relationships between board characteristics and CSR in different institutional contexts.\n\n# Business & Society 00(0)\n\nsettings (Chang et al., 2017; Young & Thyil, 2014), we have limited knowledge about whether different legal and sociocultural contexts determine the focal relationships. Finally, CSR constitutes a multidimensional construct encompassing a range of aspects, such as employee relations, philanthropy, and environmental performance (Walls et al., 2012; H. Wang et al., 2016), which can be grouped into social and environmental dimensions. However, to date, no quantitative review has investigated the (potentially) different relationships between the social versus the environmental dimension of CSR and board characteristics.\n\nTo address and shed light on these issues, we draw on meta-analytic methods to further develop and refine the understanding of the relationship between board characteristics and CSR. Based on the available evidence from prior studies, we examine the relationships between CSR and board size, board independence, female board representation, CEO–chair duality, and the existence of a CSR committee. First, we quantitatively synthesize existing empirical research on the relationships between these board characteristics and CSR by means of random-effects meta-analysis. Second, we specify and test a meta-analytic path model to examine the interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and to investigate whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a mediating role. Third, we explore potential moderating effects by using meta-analytic regression analysis.\n\nOur study aims to make three contributions to the literature. First, in terms of an empirical contribution, we clarify the direction and strength of the relationships between certain board characteristics and CSR, drawing on cumulative data allowing us to provide more definitive answers than those reported in any single primary study. In particular, our analysis is based on 82 studies providing us with correlations based on a total of 167,317 firm-year observations. Thus, first, we resolve the uncertainties raised in the narrative review of Jain and Jamali (2016), by providing aggregated, generalized evidence regarding the relationships between CSR and the most widely empirically examined board characteristics; second, we move beyond Byron and Post’s (2016) focus on women on boards. While we find that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR, we do not find a significant relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR.\n\nSecond, we make a theoretical contribution and advance the literature by hypothesizing and testing a model that (a) accounts for the likely interrelatedness of board characteristics and their joint influence on CSR and (b) incorporates the potential mediating role of the presence of a CSR committee. Hence, we add to the recent literature that applies a more holistic approach.\n\n# Endrikat et al.\n\nand seek to uncover more complex relationships that might be at play in promoting CSR (Aguilera et al., 2012; Jain & Jamali, 2016; Oh et al., 2018).\n\nThird, our article also contributes to theory refinement by showing that country-level factors, as well as the specific dimensions of CSR, moderate the focal relationships. In particular, we provide evidence that investor protection strength moderates the relationships between board size and CSR and between board independence and CSR. We ascribe these results to countries’ investor protection substituting for these board-level influences. Moreover, we find that a country’s level of gender parity moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR, specifically that countries’ gender parity complements (or amplifies) the effect of female board representation on CSR. Those aspects can be hardly explored by primary studies due to data collection constraints (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Our findings in this regard establish some boundary conditions on the analyzed relationships and highlight the importance of taking into account macro-contextual factors when studying the relationship between board characteristics and CSR.\n\nFinally, our results show that the particular dimension of CSR that is examined (i.e., environmental vs. social dimension) influences board characteristics–CSR relationships. Hence, we add to the growing stream of research that acknowledges the multidimensional nature of CSR and thus seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of organizational commitment to society (H. Wang et al., 2016). In sum, our study is valuable both for advancing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
