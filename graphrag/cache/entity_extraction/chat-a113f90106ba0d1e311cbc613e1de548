It is possible that proactive efforts are more comprehensive and thus more costly since they are not targeted at resolving a specific problem. Therefore, these efforts may lead to more costs and do not necessarily lead to direct revenue benefits. Reactive efforts would be more targeted and less costly. They also may reduce fines paid and still allow firms to capitalize on the benefits of stating that they are environmentally friendly.\n\nSome firm characteristics do influence the CEP–CFP relationship while others do not. Our moderator analysis suggests that small firms seem to benefit from environmental performance as much or more than large firms. Perhaps small firms are able to compensate for a lack of slack resources by being more flexible (e.g., Chen and Hambrick 1995; Fiegenbaum and Karnani 1991; Storey 1994; Yu 2001). Private firms, however, do not appear to benefit any more than public firms. These firms may reap similar benefits through different means. The decreased public and media interest surrounding private firms may enable them to exercise more discretion in choosing the types of environmental initiatives they pursue (Dean et al. 1998). On the other hand, public firms may be able to capitalize on the environmental initiatives they do pursue as a result of additional media attention. Environmental performance also does not seem to matter any less for the “worst-offenders”, although subject to a different regulatory environment, than for other firms. Therefore, results of studies using samples consisting only of high polluting firms may be more generalizable than previously thought. Moreover, perhaps due to differences in economic, political, and social environments, US-based firms do appear to benefit more than international counterparts. This may be due to a more stringent regulatory environment in the US, wherein lower environmental performers end up being\n\npenalized. It could also be due to other firms preferring to do business with compliant producers. International firms may be less likely to be held to the same standards, and in fact may be selected based on non- or even anti-environmental criteria, namely cost.\n\nIn response to past methodological-based criticisms of CEP–CFP research, we meta-analyzed the moderating role of financial and environmental performance measures and data sources. Interestingly, we did not find support for a number of moderators. This is particularly insightful given the abundance of evidence over these issues in the field. In this case, the lack of results provides important insights about CEP–CFP research and hopefully puts an end to some of the ongoing criticisms about this research. Environmental performance has a similar relationship with most indicators with the exception that market-based performance indicators have a stronger relationship than others. The choice of environmental performance measure has also been criticized. Yet, the relationship between CEP and CFP was consistent for emission measures (i.e., TRI) and other measures of environmental performance (i.e., KLD). This does not suggest that the choice of financial performance and environmental performance measures may not be guided by theory, only that from a practical standpoint, the choice of financial measures does not appear to be the reason for past inconsistencies in the literature. Further, from a practical standpoint, firms may reap a wide range of benefits from environmental initiatives given the robust and positive nature of the CEP–CFP relationship across a wide range of measures for both variables. We were also surprised to find no differences between studies utilizing a 1-year or more lagged financial performance variables and those measuring environmental and financial performance in the same year. It is possible that the use of a longer lag time criteria may offer different results. To date, little is understood regarding the time necessarily to fully capture the benefits of environmental initiatives, as the number of longitudinal studies remains limited. We also found that self-reported data does not tend to be more strongly associated with performance than archival measures. This suggests that self-reported measures of environmental performance may not be significantly biased after all. Overall, much of the criticism of CEP–CFP research methodology appears unfounded.\n\n# Limitations and Future Research\n\nThe use of meta-analytic procedures is not without limitations. First, our results cannot demonstrate causality of the relationships tested. For example, it is possible that firms with strong financial performance are more likely to invest in environmental initiatives. Unfortunately, we did not have enough longitudinal studies examining the CEP–CFP relationship to analyze this issue. Future research should examine this important relationship. The measures of environmental performance that we used are the ones available from the existing studies and should be interpreted with caution. Contrary to existing frameworks, our findings that reactive and proactive environmental performance does not lead to significant differences in financial performance. Perhaps future research could evaluate different time horizons. It seems likely that reactive approaches are more likely to create immediate or short-term returns, whereas proactive initiatives require more significant up-front investment and may not pay off for longer periods of time. We feel this is an interesting area for future research to explore as well with additional theoretical development being especially important.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe results of our meta-analysis confirm and extend the findings of Orlitzky et al. (2003) in demonstrating that existing empirical studies support the position that it “pays to be green.” However, our findings regarding the moderating influences on the CEP-CFP relationship suggest that future research should investigate additional moderating influences to better understand this relationship. Of particular interest would be relationships that help guide managers in understanding the conditions that lead to the greatest performance benefits when supporting the environment.\n\n# References\n\nMarked References (*) are Included in Meta-Analysis\n\nAmbec, S., & Lanoie, P.
