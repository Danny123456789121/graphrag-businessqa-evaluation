Thus, “doing the right thing”, is an exhibited behavior among Plan Creation employees. Certainly, this behavior is in line with the sustainable leadership practice of ethical behavior.\n\n“PlanToys products help to support child development very well. I feel very confident in letting my children plays with PlanToys products because it made from the wood with high quality of standards. I would prefer my children playing with wooden toys rather than plastic toys.” (Customer A)\n\n“I have PlanToys on our office desk. When we are stressful, we can play them. PlanToys usually helps us to think of innovative ideas.” (Customer B)\n\nConsistent with the sustainable leadership practices of stakeholder focus, social responsibility and knowledge management, sharing is the next practicing virtue at Plan Creation as demonstrated in its living core values. This virtuous value of sharing impacts many business activities [5] here as discussed below.\n\n“Learning is the key success factor for our company. Our management team has paid attention to sharing. For example, knowledge sharing especially through the use of internet to disseminate PlanToys’ knowledge. The company has a lot of knowledge, but they are all over the place. We actually have an idea to put everything about PlanToys in the website. With the search function, users everywhere can easily search and acquire useful information.” (Managing Director)\n\nPlan Creation really “shares”, as endorsed by the corporate sustainability predictor of sharing [5].\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n“Employees here have a very kind heart. They are friendly, supportive and considerate. Sharing with others and sharing to the society are one of the most important core corporate values.” (Plant Director)\n\n“We always support each other as it is part of our core values. If we work at Plan Toy and meet other employees outside the company, we always help each other. At PlanToys, everyone is equal. There is no competition among us. We are friends and family.” (HR Officer)\n\n“Externally, we always exchange and share knowledge with people in our community. Every year, there are groups of visitors and students visiting our company. Students are always interested and ask questions. This is considered an imperative way of knowledge sharing.” (HR Officer)\n\n“Internally, not only we provide training to employee, but also on Wednesday morning we have a shared event called “Fresh Up in the Morning” for managers to share new knowledge or new experience for about 15 min. Department managers take turn to speak to all employees.” (Plant Director)\n\n“If any educational institution is interested in learning more about PlanToys, our top management is willing to be a speaker to students because we would like to share our success and failure stories to others. We strongly believe that our knowledge and experience is beneficial to the society. We are happy to share good practices that can further help to develop some sort of good business models for other organizations. We do not prohibit information sharing.” (Marketing Officer)\n\nWith a Sharing policy, knowledge is shared throughout the organization, enabling Plan Creation to rely on the organizational system, as opposed to a few individual Gate Keepers. Endorsed by the sustainable leadership practices of valuing people, developing people continuously and long-term employee retention, PlanToys gives its people priority. Avoiding staff layoffs, Plan Creation preserves firm-specific knowledge and skills embedded in employees, most of which have worked for Plan Creation for a long time. During an economic downturn, these firm-specific knowledge and skills have helped the company to get back on track with the market demand in a timely manner, enhancing corporate resilience. Externally, the company supports educational visits. Depending on which aspect Plan Creation shares, the sharing practice has helped the company to develop a stronger capacity to bring about the quadruple sustainability outputs.\n\n“When there is a job vacancy, the company always gives an opportunity to internal staff first. If anyone is interested in this new position, s/he can apply and go through the recruitment process. If we cannot fill in the position with internal staff, then the company makes a job posting and announcement for outsiders.” (Production officer A)\n\nAlso in line with the sustainable leadership practice of knowledge retention and sharing, knowledge at Plan Creation, as one of the two basic conditions of the Sufficiency Economy philosophy, is manifested through its living corporate values. Endorsed by the resilience predictor for corporate sustainability [5], knowledge at Plan Creation is exceptional since it results in many innovations. Plan Creation strictly adheres to a manufacturing policy of exceeding customer requirements all the time. It ensures the highest quality and safety and delivers products on time. Technologies are improved continuously to ensure the highest level of cost efficiency so that it can set a competitive price and allow for maximum flexibility. Clearly, quality is part of its corporate culture. For example, the company developed a chemical-free kiln to dry the wood, followed by the use of water-based dyes, non-formaldehyde glue and organic color pigment to ensure the highest safety of toys for kids and for employees in the company.\n\n“We incorporate innovation in our products. Many people ask about the sufficiency economy philosophy. They wonder why we pay attention to innovation which seems to be the opposite of the sufficiency economy. We explain that it is not true. Sufficiency Economy is the philosophy to run business sustainably. To survive in business, we need to differentiate our company. Innovation is the solution to our business. Innovation can be incorporated into design, function, or materials.” (Managing Director)\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\nMarket analysis is carried out at Plan Creation on a continuous basis to guide innovations to ensure its corporate alignment with the changing market needs. Plan Creation’s innovations are frequently built upon its strong expertise in utilizing local and simple materials. Typically, the company develops a new product from in-house materials, which often means a partial use of its existing manufacturing equipment. Thai wisdom is also a foundation for most innovations at Plan\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLAN CREATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plan Creation is a company focused on sustainable leadership practices, ethical behavior, and knowledge sharing among its employees and the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANTOYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PlanToys is a brand under Plan Creation that produces high-quality wooden toys aimed at supporting child development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER A<|>PERSON<|>Customer A is a consumer who expresses confidence in the safety and quality of PlanToys products for children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER B<|>PERSON<|>Customer B is a consumer who uses PlanToys in the office to relieve stress and inspire innovative ideas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH UP IN THE MORNING<|>EVENT<|>Fresh Up in the Morning is a weekly event at Plan Creation where managers share new knowledge or experiences with employees.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKETING OFFICER<|>PERSON<|>The Marketing Officer at Plan Creation is responsible for promoting the company's knowledge sharing and educational initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANT DIRECTOR<|>PERSON<|>The Plant Director at Plan Creation oversees operations and emphasizes the importance of sharing and corporate values.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HR OFFICER<|>PERSON<|>The HR Officer at Plan Creation highlights the supportive and friendly culture among employees.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLAN CREATION<|>PLANTOYS<|>PlanToys is a brand produced by Plan Creation, focusing on sustainable and high-quality toys for children.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOMER A<|>PLANTOYS<|>Customer A expresses confidence in the safety and quality of PlanToys products for children.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOMER B<|>PLANTOYS<|>Customer B uses PlanToys in the office to relieve stress and inspire innovative ideas.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANT DIRECTOR<|>PLAN CREATION<|>The Plant Director emphasizes the importance of sharing and corporate values within Plan Creation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HR OFFICER<|>PLAN CREATION<|>The HR Officer describes the supportive and friendly culture among employees at Plan Creation.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKETING OFFICER<|>PLAN CREATION<|>The Marketing Officer promotes the knowledge sharing and educational initiatives of Plan Creation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRESH UP IN THE MORNING<|>PLAN CREATION<|>Fresh Up in the Morning is an event organized by Plan Creation to facilitate knowledge sharing among employees.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
