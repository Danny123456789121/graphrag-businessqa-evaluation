CEO–chair duality refers to whether the same person jointly holds the titles of chief executive officer and chairperson of the board (Bergh et al., 2016). We define CSR committee as the existence of a board committee specifically responsible for CSR-related matters, and in practice, these committees may also be referred to as “sustainability,” “corporate ethics,” or “environmental” committees (Helfaya & Moussa, 2017).\n\n# Board Size and CSR\n\nRegarding the monitoring role of boards—the primary focus of agency theory arguments pertaining to boards of directors—it has been argued that larger boards are more actively involved in monitoring and evaluating activities and are less susceptible to managerial domination (Zahra & Pearce, 1989). According to RDT—highlighting the resource provision function of directors—firms should benefit from larger boards, because there are more directors, who can each provide access to resources, such as specialized knowledge and networks (Hillman et al., 2009; Pfeffer, 1972). In particular, the presence of more directors potentially provides more external links and knowledge to secure critical CSR resources, more CSR-related experience, knowledge, advice, and counsel (Dalton et al., 1999; de Villiers et al., 2011). Therefore, we state the following hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Board size is positively related to CSR.\n\n# Board Independence and CSR\n\nFrom an agency theory viewpoint, outside directors are better monitors of managers, as they are independent of the top management team and the firm (Dalton et al., 1998; J. L. Johnson et al., 1996). Because CSR goes hand in hand with a more long-term orientation of firms (Eccles et al., 2014) and as\n\n# Business & Society 00(0)\n\nCSR activities need some time to translate into firm value (Carroll & Shabana, 2010), outside directors may be more likely to foster CSR, because they tend to pursue longer time horizons and thus are more likely to see the long-term potential of investments in environmental and social projects (de Villiers et al., 2011; Post et al., 2011). Also from an RDT perspective, the number of independent directors should relate positively to CSR because they are more likely to have, and provide, access to alternative sources of CSR-related knowledge and networks, than directors who are associated with the firm. Therefore, our second hypothesis is:\n\n# Hypothesis 2 (H2): Board independence is positively related to CSR.\n\n# Female Board Representation and CSR\n\nResearch from multiple disciplines provides evidence that women differ from men with regard to morals and ethics (Borkowski & Ugras, 1998; Jaffee & Hyde, 2000), educational background and expertise (Hillman et al., 2002), and risk preferences (Croson & Gneezy, 2009). In general, women are deemed to be more concerned with social issues (Elm et al., 2001). Moreover, women have different ways of thinking, have superior communication skills, are less prone to suffer from overconfidence, and provide unique resource portfolios, including distinct risk-taking attitudes (Huang & Kisgen, 2013; Jeong & Harrison, 2017), which are likely to predispose them toward a positive attitude toward CSR. A recent meta-analysis—exclusively focusing on women on boards and CSR—found a positive relationship between female directors and CSR (Byron & Post, 2016). However, we deem it meaningful to reexamine this relationship for two reasons. First, we embed this relationship in our meta-analytic path model testing the mediating role of CSR committees. Second, we complement the findings of Byron and Post (2016) by investigating potential differences between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR in our moderator analyses. We state the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 3 (H3): Female board representation is positively related to CSR.\n\n# CEO–Chair Duality and CSR\n\nAbove, we argued that board independence is likely to be positively related to CSR. One aspect that can undermine a board’s independence is the leadership structure of the board. A CEO that also serves as chair of the board\n\nEndrikat et al. - 9\n\n(i.e., CEO–chair duality) may not be trusted by shareholders to effectively monitor his or her own activities as CEO. CEO–chair duality also induces management entrenchment and thus decreases the monitoring effectiveness of the entire board (Finkelstein & Aveni, 1994). In essence, CEO–chair duality increases information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and strengthens managerial power in the boardroom, as a CEO–chair is able to monopolize board meetings and advance his or her own agenda to the detriment of the firm (de Villiers et al., 2011; Finkelstein & Aveni, 1994). In the context of CSR, this would imply that it is easier for short-term-oriented, profit-maximizing CEOs to advance their own agenda at the expense of long-term CSR-related investments if they are also chair of the board (de Villiers et al., 2011). In contrast, separate CEO and chair positions provide further checks and balances and may prevent that a CEO can divert board attention away from CSR activities that are likely to have longer payback periods (Galbreath, 2018a). We therefore propose the following hypothesis:\n\n# Hypothesis 4 (H4): CEO–chair duality is negatively related to CSR.\n\n# Mediating Role of the Presence of a CSR Committee\n\nSo far, we have followed the majority of the prior literature and provided arguments for direct relationships between CSR and each board\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
