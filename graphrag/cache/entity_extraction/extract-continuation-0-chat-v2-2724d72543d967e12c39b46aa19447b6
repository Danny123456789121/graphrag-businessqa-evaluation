Thus, more than a decade after Orlitzky et al. (2003), it seems to be the right time to revive the paperâ€™s spirit and ask: when generalizing existing research, is there still evidence that it pays off to be a good firm?\n\nTo answer this question, we apply a second-order meta-analysis. In other scientific disciplines like medicine, psychology, or education (i.e. research areas typically also experiencing vast amounts of data and conflicting results), meta-analytic techniques are widespread and have been applied since the 1960s (Glass, 1976; Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter, Schmidt, & Jackson, 1982). With the growing number of meta-analyses, the idea of cumulative meta-analysis also appeared (Kazrin, Durac, & Agteros, 1979). Several labels have been used for such analyses: overview of reviews, review of reviews, umbrella reviews, meta-reviews, cumulative meta-analyses, meta-meta-analysis, and second-order meta-analysis (Cooper & Koenka, 2012). However, until recently, no standard procedure with comparable rigor to first-order meta-analytical approaches had emerged. This paper makes use of the novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis proposed by Schmidt and Oh (2013).\n\nWe contribute to the academic inquiry on the CSP-CFP relation in several regards. By summarizing the findings of existing meta-analyses and utilizing a data sample that is more than 25 times larger compared to the average of previous studies, we are able to generate fairly robust results. Not only do we demonstrate that the main findings of Orlitzky and colleagues still hold today, but our results deliver more unequivocal and comprehensive conclusions. The highly significant, positive, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation varies in magnitude depending on different CSP dimensions and CFP categories, but effect sizes are less variable than expected. Surprisingly, the relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key aspect. We highlight that a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation exists when operational CFP is considered. Furthermore, we conclude that shrinking CSP-CFP correlations in meta-analyses over time can be ascribed to more sophisticated research methods and are not observable at primary study level. Finally, we address potential biases resulting from the studiesâ€™ publishing source: we show that social issues-oriented and lower-impact journals as well as methodological weaker papers do not distort the CSP-CFP relation. The practical relevance of our second-order meta-analysis is: the business case for being a good firm is undeniable.\n\n# Hypotheses\n\nTheoretical arguments support a positive, negative, as well as neutral CSP-CFP relation. Arguments supporting a positive CSP-CFP relation are typically rooted in stakeholder theory (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Freeman, 1984), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), or draw on the industrial organization literature (Porter, 1979). When arguing for a negative CSP-CFP relation, scholars usually refer to Levittâ€™s (1958) or Friedmanâ€™s (1962, 1970) logic of social responsibility of the firm to solely increase its profits. Moreover, arguments based on portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952, 1959) point towards disadvantageous limitations for portfolio construction when picking stocks following a CSP filter. Finally, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970, 1991) argue for a neutral â€“ or at least non-exploitable â€“ relation of CSP and CFP, as all information is priced at any time by the market. This also includes potentially business-relevant CSP information.\n\nNext to these differing theoretical perspectives, the empirical CSP-CFP debate to date faces several questions. Even though considerable primary research has been conducted, it still remains less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and whether the business case holds as well for different measures of CFP. Eventually, questions of robustness and moderating effects arise which need to be answered in order to derive.\n\nÂ© 2018 The Authors.

This paper seeks to answer some of these questions.\n\n# The general CSP-CFP Relation\n\n# Direction of the CSP-CFP\n\nIn the academic literature, to date, the business case for CSP seems to be increasingly accepted and empirically supported (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Eccles, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Flammer, 2015). In line with the outcomes of previous research that summarized large numbers of primary research (e.g. Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003) we, thus, propose:\n\nH1a: CSP and CFP are generally positively related across a wide variety of study designs.\n\n# Causality of the CSP-CFP Relation\n\nNext to the general CSP-CFP relation, the subsequent question pertains to the causality of this relation. Proponents of good management theory (Waddock & Graves, 1997) argue that prior good CSP leads subsequently to better CFP. The opposite explanation is the slack resources theory (Cyert & March, 1963; J. B.
