The “Introduction” section gives a brief profile of CS concept, the “Material and method” section addresses theoretical exposition, the “Literature review” section CS policy and practices, the “Results and discussion” section addresses different policy approaches, and finally, the “Concluding remarks” section addresses the factors affecting CS policy and practices.\n\n# Literature review\n\n# Profile of corporate sustainability\n\nOver the last few decades, different researchers investigated the domain of social obligations of businesspersons. During the evolution of CS, Andrew Carnegie (1889), a businessperson/philanthropist, wrote an essay on the concept of social obligation, wherein he emphasized the wealthy class of society needs the philanthropic/well-being of the poor (laborers) who are trying to bring social change in their lives. People in business need to understand the difference between social responsibility and charity (Clark 1916); he further added that the problem is not helping society’s deprived class. However, it is the approach and perspective of businessmen who help the under privileged class with charity rather than business responsibility. Berle (1932), in his scholastic note, calls for the attention of the trust factor between business and societal well-being. Abrams (1951), Clark (1926), and Kreps (1940) also discussed the social obligation of businesspersons.\n\nIn subsequent decades, scholars further extended the research work of the social responsibility of business organizations. Howard Bowen is considered the father of CSR in the western world (Carroll 1999; Türkel and Akan 2015). In 1953, Howard Bowen argued for business organizations’ social obligation and explained that CS practices brought a competitive advantage for the organization.\n\nSince the early years, the concept of CS remained a complex—known as social responsibility in the 1950s and 1960s. Davis (1960) explained that business leaders could deal with the social responsibility of the businesses in the next fifty years.\n\n# Theories on CS policies and practices\n\nIn the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, the research related to the theoretical framework of CS incepted, and in this\n\n# Fig. 1 Graphical representation of data of Table 2\n\nWiley Online Taylor & Francis Emerald Springer Sage Elsevier\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020\n\nEnviron Sci Pollut Res (2021) 28:10335–10356 10339\n\n# Policy and practice of corporate sustainability\n\nThe popularity of CS influenced the policy and planning approaches (McLean and Borén 2015). Perrini and Minoja (2008) emphasized that corporate behavior towards sustainability has gained a central position among sustainability-conscious decision-makers. Policy formulation and implementation are two different domains (Galbreath 2009), and according to Kotler (2001), policy implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organizational objectives. Therefore, despite focusing on sustainability policy and planning, failures in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
