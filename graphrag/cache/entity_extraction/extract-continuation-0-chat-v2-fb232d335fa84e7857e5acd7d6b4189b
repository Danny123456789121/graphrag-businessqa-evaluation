The novel VS-TOPSIS tool enables the transformation of experts' linguistic preference to vague set assessment matrix, as well as arranges all the obtained individual profit ratio matrix into the decision matrix. The ranking order can be computed to offer a specific direction for firms to utilize SRM practice to effectively and efficiently improve their CS performance.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this study is to explore the inter-relationship between SRM and CS and identify the decisive measures towards CS. This study provides three contributions: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment data and social media information and address the inter-relationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM practice to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.\n\n# 2. Literature review\n\n# 2.1. CS and SRM\n\nThe concept of CS originated from the sustainable development concept (Engert and Baumgartner, 2015; Tseng, 2017). Elkington (1997) proposed planet, people and profits to provide the operational understanding for CS within a business context. Then, Cater and Rogers (2008) formally developed the TBL structure. Afterwards, many CS studies emerged with concentration on the discussion of the economic, social and environmental aspects (Shi et al., 2017). However, the three traditional components of TBL enable insufficiently the coverage of the overall concept of CS (Esquer-Peralta, 2007; Wu et al., 2018). Wu et al. (2019b) also argued there are overlaps among the TBL dimensions, and some operational practices have encountered dilemmas when classifying the operations and actions into TBL aspects as well. Hence, socio-environmental, socio-economical and eco-efficiency aspects have been supplemented to TBL to assist decision makers in precisely distinguishing the practices (Esquer-Peralta, 2007; Wu et al., 2018). More studies these years started to discuss about these newly developed aspects. For example, Heikkurinen et al. (2019) stated companies launching extended eco-efficiency actions can move towards a more sustainable economy. Qiao et al. (2019) found disregarding the socio-environmental losses might lead to failure in the decision process for developing sustainability. Wu et al. (2019a) supposed socio-economical aspect needed to consider social and economic perspectives simultaneously.\n\nBringezu and Bleischwitz (2017) defined SRM as “utilizing the natural resources in rational ways and maximizing human well-being without impeding the supporting of the living eco-system.” In previous literature, several studies have noticed the importance of considering socio-economic, socio-environmental dimensions into SRM towards CS. Dong et al. (2017) noted socio-economic played a critical role in developing urban sustainability for SRM based on literature analysis. In addition, Meng and Han (2018) explored the nexus among transport infrastructure sustainability, socio-economic and socio-environmental factors, and investigated the causal relationships between the variables. Additionally, eco-efficiency is proposed as a win-win operational strategy by means of consuming fewer natural resources and reducing financial costs for companies (Wu et al., 2018; Heikkurinen et al., 2019), while the discussion of the eco-efficiency was ignored in previous SRM studies.\n\n# 2.2. Proposed hybrid method\n\nPrevious studies adopt qualitative data or quantitative data when they address the topic under SRM. For example, Ng et al. (2019) represented a systematic framework of SRM through gathering the quantitative data from the waste and resources action program and Tesco firm. However, the qualitative data need to transform with the purpose of performing valid quantitative computation following the appropriate way. Tseng and Bui (2017) noted that some mistakes may occur during the process of translating qualitative information to quantitative forms. Furthermore, these qualitative experts' respondence always contained ambiguous and uncertain information (Tseng, 2017). Thus, vague set theory was applied in this study to transform qualitative information into quantitative data.\n\nAlthough existed SRM studies aim at systematically addressing the inter-relationship among SRM attributes, these studies mainly rely on statistical models to examine the relationship based on the independence, linearity and correlation (Liu et al., 2019). Accordingly, the interdependent and exerted feedback effects cannot acquire better demonstration. Therefore, Tseng et al. (2019a) proposed a hybrid fuzzy synthetic method to assess CS performance. However, fuzzy set theory only considered positive evidence by obtaining the single membership function (Gau and Buehrer, 1993). Moreover, TOPSIS was proposed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) aiming at addressing interrelationship inside selected attributes, and it is established by the thought that the selected ideal alternatives should have a minimum geometric distance from the positive ideal consequences and maximum from the negative ideal outcomes. It is commonly recognized as an easier and fast decision-making approach on firm's level (Huang et al., 2011; Behzadian et al., 2012). Therefore, this study combines the VS theory and TOPSIS technique to overcome the drawbacks of fuzzy sets and provide a handy tool for corporate decision-making, as well as fully considering the interdependent and systematic feature of SRM and CS (Tseng et al., 2019a).\n\n# 2.3. Proposed measures/practices\n\nExtending products' life span (C1) was stated as a highly effective strategy for reducing the use of economic resource loop (Bocken et al., 2016). Meanwhile, through utilizing optimal capability (C2), firms can achieve greater efficient performance in generating and managing economic resource (Lin and Tseng, 2016).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VS-TOPSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The VS-TOPSIS tool is a hybrid decision-making method that integrates vague set theory and the TOPSIS technique to improve corporate decision-making and assess performance in sustainable resource management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SRM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sustainable Resource Management (SRM) is a framework aimed at utilizing natural resources efficiently while maximizing human well-being and supporting ecosystems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Sustainability (CS) refers to the management approach that seeks to create long-term stakeholder value by considering how a given organization operates in the ecological, social, and economic environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese automobile industry is a sector that is being guided towards corporate sustainability under severe resource constraints.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEIKKURINEN ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Heikkurinen et al. are researchers who have contributed to the discussion on eco-efficiency actions and their role in moving towards a sustainable economy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WU ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Wu et al. are researchers who have explored various aspects of sustainability and resource management, including socio-economic and socio-environmental dimensions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATER AND ROGERS<|>PERSON<|>Cater and Rogers are researchers who developed the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) structure for understanding corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELKINGTON<|>PERSON<|>Elkington is a researcher who proposed the concept of the Triple Bottom Line, focusing on planet, people, and profits in a business context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOKEN ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Bocken et al. are researchers who suggested extending products' life span as a strategy for reducing economic resource use.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VS-TOPSIS<|>SRM<|>The VS-TOPSIS tool is designed to enhance decision-making in the context of Sustainable Resource Management (SRM)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SRM<|>CS<|>Sustainable Resource Management (SRM) is essential for achieving Corporate Sustainability (CS) by optimizing resource use and enhancing well-being<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY<|>SRM<|>The Chinese automobile industry is implementing Sustainable Resource Management practices to improve sustainability under resource constraints<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEIKKURINEN ET AL.<|>SRM<|>Heikkurinen et al. have researched the importance of eco-efficiency actions in the context of Sustainable Resource Management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WU ET AL.<|>SRM<|>Wu et al. have discussed the socio-economic and socio-environmental dimensions of Sustainable Resource Management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATER AND ROGERS<|>CS<|>Cater and Rogers developed the TBL structure, which is foundational for understanding Corporate Sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELKINGTON<|>CS<|>Elkington's concept of the Triple Bottom Line is a key framework for Corporate Sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOKEN ET AL.<|>SRM<|>Bocken et al. proposed strategies for Sustainable Resource Management, such as extending product life spans<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
