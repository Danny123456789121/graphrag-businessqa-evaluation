The same regression is significant after 50 bootstrapping repetitions. Furthermore, we did not find significant impacts of the type of bank on the prediction of the financial or the sustainability performance. The only significant coefficient for the type of bank is for the prediction of the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, because state-owned banks have a higher NPL ratio than other banks.\n\n# 6. Discussion\n\nThis study analyzed the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of Bangladeshi banks. We used panel regressions with one-year time lags and both financial indicators and a sustainability score SS as dependent and independent lagged variables, respectively. The analysis of all scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh found that a higher SS performance leads to better financial performance one year later. However, the study also suggests that better financial performance does not lead to higher sustainability performance in the following year. The results shine a light on organizational ethics and sustainability in the Bangladeshi banking industry.\n\nConcerning the type of sustainability performance, our results indicate that all three, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, have been increasing in parallel over time. Environmental sustainability and green products and services, however, are not growing stronger than social sustainability, as could have been expected after the introduction of the ERM guidelines. Finally, we found that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.\n\nThe following sections will discuss the results based on legitimacy theory [20]. According to this theory, the banks in our sample should react to institutional pressure reactively. They do not engage in sustainability activities proactively as would be predicted by strategic CSR [73].\n\nThe institutional pressure conducted through the ERM guidelines drives Bangladeshi banks to become more sustainable. They want to take the opportunity of the lower-cost capital provision by Bangladesh Bank and wish to avoid the adverse effects on their legitimacy of not reacting to the.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999\n\nguidelines. This reaction increases the banks’ sustainability performance and finally improves their financial performance, as found in many other studies [8,38].\n\nThe somewhat surprising result that increased financial performance does not improve sustainability performance can also be interpreted based on legitimacy theory. The banks in the sample react to outside factors and perform socially desired sustainability activities in return for approval of their business activities. However, they do not strategically internalize sustainability. If they did, the additional financial returns would lead to increased sustainability activities in the following year. In our study, however, we only found an impact of the sustainability performance on the lagged financial performance and not the other way around as, for instance, Waddock and Graves [83] report.\n\nWe also found a strong connection between the size of the banks, measured by their total assets, and their sustainability performance. This result is also in line with the legitimacy theory [19, 20], stating that bigger organizations are more exposed to public pressure and therefore invest more in their reputation [84] and stakeholder relations [85]. Additionally, Alberici and Querci [35] found that the quality of environmental activities of finance organizations increases with their size.\n\nSimilar to Islam and Kokubu [85], we found a general increase in all three types of sustainability activities. Again, legitimacy-based activities are rather reactive and general instead of addressing particular business activities and trying to improve their sustainability performance. Instead, the Bangladeshi banks address prevailing societal norms asking for corporate sustainability in general instead of specific actions that are connected to the banks’ business. Therefore, we also found only a few banks that have implemented green financial products and services.\n\nConcerning organizational ethics and sustainability in South Asia, the results suggest that regulatorily induced sustainability activities have a positive effect on Bangladeshi banks. Some studies in other world regions came to similar conclusions, for instance, in China [7, 86], but also in North America and Europe [87]. The missing connection between financial performance and sustainability performance at a later stage, however, seems to be specific for the Bangladesh sample. Waddock and Graves [83] established this connection and explained it with the institutional impact on both corporate sustainability performance and financial performance. Furthermore, they explain the positive impact of the sustainability performance on financial performance with the good management theory [88, 89]. Hence, it seems that sustainability is not a part of good management in Bangladeshi banks yet and that the banks in the sample do not realize that they can create additional value through sustainability approaches [90].\n\nAnother interesting issue related to corporate sustainability in South Asia is that environmental sustainability is more often mentioned by the banks in the sample than social sustainability. However, topics such as inclusion and equality are a top priority in many South Asian countries [4, 91]. The latter includes stakeholder engagement, community building, social inclusion, and so on. These issues should be at the core of sustainable banking in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. However, an earlier study by Khan and Islam [13] suggests a similar result. Hence, it looks like there has not been much change in addressing social sustainability issues. As expected, the Bangladesh ERM did not improve this situation but only influenced the environmental performance of the banks.
