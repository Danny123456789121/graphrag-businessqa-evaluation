The fail-safe k indicates the number of studies with a mean effect size of zero that would have been necessary to yield an insignificant (p = 0.05) summary effect. All the computations for integrating effect sizes, identifying confidence intervals, and calculating heterogeneity indicators were performed with the help of the software program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis.\n\n# 4 Results\n\n# 4.1 The causal relationship between CP and CFP\n\nThe analysis of the overall relationship between CP and CFP was based on all the bivariate effect sizes assessing CP–CFP correlations and yielded a significantly positive summary effect of 0.094 (k = 100, n = 132,319, p < 0.001). When taking into account the file drawer problem by calculating the fail-safe k, these results seemed robust. An additional number of 59,027 null-effect observations would have been needed to make the result insignificant (p = 0.05). This result enables us to answer RQ1 with a clear yes and establish the positive relationship between CP and CFP as the starting point for further elaborations of this study (Table 1).\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\n# Table 1 Results of the bivariate relationship between CP and CFP\n\n|Bivariate relationship|k|n|r m|90% CI|Q B|p|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|CP–CFP (total)|100|132,319|0.094***|0.067 - 0.120|0.000| |\n|CFP time lag| | | | |7.93**|0.019|\n|Prior|19|45,470|0.007|−0.067 - 0.080|0.882| |\n|Concurrent|47|53,549|0.136***|0.102 - 0.170|0.000| |\n|Subsequent|34|33,300|0.082***|0.040 - 0.124|0.002| |\n\nk number of effect sizes, n total sample size, r m mean product-moment correlation, CI confidence intervals, Q B between-group Q statistic, p significance level of r m /Q B. *, **, and *** indicate significance of p < 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.\n\nTo take a closer look at this relationship and answer RQ2, the sample of effect sizes was split up into subgroups according to the temporal sequence of time measurement. First, it is important to acknowledge that the introduced time lag has a significant impact on the yielded results (Q B = 7.93, p = 0.019). The integrated effect size based on concurrent measurements of CP and CFP shows the strongest relationship between the two variables (r m = 0.136, k = 47, n = 53,549, p < 0.001). However, no conclusions on a causal relationship can be drawn from this result. When looking at subsequent measurement of CFP, we find a significantly positive correlation coefficient (r m = 0.082, k = 34, n = 33,300, p = 0.002), implying that CP indeed has a positive impact on subsequent CFP, which would suggest the implementation of CP into management control systems. When examining the relationship of prior CFP to CP, on the other hand, no significant relationship can be found (r m = 0.007, k = 19, n = 45,470, p = 0.882).\n\nBefore analyzing further results, it is important to note that correlations based on concurrent CP and CFP measurements do not imply any causal relationship between these two variables. For these relationships, it is unclear which indicator influences the other. Bearing this in mind, research questions are answered based only on relationships which included a time lag in the measurement. Accordingly, the results presented in Tables 2 and 3 are exclusively derived from subsequent measurements of CFP variables. However, for the sake of completeness and to set further ground for theoretical discussions, results including concurrent measurements are reported within the text.\n\n# 4.2 Study design factors\n\nOperationalization of CFP Results of the performed subgroup analysis according to different study design factors are presented in Table 2. The first study design factor which was assumed to influence the relationship between CP and subsequent CFP was the CFP indicator, represented either by accounting or by market-based measures (RQ3a). Our meta-analysis results indicate that there is no significant difference between subgroups which employed either one or the other operationalization of CFP (Q B = 0.305, p = 0.581). The positive relationship holds for both accounting (r m = 0.061, k = 14, n = 21,752, p = 0.028) and market-based measures (r m = 0.085, k = 24, n = 22,102, p = 0.016).
