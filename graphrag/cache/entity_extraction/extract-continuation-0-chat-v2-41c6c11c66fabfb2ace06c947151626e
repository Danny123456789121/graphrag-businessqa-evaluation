The first phase of the FAHP method comprises the calculation of the nine most important criteria’s weights and, at the second stage, we determined the 45 sub-attributes weights in total. Figure 6 presents the hierarchal structure of corporate sustainability with the main attributes and sub-attributes.\n\n# 4.2. Prioritizing Main Attributes\n\nThe FAHP computed the weight of each sustainability attribute in a hierarchical structure. The main attributes are presented in Table 5 and reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic is the most important criteria by obtaining the highest weight of 0.4129. The importance of criteria were as follows: Economic (0.3754), Corporate Governance (0.2532), Natural Environment and Climate (0.2195),\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\nEnvironmental (ENV), Energy Consumption and Saving (0.1775), Transparency and Communication (0.1210), Social (0.0542), and Product Responsibility (0.0492) criteria, respectively. The details of each main sustainability indicator’s weights are presented in Table 5. The rapid spreading of the pandemic involving COVID-19 is the most influential barrier disrupting corporate sustainability. The pandemic has affected overall business performances. Economic sustainability and governance was the second most important indicator in our analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects, it brings new challenges for corporations to affect their ability to operationalize sustainability. In addition to new compliance and regulatory parameters, it appears to be a mandatory part of corporate sustainability in the organization. Therefore, corporations need to develop a corporate sustainability system in order to cope with these new issues and enable more sustainable business practices.\n\n# Table 5. Main corporate sustainability attributes.\n\n|Main Criteria|Code|Weight|Rank|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Pandemic|PEN|0.4129|1st|\n|Corporate Governance|CGOV|0.2532|3rd|\n|Product Responsibility|PR|0.0492|9th|\n|Transparency and Communication|TC|0.1210|7th|\n|Economic|EC|0.3754|2nd|\n|Environmental|ENV|0.1871|5th|\n|Social|SOC|0.0542|8th|\n|Natural Environment & Climate|NEC|0.2195|4th|\n|Energy Consumption and Saving|ECS|0.1775|6th|\n\nAccording to the calculation of the main sustainability attributes’ weights, the Pandemic attribute came first in the main corporate sustainability criteria. To this end, organizations should develop an emergency response plan to tackle any emergency, which may become a hurdle in the effective implementation of corporate sustainability. Hence, organizations should develop a sustainable structure that can prevent the organization from crises. Moreover, organizations should also implement suitable and long-lasting sustainability practices that assure optimal progress toward sustainability and provide benefits while utilizing scarce resources. Further, it was observed that the delivery time of goods supplies has been drastically disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, organizations need to develop a sustainable delivery system like just-in-time (JIT), which provides a more resilient solution during any emergency faced by the organization. Economic sustainability, governance, and natural environment and climate took their position after the pandemic attribute. Whereas product responsibility came last and observed the least essential attributes by obtaining the lowest weight (0.0492). The 45 sub-attributes of the study were evaluated through with the help of expert’s opinion, according to the pairwise comparisons matrix.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n# Sustainable Corporate Corporate award and recognition\n\n# Sustainability Management and audit of corporate governance\n\n# Corporate governance report\n\n# Structure and dynamics of corporate governance\n\n# Ranking/Evaluation of Corporate Governance\n\n# Corporate governance accountability\n\n# Conflict of interest in corporate governance\n\n# Public Private Partnership on sustainability\n\n# Product Responsibility\n\n# Personal impacts of product use\n\n# Indirect impacts of product\n\n# Compliance with products and policies\n\n# Product research and development\n\n# Product complaint mechanism\n\n# Transparency and Communication\n\n# Misunderstanding of integration concepts\n\n# Reduced flexibility after integration\n\n# Increase in bureaucracy due to intertwining\n\n# Development and impact of infrastructure investments\n\n# CSR and sustainability activities expenditure\n\n# Economic and financial policy and strategy\n\n# Economics\n\n# Risks and management of economic performance\n\n# Economic and financial statements\n\n# Legal compliance with economic and financial aspects\n\n# Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n\n# Scope, and dissemination of environmental policy\n\n# Environmental\n\n# Environmental management and responsibility\n\n# Compliance with environmental regulations\n\n# Environmental cost saving operations\n\n# Commitment to societal development\n\n# Social\n\n# Supplier management and resolution of society's demands\n\n# Training employees through in-house programs\n\n# Commitment to HR development\n\n# Commitment to societal development\n\n# Natural Environment & Climate\n\n# Labor relations and with society\n\n# Supplier management and resolution of society's demands\n\n# Training employees through in-house programs\n\n# Commitment to HR development\n\n# Initiatives to reduce energy consumption\n\n# Energy consumption and saving\n\n# Investing in renewable energy\n\n# Energy saving policies\n\n# Energy use efficiency\n\n# Emergency response plan\n\n# Commitment to employee safety\n\n# Pandemic\n\n# Just-in-time (JIT) and lean delivery\n\n# Social distancing and modification in working hours\n\n# Figure 6.
