A meta-analytic investigation\n\nMingjun Hou1 & Heng Liu2 & Peihua Fan3 & Zelong Wei1\n\n# Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015\n\n# Abstract\n\nAcademics and practitioners have long wondered whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) practice is beneficial for Asian firms. To better understand the relationships between CSR and business performance, we use meta-analytical techniques based on 31,773 East Asian firms reported in 28 empirical studies to provide cumulative evidence for the value of CSR. Meta-analytic results indicate a general positive association between CSR and business performance. We find that environmental CSR has a stronger impact than social CSR on business performance, and that CSR practice has a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance. Further meta-analytic evidence indicates that several moderating issues explain significant variances in the effect size across studies, including economic development stage (developed vs. developing), firm size (SMEs vs. non-SMEs), organizational form (public vs. private), and measurement methods (archival data vs. self-report). Moreover, we find that CSR importance in East Asia has not varied over the past 15 years. We conclude with theoretical contributions and practical implications.\n\n# Keywords\n\nEast Asia .

Hou et al.\n\nunderstanding CSR in Asia (i.e., Scholtens & Kang, 2012) but has found controversial results regarding CSR effects on performance. CSR in Asia has been positively (Cheung, Tan, Ahn, & Zhang, 2010; Choi, Kwak, & Choe, 2010; Cole, Elliott, & Shimamoto, 2006; Oh, Chang, & Martynow, 2011), negatively (Li, & Zhang, 2010), and non-significantly (Cao, 2011) related to performance. CSR performance impacts also have been found to depend on contingent factors (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012) or performance indicators (Allouche & Laroche, 2005). The inconclusive results may stem from the failure to consider contingencies, inadequate measurement issues, and insufficient data (Lee, 2008).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to extend CSR research in contexts outside of the Western world and to ascertain the relationship between CSR and business performance of East Asian firms.1 We aim to clarify the issue by conducting an updated meta-analysis of the relationship to answer three salient questions. First, debates are ongoing as to whether it is worthwhile to pay attention to societal demands, so we question CSR effectiveness in the East Asian context by asking: How does CSR relate to business performance in East Asian firms? Second, to answer demands for investigating additional contingencies in the CSR–performance link (Barnett & Salomon, 2012), we ask: Is the relationship between CSR and business performance in East Asia moderated by economic development (developed vs. developing), and company attributes (industry type, size, and form)? Third, we recognize that academics are unsure about how CSR should be measured (Dahlsrud, 2008). Consistent with Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, and Romi (2012), we classify CSR measurement modes into two categories: archival and self-report. We ask: Does the mode for measuring CSR in Asian research matter to our focal relationship?\n\nWe undertook this study for several critical reasons. First, both Western and local businessmen are concerned about differences between Asian and Western CSR practices and their impacts (Baughn, Bodie, & Mclntosh, 2007; Noronha, Tou, Cynthia, & Guan, 2013). Thus we study whether CSR is profitable in East Asia by combining signaling theory and the institutional theory. Second, we respond to calls for understanding institutional and other contingent factors of the CSR–performance link (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; Margolis & Walsh, 2003; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001) by investigating various moderators: economic development, industry level, firm size, firm form, and measurement issues. Third, the growing number of empirical studies regarding CSR in East Asia motivates us to extend beyond traditional narrative reviews and conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Based on meta-analytical techniques, we found 28 primary studies published between 2001 and 20152 that focus on Asian CSR practices and report CSR–performance relation statistics. We believe the time scope is appropriate to focus, review, and explore the focal relations in this unique East Asian setting.\n\nOur research contributes to CSR literature in several ways. First, previous research was limited to CSR samples mostly in Western countries. In contrast, we explore CSR in East Asia by considering both categories of CSR and the measurement of performance. The meta-analysis results have helped us cross validate insights from different studies and reconcile inconsistent findings on the relationship between CSR and business performance.\n\n1\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIA<|>GEO<|>East Asia is a region that includes countries where the study of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and their impact on business performance is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XI'AN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Xi'an Jiaotong University is an educational institution located in Xi'an, People's Republic of China, involved in research on CSR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sun Yat-Sen University is an educational institution located in Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, contributing to CSR research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shanghai International Studies University is an educational institution in Shanghai, People's Republic of China, participating in CSR studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINGJUN HOU<|>PERSON<|>Mingjun Hou is one of the authors of the study investigating CSR practices in East Asian firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENG LIU<|>PERSON<|>Heng Liu is a co-author of the study on CSR practices in East Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEIHUA FAN<|>PERSON<|>Peihua Fan is a co-author of the research paper focusing on CSR in East Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZELONG WEI<|>PERSON<|>Zelong Wei is a co-author of the study examining CSR practices in East Asian firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on society, which is the focus of the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS PERFORMANCE<|>EVENT<|>Business performance refers to the measurement of a firm's performance, which is analyzed in relation to CSR practices in the study.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XI'AN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY<|>EAST ASIA<|>Xi'an Jiaotong University conducts research on CSR practices in the East Asian context<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY<|>EAST ASIA<|>Sun Yat-Sen University is involved in CSR research relevant to East Asian firms<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY<|>EAST ASIA<|>Shanghai International Studies University contributes to the understanding of CSR in East Asia<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINGJUN HOU<|>XI'AN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY<|>Mingjun Hou is affiliated with Xi'an Jiaotong University and is a co-author of the CSR study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENG LIU<|>SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY<|>Heng Liu is affiliated with Sun Yat-Sen University and is a co-author of the CSR research<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEIHUA FAN<|>SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY<|>Peihua Fan is affiliated with Shanghai International Studies University and is a co-author of the CSR study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZELONG WEI<|>XI'AN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY<|>Zelong Wei is affiliated with Xi'an Jiaotong University and is a co-author of the CSR research<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>BUSINESS PERFORMANCE<|>The study investigates the relationship between CSR practices and business performance in East Asian firms<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
