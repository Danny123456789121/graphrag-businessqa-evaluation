Apart from the efficient aggregation of huge datasets, the method is statistically superior to other approaches for summarizing first-order meta-analyses. Conventional approaches will most likely provide inaccurate estimates of the true mean effect size and are prone to second-order sampling errors in the variances across all meta-analyses. The approach chosen considerably reduces the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows a better estimation of the true (nonartifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes (Schmidt and Oh 2013). Because of the considerable number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample which make use of artifact distribution correction, we calculate our results with the artifact distribution approach of Schmidt and Oh.\n\nIn order to differentiate whether correlations and corresponding variance are first-order (based on extracted primary studies) or second-order (aggregated vote-count studies or meta-analyses), we add one or two lines above letters for attenuated correlations r and disattenuated correlations p. The applied circumflex accent indicates that the values in the meaning of psychometric meta-analysis are estimates of the parameters, not the parameters themselves (Schmidt and Oh 2013; Schmidt and Hunter 2015, 229). Correlations containing lines above the letter but not marked with a circumflex are meta-analytical averages but are not determined using a psychometric meta-analysis.\n\n# Results\n\nFigure 2 displays our summary of findings: approximately 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation, of which 47.9% in vote-count studies and 62.6% in meta-analyses yield positive findings with a central average correlation level in studies of around 0.15. The following paragraphs discuss the findings in more detail.\n\n|share of positive findings|share of negative findings|weighted correlation level r in studies|\n|---|---|---|\n|62.6%|6.9%|0.146|\n|47.9%|8.0%|0.150|\n\nFigure 2. Overall summary results.\n\n# Summary effects: distributions\n\n# Vote-count studies\n\nIn a first step for the analysis of distribution results, all 1816 vote-count studies in the gross sample are treated as unique studies without adjusting for overlap among the vote-count studies. The overall weighted share of positive findings in the sample is calculated at 48.2%. In 41.0% of all results, the findings lead to neutral (23.0%) or mixed findings (18.0%). Just 10.7% of all analyzed studies exhibit a negative ESG–CFP relation.\n\nIn a second step, we account for the amount of nondisclosed and overlapping studies among the gross number of 1816 studies. The transparent studies are netted and in case that the first-level reviewer assessments differ, the findings are synthesized with a binomial test. The additional check does not meaningfully change the distribution of the positive and neutral findings (47.9% and 22.5%, respectively). However, a proportion of the negative findings cannot be considered statistically significant anymore if two or more reviewer interpretations are synthesized with a binomial test. The share of negative findings in the sample decreases to 6.9% of studies. Instead, the share of mixed results increases to 22.7%. Either way, depending on which of the two approaches (unadjusted gross studies/net studies adjusted with binomial test) is applied, close to 50% of all analyzed studies in the vote-count sample find a positive relation and around 10% a negative one. The small distribution difference in the results is explained by a slightly more comprehensive overall sample and the net approach for study interpretation when more than one reviewer analyzed the same primary study.\n\n# Meta-analyses\n\nOut of the 25 meta-analyses in the sample, just one study displays a summary effect size that has a negative ESG–CFP correlation – albeit very close to zero (Revelli and Viviani 2015). The sample size adjusted share of absolute positive correlation findings in meta-analytical summary effect for the 1902 studies stands with 95.8% considerably higher than in vote-count studies. However, this number is not adjusted for statistical significance. If we apply the 95% CI and 95% CrI, for the meta-analytical summary effects and the number of transparent primary studies, the figures change accordingly.\n\n|For the 25 meta-analyses, the share of positive findings is|For the 25 meta-analyses, the share of positive findings is|\n|---|\n|60%|50%|\n|48.2%/ 47.9%|40%|\n|30%|23.0% 22.5% 22.7%|\n|20%|18.0%|\n|10%|10.7%/ 6.9%|\n|0%|positive negative neutral mixed|\n|Overall sample, weighted vote-count study summary effects, n-1812|Primary studies (netted), one aggregated summary effect per study (binomial probability at the 95% level), n-723|\n\nFigure 3.
