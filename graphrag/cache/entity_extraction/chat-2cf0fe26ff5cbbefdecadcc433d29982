For example, if a hotel’s AI system recommends spa treatments to female customers or golf courses primarily to male customers, or suggests types of cuisine only to customers from specific racial or ethnic backgrounds, it would reinforce harmful stereotypes and exclusionary practices or even perpetuate unhealthy eating practices. This would not only be unethical, but it would also damage the hotel’s reputation and lead to a loss of customers.\n\n# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research\n\nanalyzes a variety of resumes for recruitment at hotels or restaurants. However, there is an ethical risk that the trained data in ChatGPT may be biased and less prone to recommend historically discriminated groups to managers or more inclined to provide lower-paying jobs to underrepresented groups. This can perpetuate discrimination and inequality in the workplace, leading to a lack of diversity and a negative impact on employee morale and job satisfaction.\n\nIn this regard, Zhuo and colleagues (2023) evaluated ChatGPT with respect to four critical ethical considerations: bias, reliability, robustness, and toxicity. While these considerations were developed in the context of a specific GAI tool (ChatGPT), they can be extrapolated to the use of GAI more broadly, as a filter for the firm’s value creation efforts. In this context, Zhuo and colleagues (2023) argue that GAI models are trained on a vast amount of data, and thus any biases (implicit and explicit) within the data can provide unfair or discriminatory arguments or suggestions toward people from different cultures and/or those who use different languages, which can affect users’ perception of fairness and lead to a lack of inclusivity. It is important to highlight that the current GAI technology is based on existing databases, which might have limitations on diverse and inclusive perspectives in decision-making and communications (Dwivedi et al., 2023a). Hence, discrimination toward customers and employees may potentially be experienced due to this limitation.\n\nFurthermore, another crucial ethical concern associated with GAI is robustness, defined as “a model’s ability to maintain its performance when given input that is semantically (the meaning of input) or syntactically (the structure of input) different from the input it was trained on” (Zhuo et al., 2023, p. 3). As an example, ChatGPT can be used by international tourists as a language translator. In such cases, ChatGPT must accurately translate new sentences, although the language used is unfamiliar. For instance, if ChatGPT was trained in the formal French language, it should still be able to accurately translate informal “slang” sentences.\n\nZhuo and colleagues (2023) further postulate that reliability and toxicity is a critical ethical issue related to GAI. First, disseminating false, misleading, misconstrued, or outdated information can contribute to forming conspiracy theories that cause harm and lead to poor decision-making. Often, language models such as ChatGPT can even fabricate sources that do not actually exist. Thus, for example, ChatGPT can manipulate online reviews of hotels or restaurants or mass-create thousands of accounts with false identities. Second, the concern is those models can generate or comprehend harmful or offensive content while interacting with users. For instance, if the GAI used in applications such as customer service chatbots or voice assistants in hotel rooms is trained on datasets that contain racist, sexist, or pornographic content, it can lead to the generation of offensive and harmful communication when interacting with guests. Relatedly, users may attempt to “jailbreak” a GAI application into producing toxic content. For example, a guest could co-create a conversation that tricks the AI into using words or engaging in conversation involving racial slurs (Hachman, 2023) or outright lies (Carter, 2023), which may open the doors to legal consequences.\n\n# Financial Considerations\n\nThe use of GAI by HT companies will involve significant financial implications and considerations. Managers need to implement a rigorous cost-benefit analysis before adopting AI technologies, including GAI applications (Ivanov & Webster, 2018). In terms of direct costs, the use of third-party GAI is associated with monthly or annual subscription fees to access the application. These can range significantly—from a few tens of dollars per month to a few thousand per month, depending on the capabilities of the application, the requirements of the organization (and, relatedly, any specifications or modifications) and the competition on the GAI market. Some AI providers, such as ChatGPT give free access to their GAI application for a limited period or for a limited number of generated images/words/symbols. This freemium option allows users to get acquainted with and test the product before they subscribe to it, which decreases the perceived risk of purchase of the premium options. Other indirect costs relate to the investment needed to train the GAI application(s) with the company’s data to allow it to provide specific solutions to the company’s needs and to train employees to use the applications effectively.\n\nIn terms of benefits, GAI can improve the profitability of HT companies in several ways. First, it can save costs associated with purchasing photos from databases, text copywriting, and hiring professional actors to appear in ads and read text, among others. The integration of GAI (e.g., ChatGPT) into a chatbot can improve its efficiency in interacting with customers and decrease the need for human employees to intervene, thus reducing labor costs. Of course, the current level of development of GAI has not reached the point where it can deliver output with error-free quality. In fact, the generated output (text, photo, etc.) may be incorrect, not relevant, or not specific enough, thus sometimes requiring human intervention. However, the more human-like interactions with a GAI-based chatbot as compared to other chatbots may have a direct positive impact on\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
