Despite having extensive policy frameworks to ensure sustainable corporate practices, their implementation is grossly missing. According to crude estimates, a few percent of the businesses truly execute the CS policies. Many organizations do greenwashing by showing some charity and environmental driven steps (Ramus and Montiel 2005). It raises a serious question of whether the CS policies are overambitious or the organizations are reluctant to implement them (Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2010).\n\nJanaina et al. (2020) argued that decision-makers must understand local management practices and concepts instead of imposing challenging requirements on local companies and society. The growing demand for eco-friendly products invites the textile companies to search for diverse environmental instruments to fulfill the demand of customers who look for a sustainable product. In this way, companies can sustainably gain a premium price to enhance profit in a promising way (Hayat et al. 2020).\n\nThere may be some other factors due to which the CS policies may not be translated into actions. The present study undertakes this task by comprehensively reviewing the literature on CS policies to draw the reasons for the literature’s lack of implementation. This study contributes to the much-needed debate of the gap between CS policies and their implementation. The study also contributes by providing the steps that can be instrumental in implementing CS policies. The subsequent section of the paper briefly entails the methodology adopted for the review.\n\n# Material and method\n\nThe early research on sustainability started in the year 1950s (such as Bowen 1953). Therefore, we selected the studies published between the 1950 to 2020 period for this comprehensive review. We developed ten keywords to search the articles related to CS (see Table 1). The various combinations of these keywords were used to query the research articles from selected six databases (see Table 1). In the first search, 1224 papers were downloaded using the keywords or their combinations. After reading the titles, 845 research papers were retained as the rest of the papers were not directly linked with CS, CS policies and/or its implementation. In the second phase, abstracts of all 845 papers read and 107 articles were retained for the final review. The yearly detail of the article.\n\n|Keywords|Publishers|\n|---|---|\n|Policy|Taylor and Francis|\n|Small and medium enterprise (SMEs)|Wiley Online|\n|Sustainability|Springer|\n|CSR|Sage|\n|Corporate social responsibility|Emerald|\n|Corporate sustainability|Elsevier|\n|Corporate ethics| |\n|Corporate philanthropy| |\n|Corporate citizenship| |\n|Corporate sustainability responsibility| |\n\nGovernance appeared as a significant study area in all six publishers; education and SMEs appeared as the second most essential study areas, followed by innovation, urban studies, EU policies, research, and innovation financial and fiscal studies.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it is imperative to discuss the different terminologies, which addresses CS’s concept. Researchers use interchangeable terminologies, such as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate philanthropy, corporate social performance, socially responsible behavior, corporate ethics, stakeholders management, corporate accountability to reflect the sustainability of a firm (Ahmed and Ahmed 2011; Barron 2010; Helleno et al. 2017; Miska et al. 2018; Pedersen 2006; Sheinbaum-Pardo et al. 2012). The stated terminologies represent the tri-dimensional concept of CS, including social, environmental, and economic dimensions. We use term CS in this paper to reflect the sustainability of a firm.\n\n# Table 2 Articles year-wise and publisher-wise, selected for review of abstract\n\n|Year|Wiley Online|Taylor and
