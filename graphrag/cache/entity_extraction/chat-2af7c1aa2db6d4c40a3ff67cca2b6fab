One party credibly conveys information of quality and shows the unobservable attributes of itself to another party with the purpose of gaining a premium (Spence, 1973). While intent information can help parties reduce the possible moral hazards that result from the behavior of the individuals or organizations during the transaction (Su, Peng, Tan, & Chueng, 2014). Spence’s (1973) job market signaling model illustrates that the potential employees can send an observable signal (e.g., college diploma and qualification certificate) to firms to show their unobservable characteristics (working ability). Based on these perceptions, CSR scholars have adopted signaling theory to examine the potential value of CSR practices in management research (Montiel, Husted, & Christmann, 2012; Ramchander, Schwebach, & Staking, 2012; Su et al., 2014; Turban & Greening, 1996). For instance, Su et al. (2014) argued that the process of signal transmission can avoid asymmetric information between firms and investors. Therefore, firms adopting CSR practices can send unobservable characteristics (attitude towards social and environmental issues) to investors in capital markets. King, Lenox, and Terlaak (2005) argued that Environmental Management Standard ISO 14000 transfer a green signal conveying organization’s attitude towards environment and other unobservable information to the outside individuals and organizations. Particularly, the phenomenon of information asymmetries will decrease when organizations sending green signals or other private management certification (King et al., 2005). As an unobservable attribute of organization, CSR practices can play the roles of green and good signals that provide important information to stakeholders, especially in the Asian context (Su et al., 2014). Although CSR practices may cause financial costs and other implicit costs (e.g., management costs), the costs will ultimately pay off when organizations have “stakeholder influence capacity” (Barnett, 2007). The ability is difficult for low-capability competitors to imitate because this ability is built over time through heavily investments (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). CSR practices can help firms improve the relationships with stakeholders and obtain this capacity.\n\n# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?\n\n# Institutional theory\n\nCSR has become a popular topic in the management literature, but has neglected the importance of institutional environments to a great extent (Brammer, Jackson, & Matten, 2012). Institutional theory mainly focuses on the external system environment, such as social, political, and economic systems, that surround organizations and grant them legitimacy status (North, 1990). Firm’s reactions to external institutional pressures may range from active conformity to passive resistance, depending on the specific circumstance and nature of the pressures (Oliver, 1991). In the mid-2000s, several studies used institutional theory as a core conceptual lens to explain CSR-related problems (Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, & Ganapathi, 2007; Campbell, 2011; Matten & Moon, 2008). Institutional theory allows scholars to get a better understanding of CSR in two ways: the heterogeneity of CSR and the dynamics of CSR. On the issue of heterogeneity, several scholars attempted to explore the cross-national differences of CSR from the lens of institutional theory (Blasco & Zolner, 2010; Gjolberg, 2009; Jackson, 2010). They found the value of CSR practices in different countries and regions is contingent on the different institutional environments (Deakin & Whittaker, 2007; Doh & Guay, 2006). Institutional environments here not only includes the formal institutions (e.g., laws, rules, and regulations), but also the informal institutions (e.g., religion, guanxi, and custom). On another issue of dynamics, business ethics scholars attempt to explore the changes of concepts, values, and mechanism of CSR (Brammer et al., 2012). For instance, the core content of CSR has changed through adaptation and emulation by organizations outside the Western institutional system. Institutional theory plays an important role for explaining the dynamics of CSR. In this study, we employ signaling theory and institutional theory combined as our overarching theoretical viewpoints to explain the CSR–performance link and related contingent influences.\n\n# CSR and business performance in East Asia\n\n“After more than thirty years of research, we cannot clearly conclude whether a one dollar investment in social initiatives returns more or less than one dollar in benefit to the shareholder” (Barnett, 2007: 794).\n\nOne question in the lasting debate about business ethics is whether it is worthwhile for firms to engage in CSR practice, especially from the financial perspective. Business scholars generally find a positive relationship between CSR and firm performance, while economic scholars sometimes find a negative or non-significant effect (Su et al., 2014). According to signaling theory, CSR practices can send positive signal to customers, suppliers, government, and other stakeholders. This CSR signal contains several unobservable characteristics (e.g., attitude towards the society) that make firms capable of reducing risks, filling institutional deficiency, and improving stakeholders’ relationships (Miller, Lee, Chang, & Le Breton-Miller, 2009; Porter & Kramer, 2006; Rivoli & Waddock, 2011). After receiving the signal, relevant stakeholders may provide premiums to organizations if these stakeholders value the above unobservable characteristics (Ramchander et al., 2012; Spence, 1973). The CSR signal can gain support to meet stakeholder demands, prevent costly conflicts, improve stakeholder relationships, and enhance business performance. In other words, better CSR could be the difference that would improve employee satisfaction, corporate reputation, and\n\nM.
