This view is based on the argument that socially responsible ﬁrms are economically in a more disadvantageous position than those who are less responsible as a result of the cost incurred by the former for their socially responsible actions (Preston and O’Bannon, 1997; Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullmann, 1985; Vance, 1975; Preston and O’Bannon, 1997). The second view, which is in sharp contrast to the\n\nVOL. 8 NO. 2 2012 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j PAGE 243\n\nFirst, is that a firm may benefit from being socially responsible as it leads to increased employee morale and improved productivity (Moskowitz, 1972; Parket and Eilbirt, 1975). The cost of social responsibility may be high but can be offset by the reductions in other firm costs such as legal expenses, worker compensation costs, product replacement costs and the like (Herremans et al., 1993). A further contemporary view strongly suggests that there is a nexus between CSR and competitive advantage in terms of building a unique image of the firm in the market. A firm can build this image through CSR orientation and use that unique image as a differentiated strategy to increase its competitiveness in the market over non-CSR oriented firms (Porter and Krammer, 2004).\n\nThere is also a CSR perspective rooted in the moral principle which suggests that corporations should be socially responsible simply because it is the right thing to do irrespective of the financial outcome of that socially responsible action. This perspective is underpinned by deontological philosophy, which assesses an action or behaviour in terms of its inherent rightness or wrongness and does not take into account the nature and extent of outcome of that action (Frankena, 1973).\n\nOverall, the literature on the relationship between CSR and CFP is inconclusive. Several issues have been held responsible for the lack of a consensus. These include inconsistent methodologies (Griffin and Mahon, 1997), misspecification of models (Ullmann, 1985), inclusion of confounding factors (Margolis and Walsh, 2003), and the lack of clarity of both CSR (Griffin, 2000) and CFP (Margolis and Walsh, 2003) variables. Ullmann (1985) summarised the findings of 12 studies as showing no clear tendency. A mixture of positive, negative and no correlation outcomes were observed. The findings regarding the relationship between social responsibility and financial performance ranged from no correlation to various significant positive or negative linear relationships (Ullmann, 1985).\n\nOrlitzky et al. (2003) included 52 papers published from 1974 to 1999 and found a similar pattern of outcomes. Mill (2006) lists six meta-analyses from 1995-2005, spanning articles published from 1970 to 2002. It is to be noted here that there does not appear to be any research to date on the existence of possible curvilinear relationships.\n\nMost studies of the relationship between CSR and CFP have used a regression model, correlation analysis, or a t-test. Only a few papers have used a different methodology. For example, Mill (2006) adopted a mixture of a case-control study and a longitudinal study over a four-year period and found that firms with a positive commitment to CSR recorded better financial outcomes as compared to those with no commitment to CSR. This implies that firms that have invested in CSR in programs have, in financial terms, achieved a higher level of gains.\n\nWu (2006) conducted a meta-analysis of 121 papers that were published prior to 2000 using subset analyses by definition of CSR, definition of CFP and firm size. In general Wu found a positive relationship between CSR and CFP. Wu also found that the relationship between CSR and CFP tended to weaken when analysis was conducted by the subgroups mentioned above. In a discussion paper, Chand (2006) pointed to an important issue by advocating the use of industry as a factor.\n\nMost of the findings reported in the literature suggest that the correlation between corporate social responsibility and financial performance is generally positive. However, it would not be wise to conclude that the tendency is towards a positive relationship. There are a number of reasons for this reservation. These include the identification of CSR as an “elusive concept” (Lee, 1987) and the use of “poor experiments, unfortunate use of proxies, inappropriate mathematics or controls, and so forth” (Cottrill, 1990).\n\n# 3. The rationale, scope and objectives of the research\n\nFollowing the recent collapse of a number of corporations at the international level, ethics and CSR have attracted the renewed attention of boardroom barons as well as other stakeholders such as investors, creditors, legislators, politicians and the general public. While numerous aspects of CSR and ethics have been addressed in the contemporary business literature, a vital question remains unresolved. That is, to link the effects of being ethical and socially responsible to the financial performance of firms. The main reason\n\nbehind the difﬁculty of ﬁnding a clear-cut answer to the question is that research in this area has used a variety of methodologies, measurement scales and statistical methods. This has made the results debatable, and consequently no consensus has been reached. In response, some authors such as Orlitzky et al. (2003) attempted to resolve the issue using meta-analyses of results.\n\nIn view of the above, this paper is aimed towards contributing to the arrival of a possible consensus on this issue. In reaching towards the aim we have employed a sub-group meta-analysis of the results of the studies identiﬁed by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
