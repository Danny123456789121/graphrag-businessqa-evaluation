(2015), the company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability (Amacha & Dastane, 2017; Tabash, 2019). The result shows that the majority of oil and gas companies in Malaysia had poor performance in terms of sustainability disclosure. On all three chosen profitability parameters, the companies that practiced sustainability were found to perform better than their counterparts that did not. Strong and significant relationship exists between sustainability practices and better financial performance. Financial performance is an achievement assessment of a company that can be seen from the company’s ability to generate profits. Financial performance is a company work achievement that has been achieved by the company in a certain period and contained in the company’s financial statements, so that one of the information that can be known by interested parties or users of financial statements to find out corporate profits (Pujiasih, 2013). Financial ratios connect various estimates contained in financial statements so that the financial condition and results of operations of a company can be interpreted (Lucyanda & Siagian, 2012; Angelia & Suryaningsih, 2015; Manurung & Rachmat, 2019; Manurung et al., 2020). Financial accountability is an accurate and precise focus on reporting about the use of public funds. The main purpose is to ensure that public funds have been used for objectives that have been established efficiently and effectively (Atmadja & Saputra, 2018).\n\n# 2.4. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\n\nAccounting, especially green accounting, is expected to be able to support the sustainable development of the company. Green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The company’s ability to apply green accounting in its business scope is expected to be able to manage costs related to the environment and, in the end, the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.\n\nH1: Green accounting implementation is able to improve CSMS implementation.\n\n# 2.5. Green Accounting in Financial Performance\n\nWhen a company applies green accounting and is able to show a good environmental performance, the impact is on good financial performance. This has been proven in both academic and empirical research, which states that financial performance, in this case the market value of the company, is strongly influenced by environmental performance, where the effect is positive. The relationship between environmental performance and financial performance can be observed in terms of income and costs. From the income side, it can be explained that consumer preference for consumer-oriented products allows these companies to enjoy market differentiation, competitive advantages, and consumers have a tendency to be willing to pay higher prices for environmentally-oriented products (premium prices). On the cost side, there are many benefits that\n\n# I Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\n\nCompanies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. Thus, it can be explained through disclosure of environmental costs, that it will reflect the business ethics carried out by the company, as well as responsible management of resources. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability. According to Dutta et al. (2019) stated that green accounting issues relate to corporate profitability.\n\n# H2: The implementation of green accounting is able to improve the financial performance.\n\n# 2.6. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance\n\nWhen integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values. It is necessary to set up corporate governance, which incorporates a positive response to the company’s social, economic and environmental risks and opportunities that have a potential to influence performance of the organization.\n\n# H3: Implementing a CMS can improve financial performance.\n\n# 3. Research Methodology\n\nThe population in this study was 154 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) for the 2018-2019 period. This study took a sample of publicly-traded companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management (PROPER) for 2018-2019. Purposive sampling was used, so a research sample of 38 companies was selected. The data analysis tool uses the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The currently drawn sample fulfills the required characteristics. In general, these characteristics are as follows:\n\n1. The sample companies engaged in manufacturing that go public and are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and publish financial reports (annual reports) in 2018-2019.\n2. The companies selected as samples were manufacturing companies that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management for 2018-2019.\n\nThe number of samples of PROPER companies in the period 2018 to 2019 was 38 companies, so that the number of observations was 76,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
