Hugh Son, “Morgan Stanley is testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot for its 16,000 financial advisors,” CNBC, March 14, 2023.\n\n# Production of tailored content at scale\n\nGenerative AI tools can draw on existing documents and data sets to substantially streamline content generation. These tools can create personalized marketing and sales content tailored to specific client profiles and histories as well as a multitude of alternatives for A/B testing. In addition, generative AI could automatically produce model documentation, identify missing documentation, and scan relevant regulatory updates to create alerts for relevant shifts.\n\n# Factors for banks to consider\n\nWhen exploring how to integrate generative AI into operations, banks can be mindful of a number of factors:\n\n- The level of regulation for different processes. These vary from unregulated processes such as customer service to heavily regulated processes such as credit risk scoring.\n- Intended level of work automation. AI agents integrated through APIs could act nearly autonomously or as copilots, giving real-time suggestions to agents during customer interactions.\n- Data constraints. While public data such as annual reports could be made widely available, there would need to be limits on identifiable details for customers and other internal data.\n- Type of end user. End users vary widely in their expectations and familiarity with generative AI.\n\nA generative AI bot trained on proprietary knowledge such as policies, research, and customer interaction could provide always-on, deep technical support.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier 29\n\n# Spotlight: Pharmaceuticals and medical products\n\nGenerative AI deployment could unlock potential value equal to 2.6 to 4.5 percent of annual revenues across the pharmaceutical and medical-product industries. Our analysis finds that generative AI could have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical and medical-product industries—from $60 billion to $110 billion annually. This big potential reflects the resource-intensive process of discovering new drug compounds. Pharma companies typically spend approximately 20 percent of revenues on R&D, and the development of a new drug takes an average of ten to 15 years.\n\nWith this level of spending and timeline, improving the speed and quality of R&D can generate substantial value. For example, lead identification—a step in the drug discovery process in which researchers identify a molecule that would best address the target for a potential new drug—can take several months even with “traditional” deep learning techniques. Foundation models and generative AI can enable organizations to complete this step in a matter of weeks.\n\n# Enhance indication finding\n\nAn important phase of drug discovery involves the identification and prioritization of new indications—that is, diseases, symptoms, or circumstances that justify the use of a specific medication or other treatment, such as a test, procedure, or surgery. Possible indications for a given drug are based on a patient group’s clinical history and medical records, and they are then prioritized based on their similarities to established and evidence-backed indications.\n\nResearchers start by mapping the patient cohort’s clinical events and medical histories—including potential diagnoses, prescribed medications, and performed procedures—from real-world data. Using foundation models, researchers can quantify clinical events, establish relationships, and measure the similarity between the patient cohort and evidence-backed indications. The result is a short list of indications that have a better probability of success in clinical trials because they can be more accurately matched to appropriate patient groups.\n\n# Generative AI use cases aligned to industry needs\n\nDrug discovery involves narrowing the universe of possible compounds to those that could effectively treat specific conditions. Generative AI’s ability to process massive amounts of data and model options can accelerate output across several use cases:\n\n# Improve automation of preliminary screening\n\nIn the lead identification stage of drug development, scientists can use foundation models to automate the preliminary screening of chemicals in the search for those that will produce specific effects on drug targets. To start, thousands of cell cultures are tested and paired with images of the corresponding experiments.\n\n# Additional factors to consider\n\nBefore integrating generative AI into operations, pharma executives should be aware of some factors that could limit their ability to capture its benefits:\n\n- The need for a human in the loop. Companies may need to implement new quality checks on processes that shift from humans to generative AI, such as representative-generated emails, or more detailed quality checks on AI-assisted processes, such as drug discovery. The increasing need to verify whether generated content is based on fact or inference elevates the need for a new level of quality control.\n- Explainability. A lack of transparency into the origins of generated content and traceability of root data could make it difficult to update models and scan them for potential risks; for instance, a generative AI solution for synthesizing scientific literature may not be able to point to the specific articles or quotes that led it to infer that a new treatment is very popular among physicians. The technology can also “hallucinate,” or generate responses that are obviously incorrect or inappropriate for the context. Systems need to be designed to point to specific articles or data sources, and then do human-in-the-loop checking.\n- Privacy considerations. Generative AI’s use of clinical images and medical records could increase the risk that protected health information will leak, potentially violating regulations that require pharma companies to protect patient privacy.\n\n1 Research and development in the pharmaceutical industry, Congressional Budget Office, April 2021.\n\n# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nIn this chapter, we have estimated the organizational value generative AI could deliver through use cases across industries and business functions, but the technology’s potential is much greater. As it is embedded into tools used by every knowledge worker, its additional impact may be more diffuse but no less valuable than that associated with these use cases. Companies need to find ways to maximize the value created by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
