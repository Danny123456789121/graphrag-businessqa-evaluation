Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes, we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—and explore how differences between them in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. We explain how the two frames lead to differences in the breadth and depth of scanning, differences in issue interpretations in terms of sense of control and issue valence, and different types of responses that managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. By considering alternative cognitive frames, our argument contributes to a better understanding of managerial decision making regarding ambiguous sustainability issues, and it develops the underlying cognitive determinants of the stance that managers adopt on sustainability issues. This argument offers a cognitive explanation for why managers rarely push for radical change when faced with complex and ambiguous issues, such as sustainability, that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.\n\nCorporate sustainability requires managers to simultaneously address widely diverging but interconnected concerns for the natural environment, social welfare, and economic prosperity (Bansal, 2002; Gladwin, Kennelly, & Krause, 1995; Maon, Lindgreen, & Swaen, 2008). As a consequence, corporate decision makers “face a great deal of ambiguity in understanding the issues, the implications of these issues for their organizations, and ways to respond to these issues” (Sharma, 2000: 683). The question of how managers make sense of such ambiguous cues from their organizational context has increasingly been addressed from a cognitive perspective (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). Through cognitive frames, which act as “cognitive filters that admit certain bits of information into the strategizing process while excluding others” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178), managers imbue ambiguous cues with meaning, which leads them to consider specific strategic responses (Weick, 1995).\n\nSeveral authors have applied a cognitive lens to the analysis of corporate sustainability and related concepts, such as corporate social responsibility or corporate citizenship (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma, Pablo, & Vredenburg, 1999).\n\nWe thank associate editor Peer Fiss for his clear guidance throughout the review process, as well as three anonymous reviewers for their most constructive feedback and suggestions.\n\nCopyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

In particular, the strong focus on business case thinking (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) that permeates research on corporate sustainability (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn, Figge, Pinkse, & Preuss, 2010) has resulted in a situation where managerial responses to sustainability issues are conceptualized along an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000) dominated by economic objectives of the firm. In contrast, our aim is to generate a better understanding of the underlying cognitive determinants of different responses to sustainability issues that managers consider.\n\nDrawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—to explore how differences in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas, Clark, & Gioia, 1993). The two frames are based on contrasting views of the relationship between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability and result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues. We propose that managers with a business case frame focus on environmental and social aspects that align with economic objectives and, thus, interpret sustainability issues univalently as either positive or negative for their business; hence, they adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues, with a propensity to pursue narrow but workable responses along existing routines and solutions. In contrast, with their awareness of multiple and conflicting economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame develop more ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues; as a consequence, they adopt a prudent stance, where they consider more comprehensive responses, but because of their higher awareness of risk and tensions, they move forward slowly and carefully.\n\nAs our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making by considering the effects of alternative cognitive frames on the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
