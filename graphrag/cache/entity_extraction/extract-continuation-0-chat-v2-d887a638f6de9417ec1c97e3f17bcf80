Mathis (2007) examined the CS policy implementation in the dairy sector of the Netherland. He drew three inferences from the result of the study. First, he identified that a higher level of stakeholder management with the help of CS engagement allows business organizations to create a closer link with public authorities. Second, he identified that stakeholders influence the policymaking process. Third, the proactive approach towards CS policy in the private sector leads to self-regulation.\n\n# Normative references\n\nKehbila et al. (2010) examined the state of environmental policy implementation in the South African Automotive Industry. Their study revealed that the South African Government was concerned for the country’s environmental condition, due to loss of biodiversity, land, disposal of waste, deterioration of air quality, noise pollution, and degradation of the marine environment. Kehbila et al. (2010) reported that large and SME sizes of automobile companies are operating in South Africa, and all are committed to maintaining the sustainability matters of automobile sectors. Results revealed that companies have ISO 14001 certification, ISO 9001 quality audit (external and internal), which includes SMEs. Dankova et al. (2015) explained three levels and types of standards being initiated/practices internationally, i.e., (i) sustainability standard based on political wills, such as UNGS, OECD ME, OECD CG, and GSC, (ii) CS standard based on professional judgment, such as SA8000 and ISO 26000, and (iii) CS reporting standards, such as GRI and EFFAS KPIs.\n\n# SustainablełDevelopmentłGoals Guidelines\n\n|Macro-Institutions|(SectorłSpecific)|\n|---|---|\n|Policy·········Laws······Leadership········Support·|Definitional Issues|\n|Meso-Institution| |\n|Policy·|Laws·Defining|\n|Leadership·······Support···Guidance|Definitional·Issues|\n\n# TriplełBottomłLine\n\nTriłDimensionalłConceptłof CorporatełSustainability\n\nSocial Dimension\nEconomic Dimension\nEnvironmental Dimension\n# OutcomełofłCorporatełSustainabilityłPolicyłandłImplementation\n\n# Fig. 2\n\nSchematic snapshot of scholastic work on corporate sustainability.
