The study uses the meta-analysis instrument developed by Hunter et al. (1982).\n\nFindings – The investigation finds a significant positive association between board size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility with Corporate Social Disclosures (CSD). Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership are insignificantly and positively associated with CSD. CEO duality is also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study further investigates that the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study.\n\nOriginality/value – This paper adds significance to the extant academic literature as well as assisting the appropriate policy maker in assessing the determinants of corporate social disclosures from the viewpoints of corporate governance. It further aims to reconcile the findings of the previous studies around the world, and also for the developed and developing countries separately.\n\nKeywords: Corporate social responsibility, Disclosures, Corporate governance, Meta-analysis.\n\nPaper type: Research paper\n\n1 | P a g e\n\nEmerald Publishing Limited\n\nThis is a pre-print of a paper and is subject to change before publication.

Introduction\n\nDue to several corporate scandals (for example, Enron, Ahold, WorldCom, Lehman Brothers and Parmalat), recent financial crisis, and changing the mix of the business environment with the rising demand from various stakeholders have brought more devotion to the corporate governance (CG) and corporate social disclosures (CSD). Corporate governance and social disclosures are related to each other (Haniffa and Cooke, 2005, Said et al., 2009, Kathy Rao et al., 2012). CG ensures the interest of the shareholders, and it plays a vital role to the corporate accountability by disclosing social issues (Hossain and Alam, 2016). Dellaportas et al. (2012) find if the disclosure level of the organization increases, it will create advantages for that organization. As a result, every company should disclose their economic, social and environmental activities to their valuable stakeholders (Said et al., 2009).\n\nThe meaning of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CSD differ in the context of various stakeholder groups and companies around the world (Dawkins and Lewis, 2003, Igalens and Gond, 2005, Welford et al., 2008). As a country, USA is the pioneer in the arena of CSR and CSD (Giannarakis, 2014b) and companies in that country still meets the desire of their shareholders by providing CSD as a voluntary disclosure (Tschopp, 2005, Rodríguez and LeMaster, 2007). The evidence shows that a number of research connected to CSD have investigated in the developed and developing countries. But, much of the evidence of previous literature provides qualitative descriptions regarding the nature, contents and motivational factors of CSD (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001, Newson and Deegan, 2002, Campbell, 2007, Van Beurden and Gössling, 2008, Uzma, 2016, Neu et al., 1998, Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975, Teoh and Thong,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
