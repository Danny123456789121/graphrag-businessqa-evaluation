Our model is based on a multiple linear regression where sample size is a scale variable, time is a categorical variable measured in five-year intervals, and method is a categorical variable in two categories.\n\nOnce the regression model has been fitted using least squares in SPSS, it is possible to carry out an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the relative importance of sample size, year, and method in determining effect size. The ANOVA based on the optimistic positive effect sizes is shown in Table VI.\n\nThe p-values in the last column of Table VI shows that the effect of time (five-year intervals) is not significant (p = 0.4187). However the effect of sample size is significant at the 5 per cent level (p = 0.0142), and the effect of method is also significant at the 5 per cent level (p = 0.0157). We therefore suggest that more attention be paid to increasing the sample size and choosing a powerful statistical method when designing future research on CSR.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Orlitzky (2001) studied whether the association between CSR and CFP is caused by the confounding effect of firm size. The author found that controlling for firm size still results in a positive association between CSR and CFP. Also, Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) subdivided a meta-analysis by definition of CSR and definition of CFP. They operationalised CFP as firm risk and then further subdivided that into accounting risk and market risk. They subdivided CSR into CSP disclosures, CSP reputation indices and socials audits as well as CSR1 (see notes to Table I).\n\n# Table VI\n\n# Analysis of variance\n\n|Source|df|Sum of squares|Mean square|F-value|p-value|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Sample size|1|0.4769|0.4679|6.5365|0.0142|\n|Time (five-year intervals)|5|0.3716|0.0743|1.0186|0.4187|\n|Method|1|0.4618|0.4618|6.3289|0.0157|\n\nVOL. 8 NO. 2 2012 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j PAGE 249\n\n# 7. Discussion and implications\n\nThis paper has reported on three additional aspects of the relationship between CSR and CFP not explicitly covered by Orlitzky et al. (2003). We based our meta-analyses on Orlitzky et al. (2003) in order to maintain consistency with their work so that any additional findings can contribute to furthering our understanding of the elements that are causing the variation. We therefore expect that our work will prompt further research into the factors influencing the effect size on CSR and CFP. The three additional factors reported in this paper were sample size, year of publication and statistical methodology. Our meta-analysis revealed sample size and statistical methodology to be important sources of variation in the relationship between CSR and CFP followed by year of publication.\n\nCombining sample size and statistical methodology suggests that the overall study design is an important factor influencing study effect. An implication of this is that a structural framework of the relationship between CSR and CFP and the variables that may moderate and mediate such a relationship may be effective in capturing many aspects of the relationship. An initial interpretation of the results of our meta analysis provide some important clues as to a possible structural framework capturing some important aspects of CSR and their outcomes in terms of some specification of financial performance. These specifications include variables such as profit, market share, share price, ROI and so on.\n\nResearch has also found culture to be a possible moderating factor (Pesqueux, 2005; Maignan, 2001; Quazi and O’Brien, 2000). Marom (2006) proposes a mathematical model and also suggests some mediating variables including the level of corporate reputation, the degree of business risk and the level of support of regulatory bodies. Peters and Mullen (2009) include firm size and industry as variables in their model of CSR and CFP. These variables are also considered critical, as they are likely to affect the level of CFP. Industry type and national cultures are also considered instrumental in understanding the relationship between CSR and CFP and these variables have been picked up by prior studies (Kim and Kim, 2010; Vitell et al., 2003; Maignan, 2001; Quazi and O’Brien, 2000). However, whether some other moderating or mediating factors would be relevant in the realm of the relationship is the subject of more comprehensive future studies.\n\nIn order to set up the proposed framework, new data would be needed in order to broaden our understanding of the complexities of the relationship in the context of the dynamism of the issues of CSR and CFP. For example, the current global financial crisis is about to upset much conventional wisdom that has dominated academic thought over the past half century since the global depression of the 1930s. Therefore, we are keen to extend the framework in terms of time scale into the last ten years (2000-2009) and beyond in our next study. This would then update and advance the knowledge beyond what Orlitzky et al. (2003) covered in their studies for the period 1974-1999. We would also be keen to study the effect of national culture on effect size. The current studies are exclusively based in the USA, and there has been considerable work in the past few years in the context of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky is an author who studied the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENJAMIN<|>PERSON<|>Benjamin is an author who collaborated with Orlitzky on studies related to CSR and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to practices and policies undertaken by corporations to have a positive influence on the world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) measures a company's financial performance and profitability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPSS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SPSS is a software used for statistical analysis, including regression models and ANOVA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOL. 8 NO. 2 2012<|>EVENT<|>This refers to the publication of a paper in the Social Responsibility Journal discussing the relationship between CSR and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS<|>EVENT<|>The global financial crisis refers to the severe worldwide economic crisis that occurred in the late 2000s, affecting many aspects of financial performance and corporate practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>CSR<|>Orlitzky studied the association between CSR and CFP, contributing to the understanding of their relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>CFP<|>Orlitzky's research focused on the impact of CSR on Corporate Financial Performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENJAMIN<|>ORLITZKY<|>Benjamin collaborated with Orlitzky on studies regarding CSR and CFP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSR<|>CFP<|>CSR practices are believed to influence Corporate Financial Performance<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPSS<|>ANOVA<|>SPSS is used to conduct ANOVA to analyze the relationship between sample size, year, and method in determining effect size<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOL. 8 NO. 2 2012<|>CSR<|>The paper published in this volume discusses the relationship between CSR and CFP<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOL. 8 NO. 2 2012<|>CFP<|>The paper published in this volume discusses the relationship between CSR and CFP<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS<|>CSR<|>The global financial crisis may impact the practices and perceptions of CSR<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS<|>CFP<|>The global financial crisis significantly affects Corporate Financial Performance<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
