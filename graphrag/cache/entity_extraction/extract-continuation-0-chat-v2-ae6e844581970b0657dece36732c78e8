Wang and Juslin (2009), for example, based on their literature study on terms of differences between the West and East contexts, claim that Western corporate sustainability concepts do not adapt well to the Chinese market, because they have rarely defined the primary reason for corporate sustainability. The ethic approach to the corporate sustainability concept does not take the Chinese reality and culture into consideration. They point out that corporate sustainability is a term that may be legitimately interpreted within the Chinese corporate culture. However, Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasise the “cultivation of virtue and morality, as well\n\nas the core of its harmony notion” (Wang and Juslin, 2009, p. 446), offer a better understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context. Accordingly, there may be some of the indicators listed on GRI guidelines that are not relevant within the Chinese context, and hence, they are not considered as necessary by the Chinese report users. This study tries to evaluate whether it is indeed some differences in the way Chinese report users’ perceived level of importance of sustainability information indicators listed in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines than what are intended by the GRI by including the indicators in the GRI guidelines.\n\nIn this study, we use a Likert scale of 4 being “important” as the basis GRI score for each of the GRI indicators and compare it with the respondents’ mean values for each of the relevant indicators. A t-test is used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores, which indicates whether Chinese report users perceive the level of importance of sustainability information in GRI guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.\n\n# 3. Methodology\n\n# 3.1 Questionnaire design\n\nBillings and Halstead (2005) suggested that one of the best ways to obtain information about beliefs, behaviours, views and perceptions of individuals in the business world is to ask questions with closed ends. In this study, a Web-based questionnaire was designed based on sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The scale of GRI has been validated by Chow and Chen (2012), in which corporate sustainability construct was modelled in social, environmental and economic dimensions.\n\nTo verify the measurement scale, they adopted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modelling and confirmed the validity of the proposed GRI model. While Chow and Chen (2012) address the partial concerns of the validity of GRI from the preparer’s end, their results are limited to interpret the perception from the report users. According to Brown and Deegan (1998), materiality within the sustainability report is used to be the way of potential organisational financial risks by address concerns from various stakeholders. It is imperative to consider corporate sustainability also from the report users’ perception.\n\nIn our data collection, each respondent was asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. A five-point Likert scale was used because the scale is considered suitable to provide sufficient discrimination for most purposes and can be easily understood by respondents (Brace, 2004).\n\njSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j\n\nAs the questionnaire was designed based on the structure of GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, there were 11 questions about environmental disclosure, 4 questions about economic disclosure and 28 questions about social disclosure. The questions were translated into Chinese with the assistance of professional translators. To ensure the accuracy of the translation, we wrote emails to the first 30 respondents who left their contact details at the end in our pilot study. We asked about their understanding of our questionnaires with the Chinese version of GRI attached. Overall the respondents found the questionnaires are well written, and we decided to continue the full sample data collection. Discrepancies, reliability and validity were studied and tested in a pilot test, which involved 30 financial analysts from China. Appropriate adjustments were made to suit the terms used in China and the local dialect and expressions in the language.\n\n# 3.2 Sample data\n\nIn this study, financial analysts were used as the target respondents as corporate sustainability information has always been one of the valuable inputs for financial analysts to evaluate and to predict firm value (Lin, 2010). Lin (2010) suggested that financial analysts are experts who assess corporate policies and performance on various issues of sustainability in China and that financial analysts are considered to be the prime CSD users who influence other investors extensively. A good corporate sustainability reputation captured by financial analysts could improve companies’ brand value and reputation, which in turn could enhance the appeal of firm’s products to consumers (Brown and Dacin, 1997) and lead to increased sales (Dhaliwal, et al., 2012).\n\nOur sample responses were obtained in 2015, a time when President Xi initiated his leadership in China by imposing a higher degree of national sustainable development through the National Congress and the National Plan (Zhang et al., 2018). Our target respondents were the financial analysts who worked at securities organisations that were registered on the China Securities Regulatory Commission (www.csrc.gov.cn). To approach the financial analysts as our study’s respondents, we sent an email to 200 financial managers who worked at these registered security companies. Their contact information was obtained online. Each manager was also asked to distribute our Web-based survey URL to their financial analysts. We received 129 usable responses. Table I shows the demographic information of the respondents of the survey.\n\n# 3.3 Data analysis\n\nIn this study, we build on and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WANG<|>PERSON<|>Wang is a researcher who, along with Juslin, studied the differences in corporate sustainability perceptions between Western and Chinese contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSLIN<|>PERSON<|>Juslin is a researcher who collaborated with Wang on the study of corporate sustainability concepts in different cultural contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides guidelines for sustainability reporting, which may not fully align with Chinese corporate culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country where corporate sustainability concepts may be interpreted differently due to cultural factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFUCIANISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Confucianism is a philosophical system that emphasizes virtue and morality, relevant to understanding corporate sustainability in China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAOISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Taoism is a philosophical system that also contributes to the understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLINGS AND HALSTEAD<|>PERSON<|>Billings and Halstead are researchers who suggested using closed-ended questions to gather information about beliefs and perceptions in the business world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOW AND CHEN<|>PERSON<|>Chow and Chen are researchers who validated the GRI scale and studied corporate sustainability constructs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN AND DEEGAN<|>PERSON<|>Brown and Deegan are researchers who discussed the concept of materiality in sustainability reporting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS<|>PERSON<|>Financial analysts are professionals who evaluate corporate policies and performance regarding sustainability in China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESIDENT XI<|>PERSON<|>President Xi is the leader of China who initiated a higher degree of national sustainable development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL CONGRESS<|>EVENT<|>The National Congress is a political event in China where national policies, including sustainable development, are discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL PLAN<|>EVENT<|>The National Plan refers to the strategic initiatives set forth by the Chinese government to promote sustainable development.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG<|>JUSLIN<|>Wang and Juslin collaborated on a study regarding corporate sustainability perceptions in different cultural contexts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRI<|>CHINA<|>The GRI guidelines may not align with the corporate sustainability perceptions in China due to cultural differences<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFUCIANISM<|>GRI<|>Confucianism offers insights that may help interpret corporate sustainability within the framework of GRI guidelines in China<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAOISM<|>GRI<|>Taoism provides additional cultural context that may influence the interpretation of corporate sustainability in relation to GRI guidelines<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILLINGS AND HALSTEAD<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS<|>Billings and Halstead's methodology for gathering information is relevant to understanding the views of financial analysts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOW AND CHEN<|>GRI<|>Chow and Chen validated the GRI scale, which is essential for understanding corporate sustainability in the context of the study<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROWN AND DEEGAN<|>GRI<|>Brown and Deegan's work on materiality is relevant to the interpretation of sustainability reports based on GRI guidelines<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL ANALYSTS<|>PRESIDENT XI<|>Financial analysts assess corporate sustainability in the context of policies initiated by President Xi<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL CONGRESS<|>PRESIDENT XI<|>President Xi's leadership is highlighted during the National Congress, which discusses sustainable development<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL PLAN<|>PRESIDENT XI<|>The National Plan reflects the initiatives set by President Xi to promote sustainability in China<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
