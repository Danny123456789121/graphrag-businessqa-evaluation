We use White heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The coefficients of interest are b, C and K which capture the characteristics related to hypotheses 4 through 11. Definition and sources of the variables are presented in the next section.\n\nAlternative specifications (with or without the sectoral index or with the CAPM) lead to very similar results. The most serious concern is about confounding events. While there is an extensive literature on the event study methodology, the contamination of the estimation period (Aktas et al. 2007) or the event period (Nelson et al. 2008) has attracted little attention. The standard approach consists in using a case-by-case analysis to neutralize all the confounding events, but this approach is impractical for large samples. In our case, we know precisely the dates of the possible confounding events (not all of them, but the ones related to ESG news). Then, we provide a robustness check in order to tackle the problem of confounding events. We consider another estimation window (-130, -11) where confounding events included in the Covalence EthicalQuote database are neutralized. In other words, for each firm, the days surrounding ESG news (-1, 0, +1) are dropped from the estimation window. The results are qualitatively the same (see in “Appendix” section). But the contamination by non-ESG events of the estimation period or the event period remains a possible limitation of this study.\n\nFootnote 8 continued\n\n# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction\n\nData on ESG News are valuable. However, unlike Elayan et al. (2014), we do not consider aggregated data, but we examine the impact of every piece of ESG news.\n\nThe potential number of ESG news to examine is huge: dozens are published almost every day for each firm, either by the media, NGOs, consultants or the firms themselves. Therefore, in order to assess the financial impact of these information we need a very large database. Furthermore, each piece of news should be sufficiently comprehensive and precise to analyze what drives the market reaction.\n\nMost of the time, to conduct an event study, academics compose their database by collecting events from newspapers archives. In recent years, online search engines have facilitated this collect. Still, there is a huge amount of work to process the events, which usually limits the size of the database. Thus, until now, most event studies consider, at best, hundreds of events.\n\nIn this study, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Created in 2001 in Geneva (Switzerland), Covalence EthicalQuote has developed a systematic collect of positive and negative ESG information concerning the world’s largest companies. The range of ESG news is very broad. Positive news includes, for instance, announcement of a social sponsoring program, the launch of new eco-innovative product, a green award, etc. Negative news goes from toxic release disclosure to rumors of downsizing, through the disclosure of bad labor practices in subcontractor factories, etc.\n\nAccording to Covalence EthicalQuote, each day 20 analysts perform a total of 80 h of reading, screening 2000 news items (in English, Spanish, German and French). As of 2010, their database includes more than 190,000 information items from more than 10,000 sources, covering a universe of more than 500 companies. Covalence EthicalQuote uses its database to feed its ethical reputation scoring system. For each firm, the score is computed by aggregating positive and negative ethical news. Then, the scores, the rankings and some specific reports are sold to various agents like banks (Barclays, BNP Paribas, HSBC, etc), companies (Coca-Cola, HP, Nokia, etc.) and NGOs (Gain, MSF, WWF, etc.). The main advantage of this database is its comprehensiveness. Moreover, contrary to sustainability ratings, the information is firsthand.\n\nRecently, Elayan et al. (2014) have shown that the Covalence EthicalQuote data convey some useful information to investors. Indeed, they find a causal relationship between stock market reaction and Covalence quarterly press releases, which indicate changes in the ethical score of the firms. Their results reinforce our idea that these data.\n\n9 See ‘‘Appendix’’ section for some examples of ESG news collected by Covalence EthicalQuote.\n\n# The Sample\n\nCovalence provides us a sample of 126,365 ESG news items from January 2002 to December 2010. These news involve 100 listed firms which belong to the Dow Jones Sector Titans indexes (the complete list is provided in ‘‘Appendix’’ section). Some news items are related to the same event, occurred on nonbusiness days, or are poorly specified (either the nature, the event or the source of the news is missing). Consequently, these news are dropped: this leaves 65,881 events (52% of the sample). Moreover, several news may occur for the same firm on the same day, making impossible any interpretation of the market reaction. These news are dropped also, leaving a total of 33,067 ESG news (26% of the initial sample), positive or negative. This represents, on average, three ESG news per firm every month. The total number of news per firms varies approximately from 150 to 600, with a standard deviation of 110. The complete distribution is presented in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.\n\nFor each news, we know the name of the firm, the announcement date and the source. Covalence classifies ESG news into a large number of different sources that we aggregate into three categories.
