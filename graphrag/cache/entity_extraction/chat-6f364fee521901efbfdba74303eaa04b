This table shows the results from Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis for the CEP–CFP relation. Data are split according to the number of lagged years j between the two constructs. n is the number of studies, and k is the number of effect sizes. Besides, the random‐effects mean effect sizes and their standard errors are shown. Because mean correlation coefficients are accepted as remarkable in meta‐analysis when they exceed 0.10 (Cohen, 1992), mean correlation coefficients are highlighted in a bold font when they are equal to or larger than 0.10. CEP: corporate environmental performance; CFP: corporate financial performance.\n\naDue to the small number of observed effect estimates, the calculations cannot be performed completely for this subgroup.\n\n*Significant at 10% level; **Significant at 5% level; ***Significant at 1% level.\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\non the number of lagged years between the two constructs as reported in primary studies. Following the common practice introduced by Cohen (1992), we assess mean effect sizes as economically significant, if they are greater than 0.10. The results are displayed in Table 1.\n\nStarting with the full sample, the results show a mean effect size of 0.072, which is statistically significant at any common level. The same holds for the subsample of effect sizes measuring CEP and CFP concurrently with a mean effect size of 0.077. However, according to Cohen (1992), these effects are not economically significant.\n\nContinuing with the causality from CEP to CFP, the full subsample has a mean effect size of 0.056, which is statistically significant. Hence, on average, the effect seems to be slightly lower compared with the full sample. If CEP and CFP are lagged by 1 year, the effect even decreases to just 0.030, statistically significant at 5%. Because the two previous values do not exceed the threshold of 0.10, we do not share the opinion of Ameer and Othman (2012), Hart and Ahuja (1996), Horváthová (2010), Makni et al. (2009), Nakao et al. (2007), and Rassier and Earnhart (2011) that CEP really affects CFP in the following year. However, the effect increases when the time lag is extended to 2 years as proposed by Hart and Ahuja (1996) and Horváthová (2010). In this case, the mean effect size is 0.110, which is statistically significant, and the mean effect size also lies above the threshold by Cohen (1992). Hence, this effect is assessed as economically significant, which allows the conclusion that increasing CEP leads to financial benefits after 2 years. As an extension of existing literature contrasting the different causalities, we continue with the effects for 3‐year and 5‐year lags. As found for the 2‐year lag, the statistically and economically significant effect holds for the time lag of 3 years. Here, the mean effect size even increases to a statistically significant value of 0.158. For a time lag of 5 years, the mean effect size again drops to 0.117, which is still statistically and economically significant.\n\nFor the causality from CFP to CEP, the mean effect size for the full subsample is 0.100, which is statistically and also economically significant. For a more comprehensive analysis, the mean effect sizes are again calculated for the different number of lagged years. At a time lag of 1 year, the mean effect size measures 0.104, which is statistically and economically significant. This result confirms the conclusions by Heras‐Saizarbitoria et al. (2011) and Nakao et al. (2007). For a time lag of 2 years, the mean effect size even gets negative with an insignificant value of −0.058. This means that increasing CEP, which stems from the availability of additional financial resources of a firm, only remains for 1 year. After 2 years, no effect is observable anymore. Furthermore, the effect remains insignificant for a time lag of 3 years with a mean effect size of 0.055.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that increasing CEP as a consequence of additional financial resources only has a short‐term effect, which lasts 1 year. This finding is in line with the slack resources hypothesis (Kraft & Hage, 1990). Accordingly, financial slack is especially invested in eco‐friendly one‐off actions. Hence, following our results, it would\n\n# TABLE 2\n\n# Results of Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis using z‐transformed effect sizes\n\n|Subsample|n|k|Random‐effects mean effect size|Standard error|Q statistic (df)|I2 (%)|τ|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Full sample|142|893|0.073***|0.006|4852.16*** (892)|85.52|0.146|\n|CEPt ↔ CFPt|106|569|0.078***|0.007|2521.21*** (568)|81.54|0.138|\n|CEPt → CFPt+j|46|260|0.055***|0.011|1453\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
