First, we differentiate between SIM and general management (GM) journals, similarly to Orlitzky (2011). Second, we classify the journals of our 25 meta-analyses according to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) classification standard [Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) subject categories]. Third, we take into consideration the JCR journal impact factor of the publishing journals for the meta-analyses in our sample. We expect that effect sizes will tend to be smaller in more rigorous journals (e.g. Aguinis, Beaty, Boik, & Pierce, 2005). We, thus, hypothesize:\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

However, the results were not significant. Based on nearly 200 meta-studies in management research, Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, Pierce, and Dalton (2011) find that methodological choices have very little impact on the overall effect sizes. Lipsey and Wilson (1993) reveal for 302 studies in psychology that effect sizes in meta-studies are not inflated by the inclusion of methodological weak studies. To create generalizable conclusions for the CSP-CFP debate, we build on Aguinis et al. (2011) and apply a methodological strength assessment. We hypothesize:\n\nH4d: The CSP-CFP relation is independent of methodological choices.\n\n# Methods and Data\n\nThe first comprehensive summary of meta-analyses was published at the beginning of the 1990s, aggregating the work of 302 meta-analyses (Lipsey & Wilson, 1993). Ever since then, various examples of how to aggregate existing research summaries have emerged (Ahn, Ames, & Myers, 2012; Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou, & Kern, 2012; Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Hattie, 2009; Peterson, 2001; D. Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003; Tamim et al., 2011; Wilson & Lipsey, 2001). The main challenges of second-order meta-analyses are the precise calculation of the second-order average effect and estimation of its sampling error. Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein (2009) already address these challenges, but only recently have sufficient statistical methods been provided.\n\nThis study uses Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method for second-order meta-analysis. A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of independent but methodologically comparable first-order meta-analyses. It enables better generalization across contexts with a tremendously larger sample size and enhanced meta-analytic moderating factor analyses. Conclusions can be derived not just from a fraction of available primary studies, but presumably with a sample close to a complete set of studies. The Schmidt and Oh (2013) second-order meta-analysis is an advancement of the psychometric first-order predecessor – the Hunter-Schmidt (2004), approach, which is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al., 2011).\n\nSchmidt and Oh’s (2013) method has two important advantages compared to other second-level meta-analytic approaches. First, their method determines how much variance across a set of comparable first-order meta-analyses is due to second-order sampling error. This can considerably reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows estimation of the true (non-artifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes. Second, the analysis enables the computation of reliability estimates for the first-order meta-analyses and, thus, allows us to produce a more accurate estimation of the true mean effect size in each first-order meta-analysis.\n\nSchmidt and Oh (2013) present three approaches for second-order meta-analysis: bare-bones second-order meta-analysis; psychometric second-order meta-analysis with artifact distribution of first-order meta-analysis estimates; and psychometric second-order meta-analysis with individual corrected first-order meta-analysis estimates. Because of the high number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample using artifact distribution correction without correcting primary studies individually, we opted for the first two approaches to calculate our results. Both approaches vary in terms of the input data (uncorrected or attenuated correlations vis-à-vis corrected or disattenuated correlations), the weighting scheme of the first-order meta-analyses, and the calculation of the second-order mean effect size.1\n\n1See Table 1 in Schmidt and Oh (2013, p. 210) for a technical summary of the three approaches.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.
