It has also led to increasing interest among academic researchers. Zhang (2018), for example, emphasizes the importance of carbon finance within the general framework of green finance.\n\nThis paper starts from summarizing recent literature, aiming to first draw a big picture of relevant academic research. By learning from the current status, we hope to form a proper understanding of the conceptual issues, and more importantly, to identify development trends and provide useful guidance on future research directions in this important and developing subject.\n\n# 2. Methodology and basic setups\n\nThe method used in this paper is a bibliometric analysis approach. It was first used by Pritchard (1969) and has gained wide popularity to aid quantitative analysis in understanding the literature. We use CiteSpace, a software developed by Chen (2006), to show visualizing patterns of the previous studies on green finance. Given the fact that a clear conceptual definition of green finance is lacking, we\n\n1 We thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the issue of which term is a better choice “green finance” and “climate finance”. Green finance (as in IFC, 2017) will be used to emphasize global concerns on environmental issues but we do want to clarify that this term is broadly defined and thus indicating no differences to climate finance.\n\nPage 5 of 20\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nconcentrate on three aforementioned keywords search, namely, green finance, climate finance and carbon finance. We also include a number of keywords with small variations to increase the coverage of relevant literature, which are green financing, climate financing, carbon financing, green investment, and green bond.\n\nFor the retaining the general information and ease of search, we impose several restrictions on identifying relevant researches. First, all candidate papers should be in the Web of Science core collection. Second, papers should be Articles indexed in one of the following indices: Science citation index-expanded (SCIE), Social science citation index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities citation index (A&HCI), and Emerging source citation index (ESCI). Effective samples cover the range from 2001 to 2018. Third, we manually go through all titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant articles.\n\nIn total, 381 papers have been included in our sample. The number of papers published in each year is plotted in figure 1. A clear upward trend of publications can be spotted during the sample period. Noticeably, as opposed to the slow and steady growth trend before 2015, the number of relevant publications has increased sharply since 2015, which implies substantially increased interests from academics on green finance since the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\n(Insert Figure 1 here)\n\n# 3. Key results\n\nOur bibliometric analysis will focus on four main areas and aim to answer the following questions:\n\n- Which journals are these paper published?\n- Where are the authors from (countries of origin)?\n- What are the key interests (keywords analysis) of these studies?\n- How are these paper cited in the literature?\n\nPage 6 of 20\n\n# 3.1 Journal distribution\n\nTable 1 reports a list of journals according to their numbers of publications (of more than four relevant papers per journal) in our sample. Clearly, although finance is defined as a key element of green finance, the main journals publishing related works turn out to be those who concentrate on environmental and climate change. Not even one finance journal made to the list. In fact, by examining the list of papers published in finance journals, we did find some relevant ones, namely, one from Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis (Heinkel et al., 2001), two from International Review of Financial Analysis (Bredin et al., 2014; Turner, 2012), two from Emerging Market Finance and Trade (He and Liu, 2018; Celik and Binatli, 2018), and one from Finance Research Letters (Febi et al., 2018). Although the first paper in this collection is from a top finance journal, evidence here confirms what Diaz-Rainey et al. (2017) conclude, that the main stream finance journals are generally silent on the climate change issue.\n\nThree key economics journals appearing in this list are Ecological Economics, Energy Economics and Environmental & Resource Economics, which are all field journals of environmental and resource economics. It is not hard to notice that green finance is yet to become the interest of mainstream economics or finance journals, despite its widely acknowledged importance and an urgent need of full-fledged policy and regulatory tools. Much remains to be done to bring this fast developing topic into the spotlight of mainstream economic and finance research, and to fill the wide gap existing in extant literature.\n\n(Insert Table 1 here)\n\nTwo reasons exist to support our claims here. First, the amount of investment in\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nGreen/climate projects have increased substantially and maintained a strong growth momentum in the recent years. For example, global green bond issuance had a historical record of 155.5 billion US dollars in 20172, creating high demand for academic research in this area; Second, more people are interested in this area with increasing research outputs by a broader categories of academic researchers. Although it is a bit too early to see more publications now, a number of events associated with main stream finance journals in the last couple of years will surely link to relevant outputs (e.g. 2018 RFS Climate Finance Initiative in London3\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNFCCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty aimed at addressing climate change through local, national, and transnational financing mechanisms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>EVENT<|>Green finance refers to financial investments flowing into sustainable development projects and initiatives that encourage the development of a sustainable economy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON FINANCE<|>EVENT<|>Carbon finance is a subset of green finance that focuses on the financial mechanisms and investments aimed at reducing carbon emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change that aims to limit global warming and has significantly increased interest in green finance since its adoption in 2015.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITESPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CiteSpace is a software tool used for visualizing patterns and trends in scientific literature, particularly in the field of bibliometric analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pritchard<|>PERSON<|>Pritchard is credited with the development of bibliometric analysis, a method used to quantitatively analyze academic literature.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Zhang is an academic researcher who emphasizes the importance of carbon finance within the broader framework of green finance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNFCCC<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>UNFCCC supports the development of green finance initiatives to address climate change<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>CARBON FINANCE<|>Carbon finance is a specific aspect of green finance focused on reducing carbon emissions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>The Paris Agreement has led to increased interest and investment in green finance initiatives<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITESPACE<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>CiteSpace is used to analyze and visualize research trends in green finance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Pritchard<|>CITESPACE<|>Pritchard developed the bibliometric analysis method that is utilized by CiteSpace<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHANG<|>GREEN FINANCE<|>Zhang's research highlights the significance of carbon finance within green finance<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
