Thus, negative CEP-related events appear to constitute strong and (adversely) value-relevant signals for the shareholders. Contrarily, positive CEP-related events such as announcements of green supply chain initiatives (Bose and Pal 2012) or engagement in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program (Keele and DeHart 2011) strictly speaking may just represent a firm’s efforts not necessarily implying actual superior CEP. Accordingly, positive CEP-related events might not in all cases entail information that is sufficient to alter the shareholder’s evaluation of firm value. In addition, the asymmetric stock market impacts of positive and negative CEP-related events might be explained by information asymmetries prior to the events. Superior CEP might be already factored in by the markets, as firms with superior CEP are likely to publicize pertinent information, while poor performing firms would tend to withhold such information so that the “surprise” effect is much stronger for negative events (Consolandi et al. 2009; Doh et al. 2010). Future research may expand on the asymmetry issue and explore the reasons for the asymmetric market reactions to CEP-related events in more detail.\n\nWith regard to the examination of potential moderation effects, this work only found a significant moderation effect for the length of the event windows. For negative events the population r for longer windows was significantly smaller than that for the (-1, 1) window. For positive CEP-related events only the population r for the (-1, 1) window was significant while a significant population r for longer event windows was not found. From a theoretical point of view, this finding further highlights the more material effect of negative CEP-related events compared to positive events. Negative CEP-related events appear to entail stock market reactions that are stronger and more persistent over time compared with the reactions to positive events. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, this finding provides support for the recommendations of McWilliams and Siegel (1997) to use event windows that are as short as possible. Contrary to the argument of Barnett and King (2008) proposing that the market may need some time to capture the full impact of certain events, the current findings suggest that the market is able to factor in the information revealed by CEP-related events rapidly.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that the length of the event window was the only statistically significant moderation effect that was detected in the current work. While the width of the confidence intervals and the significance of the Q statistics for most of the subgroups indicated that the variation of the findings of the event studies included in the analysis was above that expected by chance, the subgroups failed to capture these effects. That means, while subgroup analyses indicated the presence of moderation effects, the particular effects could not be specified.\n\nThe failure of the present meta-analysis to reveal moderation effects that would adequately explain the observed heterogeneity clearly suggests a need for further research to identify moderation effects, attributed to both methodology and theory that may explain the variation in the study findings. For example, scholars may explore whether country-specific differences may entail moderation effects regarding the stock market reactions to CEP-related events. The current meta-analysis showed that regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions seem to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples. Since several factors that are likely to influence stock market reactions to CEP-related events are dependent on country-specific institutional contexts (e.g., Bansal and Roth 2000; Baughn et al. 2007; Etzion 2007), future research exploring the national context-specific mechanisms that may account for the differences in more detail might yield important insights.\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\nAnother interesting avenue for future research may refer to the frequently expressed notion that the market’s awareness regarding environmental issues has increased over time (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Flammer 2013). The findings of the current study point in this direction as the population r calculated across studies examining stock market reactions to positive events that occurred before the year 2000 was not significant, contrary to market reactions to positive events occurring after the year 2000. Related to this, and probably even more interesting, is the question of why the increase in market reactions to CEP-related events seems to apply only to positive events but not to negative ones. Contrary to the finding regarding positive events, the rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000. This suggests that the stock market reactions to negative events may have not been subject to changes over time, while the reaction to positive events constitute a more recent phenomenon. One potential explanation may be that the negative financial effects of poor CEP arising from reputational damages or impeding fines and remediation costs have been well established for some time, while the beneficial effects of superior CEP resulting from competitive resources or improved stakeholder relationships have only recently been taken into consideration due to an increased attention on sustainability issues.\n\nFinally, future research could also focus on the differences with regard to the specific events examined in the event studies. In view of the fact that CEP must be considered a multidimensional construct (Trumpp et al. 2015) it is obvious that also CEP-related events address quite different aspects of CEP. Therefore, one potential reason for the variation of the study results may refer to the variety of different events such as environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996), product- and process-driven environmental initiatives (Gilley et al. 2000), inclusion and exclusion from the DJSI (Consolandi et al. 2009), or membership in voluntary environmental initiatives (Keele and DeHart 2011).
