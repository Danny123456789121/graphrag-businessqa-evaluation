Since authors have to go through a rigorous reviewing process to publish their papers in good journals, overly affirmative or overly negative results will be toned down. Thus, if the reviewing process is more rigorous, the AES will become smaller. To examine this idea, we introduce a new variable, Quality, which captures the quality of papers. It is equal to one for journals above median ranking in the same discipline classified by Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, and zero for journals below median ranking. As can be seen in Tables 6 and 7, the coefficients of the Quality variable are negative, indicating that papers published in better quality journals tend to have smaller AESs.\n\n# 5.2.3. Author type.\n\nAcademic researchers and industry professionals are different in many respects, including incentives for research (Vaihekoski, 2004). In academic circles, the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted, but industry professionals are more concerned with finding superior abnormal return opportunities than providing evidence that supports the efficient market hypothesis. This difference will have a dampening effect on AESs for academic researchers. Consistent with this argument, Tables 6 and 7 show that academic researchers tend to find significantly smaller AESs than industry professionals, supporting Hypothesis 4-1. When combined with the statistical significance dummy in model (7) of Table 7, the cross-multiplication term of the two variables shows a significantly negative sign. It implies that among significant results, researchers in academia tend to find lower AESs than industry professionals, which is again consistent with Hypothesis 4-1.\n\nIt is possible that researchers in different disciplines may place a different priority on social and economic values. Researchers in the finance area may put a higher priority on profit maximization than social aspects, producing results showing a.\n\n# Table 9   Publication bias\n\nThis table shows the result of the publication bias test using Stata 14.0. The dependent variable is a standard normal deviate of intervention effect, and the independent variable is a measure of precision, the reciprocal of standard error. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\n\n|Std_Eff|Coef.|Std err.|t|p > t|[95% conf. interval]| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Slope|0.085***|0.020|4.21|0.000|0.125|0.045|\n|Bias|0.574|0.379|1.51|0.132|0.173|1.320|\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# 5.2.4. Control group.\n\nIn general, SRI funds characteristics are not the same as those of the market index, which includes not only SRI funds stocks but also stocks of all other conventional funds. In addition, since SRI cannot have unconstrained access to whole investment opportunities, SRI portfolios are different from well-diversified market portfolios. Owing to this difference, Hypothesis 5-1 predicts that papers comparing SRI portfolios with the market index will produce larger AESs than papers comparing SRI and conventional portfolios composed by author(s) according to their research objectives. Consistent with this hypothesis, the dummy variable for market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly positive sign in Tables 6 and 7. This argument is further reinforced by the negative sign of the SRI_CI variable, which is consistent with Hypothesis 5-2. Since the difference is lower when comparing two indexes than when comparing SRI portfolios with the index, the former tends to have smaller AESs.\n\nOn the other hand, Table 8 shows meta-regression results on the influence of sampling moderators upon ESs themselves. Consistent with Hypothesis 5-3, the dummy variable for using the market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly negative sign. It implies that the relative loss of diversification is larger when SRI portfolios are compared with the market index rather than other control portfolios. The negative sign is also consistent with Luther and Matatko (1994) who obtain mostly negative excess returns of SRI portfolios when they use the market index as benchmark.\n\n# 5.2.5. Investment universe.\n\nIn Table 8, the dummy variable for the domestic market shows a positively significant coefficient, which is consistent with Hypothesis 6. Since the cultural aspect is an important determinant of ESs, the effect of SRI will be stronger when the investment universe is domestic rather than international. Markets with a homogeneous cultural background will be affected more strongly by SRI, since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006).\n\n# 5.2.6. Screening procedure.\n\nTable 8 shows that SRI funds using a positive screening procedure outperform funds with a negative screening, as postulated by Hypothesis 7. This result is consistent with Humphrey and Lee (2011) who find that a positive screening significantly reduces funds’ risk, but a negative screening increases risk since it impairs the ability of funds to form diversified portfolios. More directly, Goldreyer and Diltz (1999) and Statman and Glushkov (2009) show that a positive screening has a\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nPositive impact on portfolio performance, but a negative screening has a negative impact.\n\n# 5.2.7.
