IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions.\n\nat the end of the year, and then dividing this value by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year. We further decompose the institutional ownership with respect to subgroups of owners. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership by insurance companies; IO_INVESTCOS is the ownership by investment companies (e.g., mutual funds); IO_ADVISERS is the ownership by independent investment advisers; IO_PENSIONS is the ownership by pension funds and IO_HFS is the ownership by hedge funds. Even though the total institutional ownership captures the intensive margin only, the range of disaggregated ownership variables varies from 0% to 100% (as long as the total institutional ownership in the data has a positive value).\n\nThe control variables in the ownership regressions include PRINVi,t, which is the inverse of firm i’s share price at the end of year t; VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of monthly stock returns for firm i over the one-year period; VOLUMEi,t is the average daily trading volume (in $million) of stock i over the calendar year t. NASDAQi,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is listed on NASDAQ in year t, and zero otherwise; SP500i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is part of the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zero otherwise. We report the summary statistics for these variables in Panel D of Table 1.\n\nThe average IO is 0.77, and the cross-sectional standard deviation of IO is 0.22. In other words, in a typical year, a typical firm has about 77% of its shares held by institutional investors, and the standard deviation of institutional ownership in a typical cross-section is 22%. Among the different institutional owners, independent advisers are the biggest holders, with an average stock’s ownership equal to 43.9%, followed by investment companies with an average 18.2% ownership. Banks and insurance companies, in turn, are the smallest institutional owners. The average daily stock return volatility in our sample is 10% or annualized 158.7%. The average daily stock volume is $440,000. Finally, about 30% of stock-month observations are companies listed on NASDAQ, and 37% observations are firms from the S&P 500 Index.\n\n# 3. Results\n\nWe begin our analysis by investigating the determinants of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions. We then turn to the evaluation of the carbon return premium in the cross-section of stocks. We next explore the time-series properties of the cross-sectional carbon premium with respect to well-known risk factors. Finally, we consider the divestment hypothesis by looking at institutional ownership patterns.\n\n# 3.1. Determinants of carbon emissions\n\nSince emissions are not reported by all companies, one basic issue to explore first is how companies that do report their emissions compare with non-reporting companies. To assess the quantitative differences on the extensive margin, we compare various firm-level characteristics for the reporting and non-reporting firms. We describe basic summary statistics of the two categories of firms in Table A.1 of the Appendix. As one might expect, we find that larger firms are more likely to report their emissions. Also, firms with lower book-to-market ratios and higher book leverage are more likely to report emissions. At the same time, the two groups of firms do not differ significantly in terms of their stock returns or investment levels.\n\nNext, we assess the differences in emission levels, year-by-year changes, and emission intensities across firms using a regression framework. Our dependent variables are levels, changes, and intensities of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3. Since there is little theory that can guide us on what determines the level of carbon emissions, especially with regard to their different sources, we include a host of firm-level variables, comprising LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, SALESGR, and EPSGR. To reflect the possibility that firm-level emissions could concentrate across firms and over time, we cluster standard errors at the firm and year levels. Standard errors in all panel regressions become significantly smaller in alternative specifications that cluster at the firm, industry, time, or industry and time levels. We present the results in Table 7.\n\nNot surprisingly, all three categories of emission levels, and changes in emissions, are significantly positively related to LOGSIZE. However, scope 1 and scope 3 emission intensities are weakly negatively related to LOGSIZE. The level of emissions is also significantly associated with high book-to-market ratios, high tangible capital (PPE), highly levered firms, and firms with high\n\n# 3.2. Evidence on cross-sectional returns\n\nFor all three categories of emissions, we relate in turn the level of companies’ emissions, the year-to-year growth in emissions, and the companies’ emission intensity to their corresponding stock returns in the cross-section. We first estimate the following cross-sectional regression model using pooled OLS:\n\n(1) where measures the stock return of company i in month t and Emissions is a generic term alternately standing for SCOPE 1, SCOPE 2, and SCOPE 3 emissions. The vector of controls includes a host of firm-specific variables known to predict returns, such as LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, MOM, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, BETA, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR. We also include year/month fixed effects.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
