It is believed that, after the COVID-19 pandemic, business transitions will increase in order to achieve a more sustainable corporate sustainability. This transition will allow organizations to develop flexible manufacturing systems, prioritizing environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Regarding decision support systems for resilient production, there are various options available, such as those proposed by Tan et al. [52] and the prediction model for supply chains of Ivanov et al. [53]. Thus, companies and supply chains need to be resilient to tackle tough times, such as what occurs during the current pandemic.\n\nAs expected, the economic crisis that followed the COVID-19 epidemic affected several businesses, from manufacturers to service providers due to the social distancing and lockdowns [54]. Thus, the businesses in which customers interact with each other were immediately stopped [55, 56]. To avoid bankruptcy, these businesses moved to palliative solutions aiming for their survival, mainly migrating the businesses to digital platforms [57].\n\nThe epidemic effects on delivery delays are affecting supply chains, causing bullwhip effects, and unbalancing organizations’ performances in almost all industries. Thus, companies are focusing on essential items for manufacturing and maintaining supply activities regarding the unexpected disruptions. At the same time, these organizations are planning how to restart the businesses close to the ‘new normal’, as society is returning to (a semi) normality.\n\nThe main justification for considering the COVID-19 pandemic effects in corporate sustainability, within this study, is that its consequences will be felt for decades [58]. Thus, as a long-lasting event, it is assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect organizations regarding their sustainability actions in the future.\n\nWe considered various decision attributes and indicators for the development of a multidimensional sustainability framework. These attributes can assist in the construction of an effective corporate sustainability model while also providing insights into sustainable business practices. This study develops a decision criterion for sustainable development based on the literature and then checked the criteria validity provided by key expert’s contributions. The main sustainability criteria in our development of a sustainability framework include Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economics, Social, Environmental, Natural Environmental and Climate Change, Energy Saving and Consumption, and what we believe to be used for the first time, the COVID-19 pandemic criteria. As per the best of the authors’ knowledge, pandemic impacts have not been used before in sustainability models to date, the consideration of COVID-19 pandemic effects will help to fulfill a gap in the literature.\n\nEach of these sustainability criteria has a total of forty-five sub-criteria. These criteria were identified after reviewing and summarizing the literature. The results of which criteria and sub-criteria are shown in Table 2. Next, we attempt to extend the corporate sustainability model based on the ‘Plan, Do, Check, and Act’ (PDCA) approach, as presented in Figure 2.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747\n\n# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n# PLAN\n\n# Stakeholder requirements\n\n- Accountability\n- Public Private partnership\n- Product\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
