Thus, the HR function can use generative AI to improve its own processes and outcomes and contribute to organizational effectiveness through more efficient processing and decision-making in a range of HR practices. These potentially include swift provision of semi-standardised information in areas such as job descriptions, job profiles, employment forms and procedures. The interactive nature of bots (short for robots) offers considerable potential for training and development and can undertake activities such as addressing employee queries currently provided by HR call centres. For some time there has been advocacy of evidence based HRM. A potentially helpful outcome of generative AI is the availability of evidence-based information on which to base HR decisions and improve HR outcomes. This can address both external evidence, drawing on systematic reviews of the impact of policy and other interventions to improve people management, and internal HR analytic data to provide analysis of labour turnover, absence and much HR data. Reducing the time to assemble HR information could release time for core HR activities including supporting line management, addressing employee problems and contributing to strategic thinking about the kind of outcomes to prioritise for people management. This is the promise; the reality may be more challenging with questions about the trustworthiness of AI-generated data, confidence among employees in interacting with bots, and imbalance in the socio-technical system.\n\nThe potential outcomes of generative AI for employee well-being are likely to attract considerable attention. In the post-Covid era, there is already considerable concern about the health of the workforce and organizations ranging from the OECD to the UK Chartered Institute of Personnel and development have called for improvements in the quality of work (see Guest et al., 2022). This focus should provide a core part of an evaluation of outcomes. More specifically, evaluation might focus on changes in the configuration of roles and on changes in autonomy and decision-making. Positive outcomes could include opportunities for many in knowledge, technical and professional jobs to reduce the routine activities releasing time for the skills where human input will be superior including judgement, innovation, problem-solving and interpersonal interaction. There will also be a continuing and expanding need for many skill-based jobs. However, there is a risk that reconfiguring work also leads to the loss of several routine administrative jobs presenting challenges for the HR function as it manages the change in the composition of the workforce. There is also the risk, outlined above, that management encourages outcomes that result in technological determinism allied to a lack of effective monitoring of information and decisions produced by generative AI.\n\nThe outcomes in terms of community well-being point to a need to prioritise the development of relevant skills to address the risk of a growing divide between those who are more or less employable. A challenge for the HR function will be how to contribute to re-skilling of those both in their organization's employment and a responsibility to support skill development through systems such as apprenticeships and retraining. This is especially so, given the prediction of job losses or degrades, due to AI, to the tune of 300 million, by a recent Goldman Sachs report, as reported by Forbes (Kelly, 2023). In the wider society, the way in which generative AI is applied in organizations will affect perceptions of fairness, inequality and trust in management.\n\nIn summary, generative AI creates a new research agenda for HRM scholars. A core research question in evaluating the outcomes of AI concerns the extent to which a successful balance has been achieved between the technical and the social systems to ensure that the needs of stakeholders are addressed and that it leads to a good quality of working life with spill over effects into the community and beyond. This outcome is only likely if there is a real possibility of mutual gains for the main stakeholders; indeed, it extends the agenda for research on mutual gains. It also provides the HRM community and the HR function with a distinctive advocacy role for a human-centric AI and in particular generative AI; and this provides the core focus for evaluation of its outcomes.\n\n# 3 | GENERATIVE AI – EMPLOYEE RELATIONS, WELLBEING, TALENT AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\n\n# 3.1 | ChatGPT impact on employment relations, employee wellbeing and engagement\n\nAndrew J. Knoblich17 and Steven Rogelberg17\n\n# 3.1.1 | Introduction\n\nOrganizations are increasingly adopting AI-enabled chatbots and conversational agents, like ChatGPT, to enhance stakeholder relations, engagement, and wellbeing across various industries (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017). Whereas ChatGPT's impact across contexts will vary, this technology is poised to substantially alter HRM practices and systems in most organizational settings (Edlich et al., 2018; OpenAI, 2023). In its present state, ChatGPT can be integrated into work environments as a component of a bespoke network of applications (OpenAI, 2023). Depending on its use case, ChatGPT can provide on-demand personalized support, novel responses to complex queries, and guidance on a host of topics (Hatzius et al., 2023). The purpose of this section is to discuss the impact of ChatGPT on employment relations, employee wellbeing and employee engagement as well as to outline a research agenda for further investigation.\n\n# 3.1.2 | Implications of ChatGPT\n\n# Employment Relations\n\nChatGPT has the potential to automate various commonplace tasks in the HRM context. For example, Edlich et al. (2018) highlighted the incorporation of chatbots and cognitive agents in HR service centres that responded to employee inquiries, managed benefits administration, and oversaw record-keeping.
