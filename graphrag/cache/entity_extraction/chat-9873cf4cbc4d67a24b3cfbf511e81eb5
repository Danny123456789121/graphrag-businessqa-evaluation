Amid the rapid growth and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve—from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may provide quality service—such as copy-writing—to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models—specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge. Not only the obvious expert-level data scientist roles but also low grade, “model supervisors”—people training the models, assessing the quality of responses given and handling escalations. Lastly new cybercrime risks emerging from the rise of GAI are discussed.\n\n# Keywords\n\n- disruptive technology\n- artificial intelligence (AI)\n- Large Language Models (LLM)\n- Generative AI\n- business models\n\nJEL codes: L86, C88, L21, L26, L84, M13\n\nArticle received 29 April 2023, accepted 16 June 2023.\n\n1 WithSecure (WITH.HE), 77 Weston Street, London SE1 3RS, United Kingdom, tim.orchard@withsecure.com, https://orcid.org/0009-0004-4779-7843.\n\n2 WithSecure (WITH.HE), ul.

Shortcomings and risks are also discussed—ranging from the technical, to legal and security and privacy matters. The authors believe that the discussed technology has recently reached a tipping point that will enable a rapid and broad adoption, possibly on a scale that can be called the next industrial revolution. Many indicators suggest that the maturity of AI technology is now past the tipping point of broad adoption in core value streams and critical processes.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 1 the concept of Generative AI is described along with historical background and limitations of today’s state of same. Section 2 discusses possible implications of GAI on the job market with both a creative and destructive potential. In Section 3 the GAI technology is analysed from the perspective of offering new, disruptive business models. Section 4 is dedicated to risks stemming from the use of GAI technology both by legitimate and by malicious actors. In Section 5 the legal implications of GAI are discussed.\n\n# 1. The Generative AI (GAI)\n\nThe technology collectively called artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML), is a very broad term. It covers many kinds of computer science techniques where the algorithm (a model in AI terminology) is programmed in such a form, where a given task such as grouping of similar items or finding anomalies is achieved in a different way than an explicit procedure and exact matching to a human-defined pattern (Korzynski et al., 2023). Typically it would mean that during the process called training of the algorithm, the model automatically deduces the pattern and is able to generalize despite the lack of exact human-made rules.\n\n# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy\n\nAs such these techniques are not new. They have been hypothesized as early as in the 1950s (Turing, 1950) or even 1940’s as “A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity” which was presented in 1943 by Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch. The first implementations of self-improving algorithms happened in the 1950s and 1960s. However, up until recently those algorithms were not mainstream mostly due to a lack of computing power which made them slow and less convenient than traditional, procedural algorithms.\n\nIn recent years an exponential growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology and its applications can be observed. GAI using usually very big models (GPT-4, released by OpenAI in 2023 uses 170 trillion parameters) trained on vast libraries of text, pictures and other inputs and is a technology capable of generating novel, “creative” content in response to an input (prompt). These algorithms can be interacted with using a natural language and typically are sophisticated statistical models. In most of the machine learning models knowledge is represented internally as a set of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
