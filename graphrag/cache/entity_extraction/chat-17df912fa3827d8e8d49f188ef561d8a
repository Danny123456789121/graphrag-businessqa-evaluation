There is negative correlation between generative AI exposure and percent of male, Black, and Hispanic representation.\n\n# Citation\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2023\n\n# Unit of analysis\n\nFunction; industries; occupations\n\n# Scope\n\nForty-seven countries covering 80 percent of global workforce\n\n# Approach summary\n\n- Estimate when technologies including generative AI will reach median and top quartile human performance against 18 different capabilities through expert assessments.\n- Map these assessments to DWAs and occupations to develop scenarios of technical automation potential increasing over time.\n- Model scenarios for automation adoption for DWAs, occupations and countries that include technical automation potential, solution integration timelines, economic feasibility versus wage rates, and technology diffusion rates.\n\n# Data collection\n\n- Occupation and detailed work activity data was sourced from O*NET.\n- Employment and wage data was sourced from national statistical agencies (such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\n# Key relevant findings\n\n- The capabilities of generative AI have increased the share of time spent on work activities that theoretically could be automated by adapting technologies available in 2023 from about half to two-thirds of all working time.\n- The pace of adoption is likely to accelerate, with estimates that half of today’s work activities could be automated in scenarios that range from 2030 to 2060, with a midpoint in 2045—or roughly a decade earlier than the midpoint estimate produced by our 2017 scenarios.\n- Experts’ assessment shows much of this acceleration in the potential for technical automation is due to generative AI’s increased natural language capabilities.\n- Unlike most automation in the past, the impact of generative AI will fall most heavily on occupations requiring higher levels of education and commanding higher wages.\n- Generative AI could increase labor productivity by 0.1 percent to 0.6 percent annually over\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
