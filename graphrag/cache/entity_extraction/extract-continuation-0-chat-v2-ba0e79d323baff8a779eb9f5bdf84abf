An actual count of the papers that Orlitzky et al. (2003) included in their meta-analysis revealed that 51 of the papers had effects sizes recorded, hence 51 papers have been included in our meta-analysis.\n\nWe carried out our meta-analyses using these three choices of effect size in order to see the impact on the meta analyses that results from the different effect sizes reported in each of the prior studies (i.e. the 51 studies).\n\n|Effect size|Pessimistic|Optimistic positive|Optimistic negative|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Between 2x and 2y|0|0|2x|\n|Between 2x and y|0|y|2x|\n|Between x and y|x|y|x|\n\nIt is to be noted that in some cases, a range of sample sizes is also provided in the papers listed above (Table I). For our paper the smallest sample size will be used for the relevant analysis. This choice leads to a ‘‘worst-case’’ contribution to the meta analysis. Our results could then be even stronger if the larger sample size was taken into consideration for the relevant analysis.\n\nBased on the above discussion, the following propositions are presented for testing:\n\n- P1. Year of publication of the papers will have an effect on the strength of the relationship between CSR on CFP.\n- P2. Sample size of the concerned studies will have an effect on the strength of the relationship between CSR on CFP.\n- P3. Statistical techniques used will have an effect on the strength of the relationship between CSR on CFP.\n\n# 5. Results of meta-analysis (1974-1999)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our meta-analysis has examined the relationships between CSR and the financial performance of firms focusing on the following aspects: five-year time intervals, sample size and methodology employed.\n\n# 5.1 Meta analysis by five-year time intervals\n\nWe propose that time (year) of publication of the concerned studies has an effect on the results of the studies. Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis involves 51 papers published between the period 1974-1999. In order to maintain a reasonable number of papers in each time interval, while still having a reasonably large number of time intervals, we decided to group the years of publication of the concerned papers into five-year intervals, starting in 1970. It has been assumed that the year of publication is closely related to the year(s) in which the study data was collected. Confidence intervals for the effect size by five-year time intervals can be seen in Table II. These intervals were calculated using the Hedges method described by Field (2005, pp. 301-3). In this method effect sizes are converted to standard normal variates, then their weighted average is calculated. The weights are based on the within-study and between-study variance of the studies. A confidence interval for the overall effect size is then found using the normal distribution, and a formula for the standard error of the mean effect size. Three intervals are shown for this purpose. The pessimistic interval uses the effect size closest to zero defined earlier in Table II. The optimistic positive interval used the most positive effect size defined in Table II. Finally, the optimistic negative interval uses the most negative effect size defined in Table II.\n\nThe results revealed that with the passage of five-year periods, the results tend to become more precise (confidence intervals become generally narrower). Furthermore, with the passage of time the meta-analysis estimate of effect size also tends to be more positive. In other words, it can be said that the results of the more recent studies have higher interpretive value. The conclusion that can be drawn from this finding is that the quality of studies in terms of precision and strength has improved as time progressed.\n\nThe half-decade intervals used are standard in time series analysis (e.g. Cochran and Wood, 1984). Neither two-year nor ten-year intervals provided a better indication of the change in quality as time progressed (see Table III).\n\nVOL. 8 NO. 2 2012 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j PAGE 247\n\n# Table III Meta analysis of effect size by year\n\n|Year|95 per cent CI (pessimistic)|95 per cent CI (optimistic positive)|95 per cent CI (optimistic negative)|Number of papers|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1970-1974|–a|–a|–a|1|\n|1975-1979|[20.03, 0.15]|[0.03, 0.77]|[20.19, 0.19]|14|\n|1980-1984|[20.12, 0.47]|[0.21, 0.91]|[20.51, 0.43]|7|\n|1985-1989|[0.00, 0.35]|[0.17, 0.53]|[20.07, 0.32]|11|\n|1990-1994|[20.02, 0.08]|[0.14, 0.53]|[20.34, 20.03]|10|\n|1995-1999|[0.03, 0.22]|[0.24, 0.56]|[0.00, 0.21]|12|\n|Total|51|51|51|51|\n\nNote: Only one study: n ¼ 12, r ¼ 0:22\n\nThe above results make sense because as time progresses it is to be expected that firms will improve their ability to implement CSR from a strategic viewpoint. Therefore, the likelihood of firms experiencing positive financial outcomes from CSR will increase leading to greater engagement with CSR\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky et al.
