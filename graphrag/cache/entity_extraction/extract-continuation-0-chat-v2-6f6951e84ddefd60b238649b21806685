Proponents of good management theory (Waddock & Graves, 1997) argue that prior good CSP leads subsequently to better CFP. The opposite explanation is the slack resources theory (Cyert & March, 1963; J. B. McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), where excess financial resources of a company are seen as a necessary condition in order to reinvest and, thus, counter threats or exploit opportunities (Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, & Turner, 2004). Following this view, prior superior CFP leads subsequently to improved CSP. As both theories found theoretical and empirical support, a common argument is that there exists a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP – they seem to be related reciprocally and concurrently (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Waddock & Graves, 1997). We follow this line of thought and thus expect:\n\nH1b: The causality of the CSP-CFP relation is bidirectional.\n\n# The Relation of various CSP Dimensions and CFP\n\n# Corporate Environmental Performance\n\nSince the first review studies on the CSP-CFP relation (Aldag & Bartol, 1978; Arlow & Gannon, 1982), research has considered corporate environmental performance (CEP) as part of CSP. Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) were the first to split the CSP construct and analyze CEP separately. These authors assume investors and consumers are less aware of the environmental performance of firms. In contrast, social aspects are more likely to be publicly communicated and, thus, reflected by stock- and stakeholders. Accordingly, the authors report a weaker CEP-CFP correlation compared to the overall sample. Orlitzky et al. (2003) reiterate the weak relation between CEP and CFP. Over the course of the years, individual meta-studies dedicated specifically to CEP and/or the social dimension of CSP were published. The summary effects for the CEP-CFP relation were often positive and significant (Albertini, 2013; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, & Romi, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014). However, the absolute level usually demonstrated lower correlation levels compared to studies purely focusing on social aspects (Combs, Liu, Hall, & Ketchen, 2006; Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, & Ketchen, 2011; Unger, Rauch, Frese, & Rosenbusch, 2011). In line with these findings, we expect:\n\nH2a: The relation between CSP (excluding environmental aspects) and CFP is stronger than for CEP and CFP.\n\n# CSP Reputation\n\nFour CSP dimensions attracted the greatest interest among meta-researchers in the past: CSP reputation, CSP disclosure, CSP philanthropy, and CSP audits, processes, and policies. CSP reputation (Barnett, Jermier, & Lafferty, 2006) typically yields high correlations with CFP. The reason being that corporate reputation is of particular importance.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

Friede\n\nrelevance or interest to a variety of external parties. For example, reputation is likely to influence customers’ behaviours and investors’ decisions (Orlitzky et al., 2003). This intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate, leads to sustained superior profit over time (P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002). Literature reviews and meta-analytical results point in a similar direction (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Sabate & Puente, 2003). We, thus, hypothesize that CSP reputation plays a dominant role:\n\n# H2b:\n\nWithin the CSP dimensions, reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP.\n\n# CSP Disclosure\n\nA more controversial debate exists regarding the link between CSP disclosure and CFP. Wiseman (1982) finds considerable discrepancies between CSP disclosures and actual CSP. Ullmann (1985) concludes that voluntary disclosure should not be considered as a proxy for CSP performance. R. W. Roberts (1992) discovers that stakeholder power, philanthropic activities, and previous economic performance significantly explain concurrent CSP disclosure. Orlitzky et al. (2003) ascribe a minimal positive relation between CSP disclosure practices and CFP, whereas additionally almost all of the observed effect size variance is due to statistical artifacts. Research in environmental management also nourishes a weak relation among both measures. Schultze and Trommer (2012, p. 396) summarize, based on a review of empirical research, that ‘as disclosure is mostly voluntary, many companies only provide beneficial rather than accurate, unbiased information on their current performance’. This could lead, in turn, to distorted information of market participants accompanied by increased stock volatility when investors realize that their investment decisions were based on wrong assumptions (Orlitzky, 2013). Thus, we expect a relatively weaker link of CSP disclosure and CFP:\n\n# H2c:\n\nWithin the CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP.\n\n# The Relation of CSP and various CFP Categories\n\n# Perceptional CFP\n\nPerceptual evaluations of business performance by senior executives are considered to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSP-CFP RELATION<|>EVENT<|>The CSP-CFP relation refers to the connection between Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), exploring how one influences the other.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WADDOCK & GRAVES<|>PERSON<|>Waddock & Graves are researchers who argue that prior good CSP leads to better CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYERT & MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Cyert & March are theorists associated with the slack resources theory, suggesting that excess financial resources lead to improved CSP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J.
