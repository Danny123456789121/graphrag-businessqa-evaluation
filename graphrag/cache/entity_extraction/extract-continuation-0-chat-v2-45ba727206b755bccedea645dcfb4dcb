Gardner and Sinclair (2003) explained that the role of the state was crucial in eradicating the pollution problems. In another example of government intervention to improve the environmental conditions, Xanthos and Walker (2017) described that pollution problems had compelled the governments to devise laws/policies to overcome the pollution problems.\n\nThe role of local government was also crucial in the implementation of policies (Sinclair and Fenton 1997) comparing the Canadian National Packaging Protocol and the European Parliament Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. They identified that the EU and Canada policies were weak as there was a lack of obligation at the province level in Canada and member states level in the EU. Another view of policymaking is environmental taxation, which can bring desirable change in the right direction. This approach can contribute in long terms.\n\n# Organizational barriers\n\nFor better implementation of CS policies, researchers identified multiple factors. A study of CS in the Chinese manufacturing industry (Orji 2019) identified twelve barriers, wherein eleven are organizational barriers. These barriers include inefficient, poor, and inadequate plans, poor waste management, low suppliers selection, lack of finances, inferior technology, lack of top management commitment, communication gap, lack of training, lack of awareness among stakeholders, insufficient environmental compliances, and absence of good employee welfare plans. Several other researchers also identified these organizational barriers in their studies (Klewitz et al. 2012; Nykvist and Nilsson 2009; Moore 2005; Orji 2019; Trianni et al. 2017).\n\nEngert et al. (2016) argue that companies must take the initiative to incorporate CS in their policies. Managers must create a learning environment or learning organization where employees interact with CS’s environmental and social dimensions. Nykvist and Nilsson (2009) mentioned that an organizational barrier includes lack of adequate time, expertise, resources, and availability of sufficient data for decision-making; and some structural barriers, which include the behavior of the policymaker, and the business sector is also one factor that affects the policy implementation process. Policy management has two essential factors, first is policy formulation, and the second is its implementation (Mintzberg and Waters 1985). Companies have developed sufficient skills in devising the policies; whereas the implementation of the policy still lacks (Zahn 1979), which causes the gap between the policy and its implementation.\n\n# Self-regulation/subsidiarity/reflexive laws\n\nThe subsidiarity approach in environmental issues advocates for addressing and resolving the environmental problems at the local level within the member states of the EU, preferably with the participation of local authorities and citizens (Collier 1997). CS practice is an opportunity for business organizations, through which businesses can embed themselves in society by addressing social needs. This opportunity is not stringent, and it is based on reflexive law/self-regulation (Deakin and Hobbs 2007). In reality, CS practices are still not adopted in business processes. Once, If the CS issues are understood, businesses can avert risk and meet competitiveness (Deakin and Hobbs 2007; Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).\n\n# Environ Sci Pollut Res (2021) 28:10335–10356\n\n|Approach/author|Different approaches to policymaking|Economic instrument policy approach|Integrated sustainability assessment|Consultant services approach|Evidence-based approach|Participatory approach|Systematic approach|Grassroots approach|Practice approach|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Moore (2005)|✔| | | | | | | | |\n|Bailey (1999)|✔|✔| | | | | | | |\n|Mathis (2007)|✔| | | | | | | | |\n|Abreu (2009)| | | | | | | |✔| |\n|Klewitz et al.
