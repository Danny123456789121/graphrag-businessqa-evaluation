In addition, the type of industry may also have confounding influences pertaining to the focal relationship, as the type of industry may also determine CFP (Porter, 1985), separately from CEP.\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that firms with better CEP tend to incur lower levels of financial risk (e.g., Feldman, Soyka, & Ameer, 1997; Spicer, 1978; Sun & Cui, in press). Since CEP is likely to influence reputation and investors’ perceptions of a firm’s future performance (e.g., Gilley, Worrell, Davidson, & El-Jelly, 2000; Russo & Fouts, 1997), it may provide a type of insurance value by decreasing financial risk (Peloza, 2006). In other words, high levels of CEP, implying reduced environmental risk, determine investors’ risk perception and will be rewarded by the market (Sharfman & Fernando, 2008). Furthermore, firms with a proactive stance towards environmental issues face lower litigation risks and may attenuate the likelihood of regulatory interventions which can also have risk-reducing effects (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). In sum, financial risk may mediate the relationship between CEP and CFP, which suggests that studies that fail to control for financial risk would yield upwardly biased estimates of the focal relationship (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).\n\nThe relationship between CEP and CFP is also likely to be determined by a firm’s R&D activities. First, there is relatively strong empirical evidence that R&D intensity positively influences CFP (e.g., Griliches, 1979; McWilliams & Siegel, 2000). According to McWilliams and Siegel (2000) R&D constitutes a form of investment in “technical” capital which is suggested to result in knowledge enhancement leading to product and process innovation which in turn increase long-term financial performance. While, of course, R&D intensity does not represent a perfect measure of innovation (Baysinger & Hoskisson, 1989), it has been widely used in empirical studies as a proxy for innovation (Camisón-Zornoza, Lapiedra-Alcamí, Segarra-Ciprés, & Boronat-Navarro, 2004; Hitt, Hosskisson, & Kim, 1997). Second, R&D intensity may also be associated with CEP as R&D activities may be a precursor of CEP providing firms with innovative approaches to environmental issues (Christmann, 2000). For example, the initiation and implementation of a clean technology policy or the development of “green” products require R&D efforts (Etzion, 2007; Hart, 1995; Russo & Fouts, 1997). Hence, R&D intensity may have a confounding effect on the relationship between CEP and CFP and therefore should be considered as control variable (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000; Orlitzky, 2008).\n\nAdvertising intensity constitutes another factor that is likely to be involved in the CEP–CFP relationship. Capon, Farley, and Hoenig (1990) provided evidence for a positive association between advertising intensity and financial performance. Furthermore, advertising can be viewed as a means to signal environmental activities to stakeholders, which may expand the opportunities to derive financial benefits from CEP (Arora & Cason, 1996; Wagner, 2010). Especially with regard to financial benefits resulting from consumers’ “environmentally informed buying behavior” (Russo & Fouts, 1997, p. 539) and from an increased willingness-to-pay for “green” products advertising intensity may have a substantial moderating effect (Wagner, 2010).\n\nCapital intensity is another frequently used control variable in CEP–CFP studies (e.g., Elsayed & Paton, 2005; Russo & Fouts, 1997). As capital assets are difficult to adapt to changing purposes.\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al. Making sense of conflicting empirical findings: A meta-analytic review of the relationship between corporate environmental and financial performance. European Management Journal (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2013.12.004\n\nand uses (Miller & Cardinal, 1994), capital-intensive firms may be less flexible and rigid in their maintained procedures, and need more long-term planning horizons (Kukalis, 1991; Miller & Cardinal, 1994). Therefore, firms with high capital intensity may be more reluctant to change their technologies and business models towards more environmentally sound practices (Etzion, 2007; Sharma & Henriques, 2005). Furthermore, capital intensity has been shown to be related to a firm’s cost structure (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999; Fiegenbaum & Karnani, 1991) and may be a determinant of CFP (Capon et al., 1990). Thus, capital intensity may confound the relationship between CEP and CFP.\n\nAside from whether the studies controlled for potential determinants of the CEP–CFP link, the study findings may also depend on whether a study controlled for the possible endogeneity of CEP on CFP. Endogeneity occurs in cases where the independent variable in a regression model is correlated with the error term, or due to simultaneous causality between the dependent and the independent variable (Sánchez-Ballesta & García-Meca, 2007; van Essen et al., in press).
