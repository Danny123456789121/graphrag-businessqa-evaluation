Moreover, a potential effective way of managing a company's environmental policy is by socially linking it with purchasing function activities (Humphreys et al., 2004), for instance, selecting and collaborating with green supplier (C20) focuses on the buyer-supplier relationship where close relationship is necessary and capabilities are required (Sarkis and Talluri, 2002). At the same time, enhancing environmental awareness (C21) can be used to prevent negative impacts on the environment, as well as affecting the strategic development and their corporate reputation (Matos and Hall, 2007; Eltayeb et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2019a).\n\n# 3. Method\n\n# 3.1. Fuzzy cluster method\n\nThis study applies FCM to categorize the proposed SRM criteria into several corresponding CS aspects. Supposing the raw cluster matrix is R = [rij]n×n, where rij denotes the degree of experts' judgement, which can be stated as the following equation.\n\nSubsequently, the entropy associated with each item can be calculated by means of the following equation.\n\nWhere r represents the entropy for each indicator. If an indicator has smaller r, it has higher weight (Ding et al., 2017).\n\n# L.

Vague set\n\nGiven that there are a set of criteria c = {c1, c2, …, cγ}, and the group of experts can be expressed as {d | 1 ≤ t ≤ n}, thereinto, n refers to the number of experts inside group. Initially, the original assessment information was present in the form of linguistic preference, such as very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), low (L) and very low (VL). Then the qualitative information must be transferred into corresponding vague value, as shown in Table 1. After obtaining the vague assessment matrix, pijt was adopted to represent the transferred vague assessment result of expert d t t = [E αβt, Fαβt]γ×γ, where 0 ≤ Eαβt ≤ Fαβt ≤ 1. Detailly, on criterion ci of cj, meanwhile, pijt was present with vague set, i.e. p ij.\n\nSubsequently, this study applies the calculated entropy weight in Section 3.2 to calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix Z, which can be stated as the following equation:\n\nZ7 [ z ]7 ij rE× S (21) After acquiring the weighted normalized decision matrix, the positive ideal solution x + and the negative ideal solution x − are determined by Eq.
