Effective holistic sustainable supply management schemes require the evaluation and selection of suppliers. Supplier evaluation requires the balancing of multiple criteria. Multiple criteria tools, each with advantages and limitations, are necessary for the supplier evaluation and selection problem. This paper introduces a new methodological approach including complementary, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques and Bayesian networks (BN). The combination of DEMATEL, AHP and Bayesian approaches, although they are supportive and complementary methods, has seen limited investigation. The Bayesian network approach can complement DEMATEL and AHP to help improve the accuracy of AHP input data. Alternatively, DEMATEL and AHP can provide expert and more objective inputs for intangible factors, used in the Bayesian network approach. The validity and efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a real industrial case using decision-makers’ inputs and outputs. The study shows the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we present results with managerial and research implications and future research directions.\n\n# Keywords\n\nBayesian network; AHP; DEMATEL; sustainable supplier evaluation; supplier selection; supply chain management\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nIn today’s business environment, most organizations have realized the critical nature of the relationship with suppliers and the importance of the strategic decision to evaluate and choose the best suppliers. Thus, many organizations refer to their suppliers as partners. On the other hand, organizations need to coordinate all their business activities, considering sustainability issues to gain competitive advantages [1]. Therefore, this relationship is no longer based on economic aspects.\n\nSelecting a supplier is a strategic decision from multiple perspectives including customer satisfaction, technological ability and general business performance. Expanding this issue through sustainable supply chain management makes the choice and evaluation of suppliers even more critical and complex. Not surprisingly, the literature on sustainability and supplier selection (SS) is increasing. If selecting a supplier is a complex issue, selecting a sustainable supplier is even more complex. The dimensions to consider increase geometrically. New techniques that provide insightful knowledge and practical tools are required.\n\nThe implementation of sustainable practices is affected by different external factors. Ref. [1] stressed the necessity to be more involved not only in the internal process but also including\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 10584; doi:10.3390/su122410584\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584\n\nthe inter-organizational business systems and relationship with partners along the supply chain. Moreover, the implementation of sustainable initiatives is a complicated task without the cooperation with all partners in supply chain network. Therefore, the selection of suppliers based on integrated sustainability criteria using relevant methods can help companies to improve their sustainability performance. However, many present decision-making models regarding supplier selection focus on economic and environmental issues and less on social factors [2].\n\nMany studies have reviewed the literature on supplier selection (SS) [3–5]. Indeed, the literature on supplier selection is extensive. Multiple criteria decision-making model (MCDM), mathematical programming (MP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are some of the more popular approaches [6]. MCDM provides a methodological framework for decision support systems; MP is used to optimize or evaluate SS; AI identifies approximate solutions for complex optimization problems. MCDM approaches are the most popular, and within MCDM, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is most often applied [7]. AHP is very effective in ranking and selecting decision problems. It could be used alone or combined with other methods. Interaction and interdependent relationships among the evaluation criteria are critical and should be considered in order to evaluate a sustainable supplier [8]. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) can be valuable for this purpose.\n\nIn practical decision-making situations, the supplier selection problem is uncertain and imprecise. In risk assessment, researchers consider Bayesian network (BN) analysis as a helpful methodology for decision support under uncertainty. Although Bayesian analysis has been used for this issue [9], BN has not been used.\n\nMore precisely, more efforts are needed to take advantage of efficient techniques for selecting sustainable supplier in real cases [9]. In this sense, this research aims to answer the following research question: how to improve sustainable supplier selection and evaluation by using complementary approaches?\n\nGiven this situation, this study has the following objectives to answer the identified research question:\n\n- To provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem;\n- To propose a new decision-making tool using combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods in an uncertain environment for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers;\n- To validate the proposed approach in a real case and provide some managerial and research insights.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature about supplier selection (SS) and sustainability in order to provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem. AHP, DEMATEL and BN for supplier selection problems will be the focus. The new approach, AHP-DEMATEL-BN,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
