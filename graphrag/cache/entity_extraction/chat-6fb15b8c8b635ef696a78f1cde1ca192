To maintain integrity in one’s work, tools to identify and add citations to AI-generated content should be considered. Additionally, it is important to recognize that generative models do not consider the concept of confidence when responding to questions, so additional research may be necessary to verify the accuracy of the data generated by these models [44, 45].\n\nAlthough GAI tools have the potential to be used ethically, it is important to be aware of their potential shortcomings and conduct due diligence on the frameworks used to develop them. Consideration should be given to intellectual property rights when developing products using GAI [46, 47]. Some models “reproduce” the content they draw from, which can lead to a situation where a license for a particular piece of code is mistakenly “generated” as a new solution. Because of this, copyright protection is an important issue. Moreover, ownership and rights may be affected due to the data used in developing these systems [48, 49]. Even though third-party developers use GAI, you might\n\n# 11. Conclusions\n\nDespite the impressive results of GAI, it is still not yet clear that this technology is ready for prime time. Many ethical and practical issues still need to be resolved before it can be considered a viable technology. It is important to note that reinforcement learning systems designed to detect and correct biases can still make mistakes. For instance, ChatGPT, a chatbot, sometimes produces completely inaccurate information after responding to a user’s query. It lacks a built-in mechanism to challenge or warn the user if this results in an error. In addition, filters are still not yet effective at catching inappropriate content. For instance, an image-generating app that lets users create avatars from photos could still display inappropriate content even though they had the appropriate images. One of the challenges companies face when integrating GAI technology into their operations is the lack of consistency across different company values and norms. Addressing this issue requires a long-term approach that involves significant investments in computing power and technical expertise. Due to the nature of GAI models, intellectual property issues are still being debated. These AI tools can predict the next content that will be used in each sentence or design or image. These tools do not have a database of facts to draw on. Instead, they can make plausible-sounding claims. According to GPT-3 of OpenAI, the company’s AI tools can make false claims due to how plausible sentences are not always true. Here, we tried to offer a framework that is interpretive, interactive, and immersive in all applications. The success of GAI applications depends on their ability to engage their users in a more productive manner. This can be achieved through the development of interactive features that allow them to share knowledge and ideas.\n\n# Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, V.G.V., S.M. and S.D.; methodology, S.D.; theoretical model, V.G.V. and S.M.; investigation, S.M. and V.G.V.; writing—original draft preparation, S.D.; writing—review and editing, S.D. and V.G.V.; visualization, S.D.; supervision, V.G.V.
