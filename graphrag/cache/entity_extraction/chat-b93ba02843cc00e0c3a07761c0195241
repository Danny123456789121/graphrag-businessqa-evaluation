Employees are likely to be alienated if they infer that they are being managed or represented by these technologies or algorithms. We hypothesise that most employees prefer to be managed and represented by people, with whom they can discuss matters, rather than by impersonal technologies or algorithms.\n\nGiven that many ChatGPT-like innovations will be developed further, affecting ER in varied ways, we encourage ER stakeholders to facilitate employees having a voice in how technologies are used. Depending on the context, this should involve managers consulting with unions or other representatives of employees. Technologies would generally be implemented more equitably, effectively and sustainably if the innovations include transparent co-design and co-regulation that involves employees and their representatives as stakeholders. This should be encouraged to counter the temptation for managers, technocrats, the global big tech firms and consultants to deploy these generative AI-driven tools unilaterally and secretly within a unitary frame of reference.\n\n# 3.3 ChatGPT Talent Management and Advising Managers on Performance Management\n\nArup Varma25 and Angelo DeNisi14\n\nThe proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI enabled tools such as ChatGPT is a welcome development, but also a potential danger to our way of living, if left unharnessed. In this connection, an analysis by Swiss Bank had noted that ChatGPT is the fastest growing app of all time (see Ortiz, 2023). Not surprisingly scholars such as Prikshat et al. (2022) have noted, “AI-augmented HRM can improve workflow and productivity, reduce costs, and increase accuracy in HRM functions.” Indeed, the speed at which AI enabled tools such as ChatGPT are emerging, these applications can help organizations and societies in numerous ways. We believe that organizations that choose to ignore ChatGPT do so at their own peril.\n\nOne area where AI could make major inroads is the critical area of employee performance management given the breadth and scope and the continuing evolution of the function (see, e.g., DeNisi et al., 2021, 2023). Since the performance management function requires raters to make judgments based on copious amounts of qualitative and quantitative data, ChatGPT can prove very useful in terms of processing complex data. However, this is where the danger lies. Since AI enabled tools such as ChatGPT rely on the information available to it, organizations need to be very cautious and deliberate in what information is available to the bot.\n\nA couple of recent examples help illustrate the need for caution. In one case, Sydney, an AI-enabled bot, tried to convince a New York Times writer to leave his spouse (see Wolf, 2023). In another equally bizarre outcome, Google's rival to ChatGPT, Bard, suggested that Google is a monopoly, and the government should step in and break it up (see Prakash, 2023). The point is that when it comes to using ChatGPT for performance management, organizations and human resource managers need to step up their game and monitor and control both formal information and informal chatter within their organizations. If HR managers are willing and able to step up and meet the ChatGPT challenge, they can use ChatGPT to their advantage, when it comes to performance management.\n\nIndeed, we would like to urge HR practitioners to be proactive and help identify facets of performance management where the bot could help managers (who are typically the ones doing the ratings) do a better job. Recently, a company called Confirm (see Parisi, 2023) has experimented with using ChatGPT in their performance management process – specifically for performance reviews. Their experience has been promising – the bot was very successful in writing performance reviews by asking pointed questions of colleagues of the ratee. However, as the CEO of Confirm cautioned, ChatGPT is not ready to give feedback to individual employees, yet. We would hasten to add that the bot\n\nBUDHWAR et al. 23\n\nshould probably not be giving feedback anytime soon, as performance management is a human process and should stay as such – meaning that the bot should assist individual managers in doing their jobs as supervisors, not replace them.\n\nSimilarly, one of the concerns often expressed by scholars of performance management (see DeNisi & Murphy, 2017) is the failure of performance management scholars and practitioners to establish a clear link between individual performance and organization-level outcomes. Perhaps ChatGPT could help address this issue by helping organizations map individual level performance with organizational outcomes through analysing performance-related information and investigating how the various pieces of individual performance fit in with organization level outcomes. Of course, as we know, currently this link is tenuous at best, with the intervening step being more of a black hole whereby information is fed, and outcomes decided though the mechanism through which the data are transformed into individual outcomes is questionable. We believe this presents a tremendous opportunity for scholars of performance management to lead the field proactively rather than simply conducting post-hoc studies.\n\nIndeed, given that ChatGPT is in its nascent stage, there are several other facets of performance management that beg scholarly investigations. First, the level of comfort of the rater with technology and his/her willingness to incorporate ChatGPT in the PM process could determine the degree to which the bot can assist organizations. Next, it is well known that performance management is fertile ground for bias and bots such as these can exacerbate this problem. Indeed, there are studies that show that interacting with bots and other AI enabled tools increases the tendency of human beings to engage in unethical behaviours (see, e.g., Kim et al., 2022). Thus, the ethical aspects of the use of the bot should be investigated (see also, Varma, Dawkins, & Chaudhuri, 2022).\n\nRelatedly, it is well-known that supervisor-subordinate relationships play a critical role in the determination\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
