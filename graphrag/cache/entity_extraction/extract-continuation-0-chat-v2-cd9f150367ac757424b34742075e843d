The population correlations (rs) were calculated by means of random effects models. Conﬁdence intervals were calculated at the 95 % level. To assess the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, Q B statistics were calculated (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Subgroup analysis was used in order to examine potential moderation effects (Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The complete samples for both positive and negative events were divided into subgroups referring to potential moderation effects and calculated separate meta-analyses for these subgroups (King et al. 2004).\n\nFirst, the sample was split by distinguishing studies focusing on US firms and studies examining non-US firms. Although the majority of studies focused on US firms, scholars have recently begun to use samples drawn from other geographical regions (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012). Several factors which are likely to affect the market reactions to CEP-related events may originate from country-specific differences with regard to economic, social, legal, or political aspects. For instance, the level of a country’s economic development has been shown to determine the general degree and enforcement of environmental regulations (Dinda 2004; Grossman and Krueger 1995), which may influence the extent to which environmental issues constitute potential threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). Moreover, general attitudes concerning environmental issues that may affect investors’ reactions to CEP-related events strongly depend on national contexts (e.g., Baughn et al. 2007; Kilbourne et al. 2002).\n\nSecond, the studies were distinguished between studies examining events that occurred before the year 2000 and studies examining events that have occurred since the year 2000. Environmental issues have been gaining momentum throughout the last decades in both academic research and business practice. For example, Jermier et al. (2006) surveyed scholarly journals cataloged in the ABI/Inform Global database and observed an increase of more than 300 % in the number of publications related to the field of organizations and the natural environment from the period 1990–1994 to 2000–2004. Furthermore, from 1995 to 2012, the size of the US SRI market, measured in total.\n\nIn cases of sample periods involving years before and after the year 2000, the studies were coded according to the main emphasis of the sample period.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GUARDIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Guardian is a British news organization known for its journalism and reporting on various topics including environmental issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A scholarly journal that publishes research related to environmental economics and management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal that focuses on ethical issues related to business practices and corporate governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A leading academic journal that publishes research on management and organizational studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal that publishes research on operations management and related fields.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal that focuses on the integration of ecological and economic principles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A journal that publishes research in the field of economics, particularly in the southern United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINLAND<|>GEO<|>A Nordic country in Northern Europe known for its high standard of living and strong environmental policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|>GEO<|>The United States, a country in North America known for its significant influence on global economics and environmental policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA<|>GEO<|>A country in North America known for its vast natural resources and commitment to environmental conservation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>GEO<|>The European Union, a political and economic union of member states located primarily in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>A country in South Asia known for its diverse culture and growing economy, facing significant environmental challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>A country in East Asia, the world's most populous country, facing severe environmental issues due to rapid industrialization.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian publishes articles that may reference studies from the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian often discusses topics related to business ethics, which are covered in the Journal of Business Ethics<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian may report on findings published in the Academy of Management Journal<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian may reference studies from the Journal of Operations Management in its reporting<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian covers environmental issues that are often discussed in Ecological Economics<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian may reference economic studies from the Southern Economic Journal<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINLAND<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian reports on environmental policies and practices in Finland<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian covers news and events related to the US, including environmental issues<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANADA<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian reports on environmental policies and issues in Canada<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian covers environmental regulations and policies within the EU<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian reports on environmental challenges and policies in India<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>GUARDIAN<|>The Guardian covers environmental issues and policies in China<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
