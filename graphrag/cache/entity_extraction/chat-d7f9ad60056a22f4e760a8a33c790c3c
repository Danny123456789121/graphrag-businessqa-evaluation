The methodological moderators are fairly straightforward: financial performance measures were coded as either profitability (e.g., ROA) or market (e.g., market share); emissions measures included TRI, air pollution measures, waste disposal, etc.; and\n\n# Results\n\nTable 1 provides the meta-analytic results for the overall relationship between CEP and CFP. Similar to Orlitzky et al. (2003), results indicate it does pay to be green, with a mean correlation of 0.062 (71 samples, n = 22,869, p < 0.001). In order to establish a consensus between our baseline CEP–CFP relationship findings and that of prior meta-analytic literature, we further examine the similarities between the Orlitzky et al. (2003) sample of 17 studies prior to 1997 and our additional sample of 54 and find no statistical differences (Q = 0.31, p = 0.58). With similar results in the CEP–CFP relationship established, we extend our analysis to include the potential moderating effects of environmental performance type, firm-specific characteristics, and methodological issues to determine when and how it pays to be green.\n\n# Reactive Versus Proactive Environmental Strategies\n\nAs previously noted, there are many environmental performance strategies incorporated by firms and examined throughout literature. For the purposes of this study, we focus on comparing the subgroup of reactive versus proactive environmental strategy measures in regards to their influence on the relation between environmental performance and firm financial performance, as well as comparing to measures reflecting both proactive and reactive initiatives simultaneously. Table 1 provides the results for each of the moderating variables and their subgroups. Contrary to our expectations, results indicate there is not a significant moderating effect in terms of the influences of proactive (r = 0.06) versus reactive (r = 0.07) environmental strategies on CEP (Q = 0.93, p = 0.63). Firms appear to benefit similarly, in terms of financial performance, from pursuing either proactive or reactive initiatives. Proactive strategies, surprisingly, do not appear to lead to greater financial returns than reactive approaches. Interestingly, firms pursuing both proactive and reactive strategies seem to benefit similarly to firms pursuing either one or the other strategy.\n\n# Firm Characteristics\n\nAnother potential set of moderating variables affecting the CEP–CFP relationship is firm-specific characteristics. We analyze this relationship by forming subgroups of small versus large firms, public versus private firms, US-based versus internationally based firms, and worst environmental offenders versus the inclusion of a broader set of firms. In meta-analyzing the effect of firm size, we attempt to answer whether the benefits of environmental performance are different for large firms as opposed to small firms. In support of our expectations, results indicate there is a significant difference between samples of large firms versus small firms (Q = 5.91, p = 0.02). Samples including small firms have a greater effect on the correlation between CEP and CFP (r = 0.074) than those that only include large firms (r = 0.04). However, there does not seem to be a significant difference between public versus private firms (Q = 0.75, p = 0.39). The correlation between private firms CEP and CFP (r = 0.08) is not significantly different than the relationship between public firms CEP and CFP (r = 0.06).\n\nA firm’s country of residence includes specific economic, social, legal, and political factors that may significantly influence a firm’s environmental performance. In order to assess the influence of these cross-border environmental differences, we examine these subgroups separately. As reported in Table 1, there is a significant difference in the moderating ability of US-based firms versus internationally based firms (Q = 4.47, p = 0.04). Specifically, US firms appear to benefit more (r = 0.07) than international counterparts (-0.01). Consequently, our\n\n# Table 1 Corporate environmental performance and corporate financial performance moderators mixed-effects model\n\n|Overall|Number of samples|SE|95% Confidence intervals|Q|p|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Overall|71|0.0622|0.050–0.080|9.4|0.000|\n|Moderators| | | | | |\n|Environmental strategy| | | | | |\n|Proactive|23|0.070|0.050–0.091|6.05|0.000|\n|Reactive|40|0.057|0.039–0.076|6.64|0.000|\n|Both|8|0.057|0.019–0.096|2.92|0.000|\n|Firm characteristics| | | | | |\n|Large firms|33|0.040|0.017–0.062|5.91|0.000|\n|Small firms|38|0.074|0.058–0.090|9.06|0.000|\n|Public firms|45|0.061|0.047–0.080|8.32|0.000|\n|Private firms|24|0.077|0.044–0.110|4.50|0.000|\n|International|11|-0.013|-0.084 to 0.058|-0.36|0.720|\n|Domestic|60|0.065|0.052–0.078|9.62|0.000|\n|Worst offenders|19|0.052|0.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
