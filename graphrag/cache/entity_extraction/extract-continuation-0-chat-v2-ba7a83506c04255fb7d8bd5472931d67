However, this difference is small and fails statistical significance (p-value of the difference is 0.388). Thus, Hypothesis 2a is rejected. Opposite to a common notion in the literature, our findings propose that good CSP pays, whether social or environmental related.\n\nWithin CSP dimensions, CSP reputation yields the highest relation (pb i = 0.318). The difference to the group average of CSP measures of b̿p = 0.225 is significantly higher at the 99% level (z-value 2.66). However, when we adjust for the 0.80 reliability factor (Table 4, column 12), CSP reputation is marginally adjusted towards pbir = 0.299 to account for the second-order sampling error. Thus, we confirm Hypothesis 2b\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CSP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSP refers to Corporate Social Performance, a concept related to the social responsibility of corporations and their impact on society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CFP stands for Corporate Financial Performance, which measures the financial outcomes of a company's operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSP REPUTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSP Reputation is a dimension of Corporate Social Performance that reflects how a company is perceived in terms of its social responsibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSP DIMENSIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CSP Dimensions refer to various aspects of Corporate Social Performance, including social and environmental factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL CSP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Environmental CSP focuses on a company's environmental impact and sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL CSP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Social CSP emphasizes a company's contributions to social welfare and community engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS 2A<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis 2A is a research proposition that examines the relationship between social CSP and its financial implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPOTHESIS 2B<|>EVENT<|>Hypothesis 2B is a research proposition that investigates the relationship between CSP reputation and its financial performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP<|>CFP<|>CSP and CFP are related as they both measure different aspects of corporate performance, one focusing on social responsibility and the other on financial outcomes.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CSP REPUTATION<|>CSP DIMENSIONS<|>CSP Reputation is a key aspect of CSP Dimensions, indicating how reputation affects overall corporate social performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL CSP<|>SOCIAL CSP<|>Environmental CSP and Social CSP are two dimensions of Corporate Social Performance that reflect different areas of corporate responsibility.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPOTHESIS 2A<|>HYPOTHESIS 2B<|>Hypothesis 2A and Hypothesis 2B are related as they both explore the relationships between different dimensions of CSP and their financial implications.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
