Our study presents a review of academic research on this topic by applying a second-order meta-analysis. The data sample combines 25 previous meta-analyses yielding a sample size of one million observations. Our results demonstrate a highly significant, positive, robust, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation. The relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key CSP determinant. We find a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation for operational CFP. Furthermore, we add a new perspective on potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: social issues-oriented journals and methodological weaker papers do not distort the positive CSP-CFP relation. Our conclusion is: Based on the extant literature, the business case for being a good firm is undeniable. © 2018 The Authors.

For nearly 50 years, scholars have investigated this question. The search for the answer has become particularly prominent since the end of the 1990s. Our study sample comprises 1214 empirical primary studies on the CSP-CFP relation. While considerable research has been conducted, it is as yet less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and in which way various moderating factors determine the CSP-CFP relation (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Peloza, 2009). Moreover, the robustness of the business case over time has only occasionally been analyzed (Borgers, Derwall, Koedijk, & ter Horst, 2013; Derwall, Koedijk, & Ter Horst, 2011). The aim of this study is to provide a more detailed understanding of the CSP-CFP relation.\n\n*Correspondence to: Timo Busch, University of Hamburg, School of Business, Economics and Social Science, Hamburg, Germany.

Busch and G. Friede\n\nIn 2003, the widely cited Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) meta-study responded to calls for a moratorium on CSP-CFP research (Margolis & Walsh, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Orlitzky et al. (2003) found a significant, positive, and bidirectional correlation of CSP with CFP. Despite these findings, the authors claim that this relation cannot be generalized across all CSP dimensions and CFP categories, detecting a large variability – even after correcting for sampling error and measurement error. Since then, the picture has become even more ambiguous and critical debates have resurfaced about the actual CSP-CFP relation (Aldag, 2013; Barnett, 2007; Borgers et al., 2013; Devinney, 2009; Fleming & Jones, 2013; Orlitzky, 2011, 2013; Wood, 2010). On the one hand, many scholars claim that, to date, the literature on the CSP-CFP relation remains inconclusive. On the other hand, a whole range of new studies and further meta-analyses have been published supporting a positive relation. Thus, more than a decade after Orlitzky et al. (2003), it seems to be the right time to revive the paper’s spirit and ask: when generalizing existing research, is there still evidence that it pays off to be a good firm?\n\nTo answer this question, we apply a second-order meta-analysis.
