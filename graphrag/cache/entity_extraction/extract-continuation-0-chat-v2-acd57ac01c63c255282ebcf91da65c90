Value-weighted Annual Impact (%) Estimates\n\nThe economy-wide average impact on the cost of equity capital is obtained by multiplying the temperature shock factor risk premium (from Table 3) by the weighted average loading on this factor. We use the market value weights and loadings of the 55 industry and size-value sorted portfolios. The weight is obtained by dividing the market value of each portfolio by the sum of the market values of the 55 portfolios. The loadings on the alternative versions of TSF are obtained as in Table 4. Panel A shows the value-weighted impact for the entire sample period.\n\nFollowing Cooper, Gutierrez and Hameed (2004), we estimate in Panel B the impact of the temperature shock factor in two sub-sample periods with the following regression:\n\nIMPACT = i83−98D83−98 + i99−14D99−14 + et\n\nwhere IMPACT is the impact in month t estimated based on 30-year rolling samples. Since our first observation is in t 1953:4, the first estimate is for 1983:4. It uses the construction of the TSF and loadings on this factor for the period 1953:4-1983:3 and multiplies the value-weighted loadings by the TSF realization for 1983:4 to obtain IMPACT1983:4. We then roll everything forward by a month to find IMPACT1983:5, etc. D83-98 is equal to 1 for all months in the period 1983-1998 and zero otherwise, and D99-14 is equal to 1 for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COOPER<|>PERSON<|>Cooper is one of the authors referenced in the manuscript discussing the impact of temperature shock factors on equity capital.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUTIERREZ<|>PERSON<|>Gutierrez is one of the authors referenced in the manuscript discussing the impact of temperature shock factors on equity capital.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAMEED<|>PERSON<|>Hameed is one of the authors referenced in the manuscript discussing the impact of temperature shock factors on equity capital.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 5<|>EVENT<|>Table 5 presents the value-weighted annual impact estimates on the cost of equity capital due to temperature shock factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 3<|>EVENT<|>Table 3 provides the temperature shock factor risk premium used in the analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 4<|>EVENT<|>Table 4 shows the loadings on the alternative versions of the temperature shock factor.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COOPER<|>GUTIERREZ<|>Cooper and Gutierrez are co-authors of the manuscript discussing the impact of temperature shock factors on equity capital<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COOPER<|>HAMEED<|>Cooper and Hameed are co-authors of the manuscript discussing the impact of temperature shock factors on equity capital<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUTIERREZ<|>HAMEED<|>Gutierrez and Hameed are co-authors of the manuscript discussing the impact of temperature shock factors on equity capital<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 5<|>TABLE 3<|>Table 5 uses data from Table 3 to estimate the impact of temperature shock factors<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 5<|>TABLE 4<|>Table 5 uses loadings from Table 4 to calculate the impact of temperature shock factors<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
