People tend to stereotype information depending on its source (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), so decision makers with a business case frame will attend less to environmental and social issues brought forward by stakeholders having no direct impact.\n\npact on their business. For instance, in the 1970s General Motors’ upper management did not consider many suggestions for smaller, less pollut-ing cars because they were brought forward by groups outside the scope of the executives’ focus (Wright, 1979). Consequently, managers with a business case frame will not take full notice of the multitude of sustainability issues and claims that arise in their organizational contexts. The more the frames of decision makers focus on economic attributes and an alignment logic, the more decision makers tend to perceive issues only once these have progressed to later stages of the issue life cycle—that is, when actors with direct business relevance, such as regulators or competitors, have adopted the issue (Mahon & Waddock, 1992; Wartick & Mahon, 1994).\n\nWhile the business case frame limits the breadth of managerial scanning, it enables managers to approach decision situations with known objectives (Das & Teng, 1999). Following an alignment logic, managers probe the environmental and social aspects they notice for potential economic benefits. With this narrow focus the business case frame provides clear direction and reduces uncertainties regarding which aspects managers should look for (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). The clear focus on the business relevance of sustainability issues allows managers to employ highly formalized and clearly structured search routines to collect detailed information (Das & Teng, 1999). Consequently, we expect that managers with a business case frame will be more likely to collect detailed information on how selected sustainability issues contribute to financial performance. Overall, we argue that the business case frame will lead managers to notice rather few sustainability issues but to seek detailed information, based on readily available, quantitative information at advanced stages of the issue life cycle, on how selected aspects of these issues relate to financial outcomes (see Figure 2).\n\n# Proposition 1a:\n\nThe more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a narrow range of sustainability issues based on focused search with little breadth, but with detailed information on how these issues relate to economic objectives.\n\n# FIGURE 2\n\nEffects of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame on Scanning\n\n|Paradoxical frame| | |\n|---|---|---|\n|3|Plb|P3|\n|1|P2b|Functional background|\n|3|Availability of time and resources| |\n| |Business case| |\n|P2a| | |\n|3|Low|Detail of scanning|\n|High| | |\n\nThe paradoxical frame does not direct decision makers toward clearly defined objectives and previously formed hypotheses about one specific type of relationship between different sustainability aspects. Rather, we expect managers with this frame to have a less selective perception of sustainability issues (Beyer et al., 1997). With their more complex frame structure and frame content comprising more diverse economic, environmental, and social attributes, decision makers will scan more broadly and attend to a wider range of aspects of sustainability issues, even if they are contradictory. Moreover, as Stabell argued, decision makers with complex frames will tend “to combine the information from a wide variety of information sources as the individual is able to generate perspectives that can integrate such a diversity of information” (1997: 720). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame will thus gather more diverse information on sustainability issues—that is, information related to economic, environmental, and social aspects—irrespective of immediate financial implications (Byrch et al., 2007). Because they hold a more complex conceptualization of their business (Crilly & Sloan, 2012), they will gather quantitative and qualitative, as well as financial and nonfinancial, information. They will also take note of opinions held by a wider range of stakeholders (Daft & Lengel, 1986; Wong, Ormiston, & Tetlock, 2011) and notice signals from diffuse sources with little or no immediate relevance.\n\n2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 471\n\ndiate business relevance, as well as from earlier stages of the issue life cycle (Halme, 2002; Wartick & Mahon, 1994). Since the structure of the paradoxical frame encompasses conflicting relations between different sustainability dimensions, decision makers will be more likely to notice redundant and inconsistent information. Their information collection will be less structured and less formalized, because increasing formalization “constrains the information that decision makers can take into account” (Heidmann, Schäffer, & Strahringer, 2008: 246). For instance, biodiversity represents an issue that is still at an early stage in its life cycle, and managers struggle with how to make sense of it (Financial Times, 2012). Since biodiversity relates to many different ecological processes, managers need to scan beyond traditional business sources to comprehend the complexity of the issue. Hence, the CEO of global cement firm Holcim initiated a partnership in 2007 with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an environmental NGO dedicated to biodiversity, to collect independent expert opinion on the relevance of biodiversity for Holcim (Imboden, Gross, Meynell, Richards, & Stalmans, 2010).\n\nHowever, the paradoxical frame does not emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, so it does not provide an unequivocal direction for information collection. Scanning might be broad, but also rather vague, since breadth comes at the expense of detailed information search (Das &\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERAL MOTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes vehicles and vehicle parts, and is known for its influence in the automotive industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLCIM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Holcim is a global cement firm that has initiated partnerships to address sustainability issues, particularly biodiversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an environmental NGO dedicated to biodiversity and sustainable development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIODIVERSITY<|>EVENT<|>Biodiversity refers to the variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem, and is a key issue in sustainability discussions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLCIM<|>INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE<|>Holcim partnered with IUCN to gather expert opinions on biodiversity's relevance for their operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERAL MOTORS<|>BIODIVERSITY<|>General Motors has historically overlooked sustainability issues like biodiversity due to a narrow focus on economic attributes<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
