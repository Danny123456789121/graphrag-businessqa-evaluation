This table shows the results from the publication bias test for the CEP–CFP relation. Data are split according to the number of lagged years j between the two constructs. n is the number of studies, and k is the number of effect sizes. Besides, the estimates and their standard errors are shown for β0 and β1. The observations are weighted by inverse standard errors. Standard errors of the meta‐analysis are clustered at the study level. CEP: corporate environmental performance; CFP: corporate financial performance.\n\naDue to the small number of observed effect estimates, the calculations cannot be performed completely for this subgroup.\n\n*Significant at 10% level; **Significant at 5% level; ***Significant at 1% level.\n\n(Albertini, 2013; Dixon‐Fowler et al., 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Guenther et al., 2012; Horváthová, 2010). The set of variables is listed in the first column of Table 5 together with their descriptive statistics in columns two and three. After selecting the relevant moderating variables, these are included as additional explanatory variables in a meta‐regression analysis as an extension of Equation (6).\n\nBased on the primary studies in our sample, we designed the following moderating factors including measurement differences, study quality characteristics, temporal differences, regional differences, industrial differences, data characteristics, and estimation characteristics. Following previous meta‐analyses, among the measurement differences, we classify financial performance measures in market‐based (Tobin's Q, stock return, or market value of a firm) and accounting‐based (return on assets, return on equity, or return on sales). The two measures especially differ in terms of their forward‐looking properties, which are more present in market‐based measures compared with the backward‐looking properties of accounting‐based measures. Market‐based CFP takes on the value of one if a study uses a market‐based CFP measure and zero otherwise. Furthermore, the CEP measurement is categorized by its strategic level and quantifiability. Process‐based measures refer to CEP on a management or process level. These measures cover management practices, environmental policies, or environmental innovation. On the other hand, outcome‐based measures refer to real impacts of these efforts by measuring the amount of emissions, the ratio of recycled waste to total waste, or energy consumption. Process‐based CEP takes on the value of one if a study uses a process‐based CEP measure and zero otherwise. Additionally, proactive measures refer to pollution prevention through green process design, special capabilities, or resource combinations of the firm (Walls, Phan, & Berrone, 2011). On the contrary, “end‐of‐pipe solutions” such as air filters or water clearers to comply with regulations and laws in order to minimize costs, risks, and liabilities are classified as reactive measures. Proactive CEP and reactive CEP take on the value of one for the corresponding measures. The number of citations as derived from Google Scholar serve as a proxy for study quality. In order to capture temporal effects, the mean year of the observation period in a primary study is included, and 1950 is used as base year (mean sample year—1950). Because a major part of the literature analyzes U.S. firms and E.U. firms, we incorporate two corresponding dummy variables to capture regional differences (U.S. data and E.U. data). Similarly, large parts of the literature examine manufacturing and service firms in order to reveal industrial differences. The dummy variables manufacturing sector and service sector take on the value\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\n# TABLE 5 Results of meta‐regression analysis\n\nDependent variable: partial correlation coefficient of CEP–CFP r\n\n|Independent variables|Mean|Standard deviation|Bayesian model averaging|WLS|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Standard error of r|0.091|0.054|−0.011|0.057|\n|Process‐based CEP|0.432|0.495|−0.007|0.014|\n|Market‐based CFP|0.308|0.462|0.011|0.018|\n|Proactive CEP|0.408|0.491|0.000|0.004|\n|Reactive CEP|0.068|0.252|−0.082|0.036|\n|Number of citations|155.046|321.549|0.000|0.000|\n|Mean sample year−1950|50.232|7.453|−0.006|0.001|\n|U.S. data|0.340|0.474|0.015|0.024|\n|E.U. data|0.199|0.399|−0.007|0.017|\n|Manufacturing sector|0.402|0.490|0.001|0.006|\n|Service sector|0.382|0.486|−0.005|0.013|\n|Small firms|0.233|0.423|0.019|0.024|\n|OLS estimation|0.321|0.467|0.004|0.011|\n|Endogeneity considered|0.429|0.495|0.000|0.003|\n|Constant|0.074|0.186|0.351|NA|\n|Observations|893|893|893|893|\n\nNote.
