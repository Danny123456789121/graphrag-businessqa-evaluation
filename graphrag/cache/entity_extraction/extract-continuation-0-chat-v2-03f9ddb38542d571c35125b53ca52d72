Using the STIRPAT model, similar evidence was obtained by York (2007), who further argued that even in the most modernized nations, urbanization contributes to the growth of energy use. Following a similar model, Cole and Neumayer (2004) found that urbanization increases CO2 emissions. On the other hand, Mishra et al. (2009) reported that the relationship between urbanization and per capita energy was negative in New Caledonia, but positive in Fiji, French Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga. Using the EKC model and OECD data, Liddle (2004) found that urbanization and population density negatively affect per capita road transport energy use, implying that populous and highly urbanized societies have less demand for personal transport.\n\nIn terms of analysis at the city level, Newman and Kenworthy (1989) examined the relationship between urban density and transport energy use using data on 32 cities in high-income countries, and found that high urban density is associated with less per capita transport energy use. Likewise, Chen et al. (2008) investigated the impact of urban compaction on household energy use using Chinese city data, concluding a negative link between urban density and per.\n\nP. Poumanyvong, S. Kaneko / Ecological Economics 70 (2010) 434–444\n\ncapita household energy consumption. Moreover, Dodman (2009) Concerning the relationship between urbanization and emissions, the found that per capita greenhouse gas emissions of several wealthy cities were significantly lower than their national average for two reasons. The first is that most of these cities have highly dense building forms with small average dwelling sizes. These require less energy to heat, light and cool than those in suburban or rural areas. The second reason is that these cities have extensive public transport systems with lower car ownership levels than the national average. Similarly, Dhakal et al. (2002) reported that per capita CO2 emissions were lower in cities at a higher development stage (Tokyo and Seoul) than in those at a lower development stage (Beijing and Shanghai).\n\n# 3. Empirical Model and Methodology\n\n# 3.1. Empirical Model\n\nThe impact of demographic and economic factors on the environment is largely postulated in the IPAT identity (I=PAT) proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971). The equation denotes I as environmental impact, which is determined by a multiplicative combination of three factors: population size (P), per capita consumption (usually proxied by per capita affluence) (A) and the level of environmentally damaging technology or the impact per unit of economic activity (T). The value of T is often derived from the known values of I, P and A, and is equal to I/(PA) or I/GDP.\n\nThe IPAT model is a very simple and useful framework, yet has two limitations (Dietz and Rosa, 1994). First, it is only a mathematical identity and cannot be used directly to test hypotheses on the impact of each factor on the environment. Second, it simply assumes that the elasticities of environmental impact to population, affluence and technology are unitary. For instance, a 1% increase in per capita income increases environmental impact by 1%. This contradicts the EKC hypothesis, which exhibits an inverted U-shape on the income–environment relationship (World Bank, 1992).\n\nThe IPAT model was later reformulated in the STIRPAT model of Dietz and Rosa (1997), where I = aPibATidu. Here, a is the constant term of the equation, b, c and d are the parameters of A, P and T, respectively, u denotes the disturbance term and subscript i represents the unit of analysis. Importantly, unlike the original IPAT identity, multiple variables other than A and P that influence the impact per unit of economic activity can express T (York et al., 2003b). For instance, Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2007) proxied T with the share of industry in GDP and energy intensity, while Shi (2003) employed the share of the industrial and service sectors in the economy as a proxy. As urbanization is one of the important factors influencing energy use and emissions, several studies included it in the STIRPAT model and estimated its impact on energy use, emissions and energy footprints (Cole and Neumayer, 2004; York et al., 2003a,b; York, 2007).\n\n# 3.2. Methodology\n\nWe employ the STIRPAT model (I = aPibATidu) reformulated by Dietz and Rosa (1997), and add urbanization as an additional variable. After taking natural logarithms of both sides of the model and rearranging, we can write the empirical models for the panel data of total energy use and CO2 emissions as follows.\n\nln Energyit = a0 + a1 ln(Pit) + a2 ln(Ait) + a3 ln(INDit) + a4 ln(SVit) + a5 ln(URBit) + Yt + Ci + u1it (1)\n\nln CO2it = b0 + b1 ln(Pit) + b2 ln(Ait) + b3 ln(INDit) + b4 ln(SVit) + b5 ln(URBit) + b6 ln(EIit) + Yt + Ci + u2it (2)\n\nwhere P denotes population size and A is per capita GDP. As in Shi (2003), in the energy use equation (Eq. (1)), T is proxied with two variables: the share of the industry (IND) and service sectors (SV) in GDP\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW CALEDONIA<|>GEO<|>New Caledonia is a French territory in the South Pacific known for its unique biodiversity and cultural heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIJI<|>GEO<|>Fiji is an island country in the South Pacific known for its tropical climate and vibrant culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH POLYNESIA<|>GEO<|>French Polynesia is a group of islands in the South Pacific, known for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural traditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMOA<|>GEO<|>Samoa is a country consisting of two main islands in the South Pacific, known for its natural beauty and cultural heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONGA<|>GEO<|>Tonga is a Polynesian kingdom in the South Pacific, known for its beautiful beaches and rich cultural history.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOKYO<|>GEO<|>Tokyo is the capital city of Japan, known for its modern architecture, bustling streets, and rich history.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEOUL<|>GEO<|>Seoul is the capital city of South Korea, known for its vibrant culture, technology, and historical sites.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEIJING<|>GEO<|>Beijing is the capital city of China, known for its historical landmarks and rapid modernization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI<|>GEO<|>Shanghai is a global financial hub in China, known for its modern skyline and rich history.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EHRLICH AND HOLDREN<|>PERSON<|>Ehrlich and Holdren are researchers known for proposing the IPAT identity, which relates environmental impact to population, affluence, and technology.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIETZ AND ROSA<|>PERSON<|>Dietz and Rosa are researchers who reformulated the IPAT model into the STIRPAT model, which includes additional variables affecting environmental impact.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CALEDONIA<|>FIJI<|>Both New Caledonia and Fiji are island nations in the South Pacific, contributing to discussions on urbanization and energy use<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CALEDONIA<|>FRENCH POLYNESIA<|>Both New Caledonia and French Polynesia are French territories in the South Pacific, relevant to studies on urbanization and energy consumption<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIJI<|>FRENCH POLYNESIA<|>Both Fiji and French Polynesia are island nations in the South Pacific, often compared in studies of urbanization and energy use<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMOA<|>TONGA<|>Samoa and Tonga are neighboring island nations in the South Pacific, relevant to discussions on urbanization and energy consumption<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOKYO<|>SEOUL<|>Tokyo and Seoul are major cities in East Asia, often studied for their urbanization and energy use patterns<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEIJING<|>SHANGHAI<|>Beijing and Shanghai are major cities in China, frequently analyzed in the context of urbanization and energy consumption<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EHRLICH AND HOLDREN<|>DIETZ AND ROSA<|>Ehrlich and Holdren's IPAT model laid the groundwork for Dietz and Rosa's STIRPAT model, linking environmental impact to demographic factors<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
