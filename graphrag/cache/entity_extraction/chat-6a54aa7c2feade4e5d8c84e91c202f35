The mean values show that three indicators are considered more important, while one indicator is considered less important. “Customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” are found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level with mean values of 4.36, 4.31 and 4.25, respectively. These indicate that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. On the other hand, “marketing communication” is found to be statistically significant at 0.05 level, but its mean value is less than the t-test value, meaning that it is considered less important. The t-test for “Product and service labelling” shows no significant result.\n\nThe overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of society is 4.17 (out of 5), which is higher than the test value of 4.\n\n# 4.4.5 Overall social indicators\n\nThe overall mean value for social indicators is 3.96 (out of 5), which is very close to the t-test value of 4. Hence, H1C can be considered as supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2C, with various detailed results for the indicators.\n\n# 4.5 Overall perceived importance of the sustainability disclosure\n\nThe overall mean value for all indicators of sustainability disclosure is 4.10 (out of 5), which is higher than the t-test value of 4. Hence, H1 is supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2, with various detailed results for the indicators.\n\n# 5. Discussion\n\nIn general, our findings of the users’ perceived importance of CSD indicate that the importance of CSD perceived by the report users in China was partially different from what was intended by GRI. The degrees of difference varied across disclosure categories. Our findings show evidence that there are moderate differences in the Chinese report users’.\n\nperceived importance of environmental, economic and social disclosures from what were intended by the GRI. Environmental disclosure, with an overall mean value of 4.20 (out of 5), was perceived as more important by the users than what was intended by the GRI. Social disclosure, with an overall mean value of 3.96 (out of 5) can be considered as having the same level of importance by the users as what was intended by the GRI and, lastly, economic disclosure with a mean value of 3.79 (out of 5), was perceived as less important by the users than what was intended by the GRI.\n\nAs shown in Table IX, our results overall show consistency with the existing literature in the context, whereas partial differences are apparent comparing with Western individualistic contexts. Looking closer, environmental indicators that received a high level of perceived importance often relate to the most publicly concerning issues, such as energy, water, emission, effluents and waste in environmental disclosure in China. The results are consistent with literature both in China and Western countries. Lu and Abeysekera (2017) and Chow and Chen (2012) both used Chinese data and found that effluents and waste, emission, compliance and energy are significant from report preparers’ end. In our case, as the data were collected in 2014, a series of promotion on the corporate sustainability development was fostered by President Xi because of the change in leadership. While there is no mandatory requirement on corporate sustainability reporting, environmental control such as carbon emission reduction and energy saving have been incorporated in the National Plan and have been continuously promoted in the national Congress Zhang et al. (2018). This can also be influenced by the 12th Five Year Sustainability Plan by the Chinese government, in which companies were encouraged to disclose use of material, energy consumption and general environmental performance. Although adherence to the plan is on a voluntary basis, seemingly users wanted to see information regarding these areas being disclosed in annual and sustainability reports.\n\nWith regard to social disclosure, it is notable that “product responsibility” indicators generally received a high level of perceived importance. Product responsibility is another area of concern in China, because of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
