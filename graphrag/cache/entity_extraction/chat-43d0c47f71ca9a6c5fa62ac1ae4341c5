R2 in the model is 0.61, while the p-value in the model significance test is 0.0001.\n\nIn the last constructed regression model, the Strategic 6 variable is significantly influenced by the Psychological 1 and Psychological 4 variables. R2 in the model is 0.57, while the p-value in the Fisher significance test is 0.0003.\n\nTo sum up, there were 18 independent variables (Social 1–6, Psychological 1–6, Ecological 1–6) analysed. The dependent variables (Strategic 1–6) are influenced by 11 independent ones. Ten of them explain well how only one aspect is developing. On the other hand, Social 1 explains well the shaping of two aspects (strategic 2 and 5). Moreover, the Psychological 4 aspect explains well the shaping of Strategic 4 and 6 aspects.\n\n# 4. Conclusions and Discussion\n\nThe research model adopted in this research has been positively verified, indicating the dual role of the HR department in taking actions in the field of diversity management and developing a sustainable career as well as introducing those actions into the organization’s strategy.\n\nOn the basis of the conducted analysis, it can be concluded that in the surveyed companies, there are moderate and strong correlations between taking actions for various groups of employees and sustainable career development and their introduction to the company’s strategy. Additionally, on the basis of the constructed regression models, it was determined which of the analysed aspects (variables creating the social, psychological, and ecological aspect) significantly affect the strategic aspect. Thus, the adopted research model turned out to be useful in relation to the study of the relationship between the social, psychological, and ecological aspect and the strategic aspect, pointing to the dual role of HR departments. The adopted research model also allowed us to indicate which activities, to the greatest extent, contribute to increasing the effectiveness of HR departments in realizing Sustainable HRM endeavours.\n\nWhen analysing the results obtained in terms of particular aspects of HRM, it can be noticed that they often relate to activities resulting from the existing legal solutions. This applies, inter alia, to activities undertaken for the benefit of various employee groups. By law, elderly, adolescent, disabled, and women employees are entitled to special protection.\n\nIn terms of solutions related to the development of a sustainable professional career of employees, attention should be paid to the economic interest of the organization and certain customary solutions. In recent years, the labour market in Poland has taken on the character of an employee’s market. Due to the difficulty of obtaining qualified employees, employers were forced to incur greater expenditure on employee training.\n\nPodlasie is a relatively poor region. This also applies to companies operating there. This is the most likely explanation for the lack of results indicating the undertaking of pro-ecological activities included in the study. The purchase of green cars or subsidies for employees using public transport are additional costs, which may comprise an impossible barrier for many companies. An additional problem arises in the use of public transport by employees. Some of the smaller towns have rather poor infrastructure and transportation connection, and using their own means of transport is often the only possible means to travel to work. Regarding the statement about organic food offered in canteens, two factors may have influenced the distribution of the response value. Some enterprises, especially smaller ones, may not have their own canteens. Secondly, certified organic food is more expensive than non-organic, which can also be a barrier for companies.\n\nThe results of this part of the research are not unique, as research conducted among Finnish top managers showed that, contrary to the prior green HRM literature, ecological responsibility was largely ignored [34]. Finland, like Poland, has a restrictive legal system with regard to environmental protection, and this may mean that the environmental aspect has automatically become part of the mentality of Finnish companies. Podlaskie is a region whose land is mostly categorized as Natura 2000 areas. This means that entrepreneurs are obliged now to respect strict environmental protection standards. Consequently, it is likely that they are convinced that their compliance with applicable legal norms meets their environmental obligations. However, this is a hypothesis that should be verified in further research.\n\nOn the other hand, another possible explanation for the low environmental aspect correlation can be attributed to the historic disregard for environmental matters. There is a limited amount of\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987\n\nresearch conducted so far covering the environmental problems in Central Europe. Š. Waisova [68] considered environmental governance in the Visegard Group (V4). The group includes four Central European countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and The Czech Republic. The Visegrad countries have a common communist heritage. All were previously regimes with an economic emphasis on the metallurgic industry, mining, and intensive centralized agriculture. Environmental protection and the interest in environmental changes and threats were very low on the priority list for many years in those countries. Because of their geopolitical situation, history, and physical geography, Poland and Hungary in particular are linked to environmental issues that go beyond Central Europe and call for far wider environmental action. Perhaps partially due to the historical footprint, Polish organizations might correlate the lowest with the environmental aspect. However, this hypothesis should be verified in further research.\n\nExisting research on Sustainable HRM includes research by K. Piwowar-Sulej [69] on the development of future competencies of industrial engineers in Poland. This group is responsible for the implementation of Industry 4.0 concept and cleaner production in the country. As K. Piwowar-Sulej’s research suggests, industrial companies in Poland tend to be short-sighted when developing the potential of their engineers.
