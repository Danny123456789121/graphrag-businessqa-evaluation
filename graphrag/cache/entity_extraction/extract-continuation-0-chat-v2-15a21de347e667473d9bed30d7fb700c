Other analyses based on publicly traded environmental portfolios find that green stocks are, on average, underperforming the market. This finding would indicate that investors are willing to earn comparatively less on these assets because they are hedging an environmental long-run risk. Finally, recent papers attempt to build climate risk hedging portfolios (see Engle et al., 2020, Choi et al., 2020, Hong et al., 2019, Alok).\n\nAndersson et al. (2016) shows that divestment in higher emission stocks entails a cost, which investors are more likely to bear the stronger the perception of a serious commitment on the side of policymakers towards fighting climate change.\n\net al., 2020 and Goergen et al., 2019, Monasterolo and De Angelis, 2020); however, none of these works goes all the way to quantifying the associated risk premium.\n\nFinally, the financial stability literature has started to put forward the idea of ‘climate stress tests’ on the exposures of financial institutions (see Battiston et al., 2017 and Battiston and Monasterolo, 2018), as well as to develop climate stress-test methodologies for e.g. loan portfolios (see Monasterolo et al., 2018). Central Banks and international institutions, starting with the seminal speech by Carney (2015), have also emphasized on different occasions that climate change could affect systemic risk. In particular, Gros et al. (2016) distinguishes between a benign scenario, with a gradual transition to a low-carbon economy, and an adverse scenario, where the transition occurs more abruptly. In both cases, there could be financial stability consequences: with a too slow transition, the Paris Agreement goal would be missed and the catastrophic consequences of climate change would become unavoidable.5 A too quick transition, on the other hand, would imply a sudden repricing of brown assets. We provide evidence that these concerns are shared by the market.\n\n# 3 Synthetic greenness and transparency indicator\n\nDifferent indicators are available to assess a company’s commitment to the environment. However, identifying synthetic proxies for firms’ environmental performance is not obvious and no consensus has yet been reached in the literature on this issue (see Oikonomou et al., 2012). The main source of information in this respect are firms’ environmental disclosures, which are typically published by companies in their annual reports, or in separate Corporate Social Responsibility or Sustainability reports, as well as in dedicated ESG releases or Corporate Governance reports. Based on these disclosures, investors distinguish companies that are doing green business from firms that are not, or that are not transparent in this respect. However, a single indicator might not be sufficient to ensure a careful assessment of a company’s environmental performance. Hence, we look at both of the following two dimensions: i) environmental transparency, related to the quality of firms’ environmental disclosures, and ii) GHG emissions.\n\nAs a proxy for the environmental transparency of a company we use the Bloomberg Environmental disclosure score, which we refer to as E score.6 This is an index quantifying the completeness of a firm’s disclosure on its impact on the environment. The E score embraces several environmental aspects of a firm’s business. In particular, it looks at how transparent a company is with respect to its carbon emissions, air and water pollution, its commitment to the protection of biodiversity, and its waste management, among others. The weighted E score is normalized to range from zero for companies that do not disclose environmental data to 100 for those which disclose detailed information for each pillar. The score is also tailored for industry sectors, and each component is weighted based on its importance. In particular, GHG emission disclosure is attached the highest weight.\n\n5 The objective of the Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, is to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\n6 MSCI, RobecoSAM, Sustainalytics and Asset4 also provide E disclosure scores based on different methodologies.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nWe use the E score as a measure of the transparency of a firm with respect to its environmental sustainability commitment, and assume that higher commitment is associated with higher transparency. In other words, based on the E score, we make a first selection among firms that are transparent, at least to some extent, about their environmental performance, and firms that are not. We do not claim that firms that do not disclose information on environmental issues are necessarily ecologically destructive. However, we find it legitimate to label them as non-green, as their environmental commitment appears weaker compared to firms that do disclose (quantitative) information on this pillar. Moreover, Marquis et al. (2016) show that more environmentally friendly firms tend to disclose more because they know that their environmental performance is generally better than the one of their peers, while more environmentally damaging firms are indeed less likely to engage in non-mandatory disclosure, in particular in those countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and norms.\n\nTo build a comprehensive index of a company’s environmental performance, we combine this transparency measure with quantitative disclosure on emissions. In particular, we consider the total GHG emission intensity, i.e. the total amount on GHG emissions normalized by revenues. If this is not available, we take the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, weighted by revenues. The synthetic greenness and transparency indicator Gi,y of company i at year y is defined as the weighted average of the two components, as follows:\n\nGi,y = γKi,y + (1 − γ)Ei,y , with γ ∈ [0, 1],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ki,y is\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PERCZYK<|>PERSON<|>Perczyk is a researcher who found that stocks of companies with higher CO2 emission intensity earn higher returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDERSSON<|>PERSON<|>Andersson is a researcher who shows that divestment in higher emission stocks entails a cost for investors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLE<|>PERSON<|>Engle is a researcher mentioned in the context of building climate risk hedging portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOI<|>PERSON<|>Choi is a researcher mentioned in the context of building climate risk hedging portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG<|>PERSON<|>Hong is a researcher mentioned in the context of building climate risk hedging portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALOK<|>PERSON<|>Alok is a researcher mentioned in the context of building climate risk hedging portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTISTON<|>PERSON<|>Battiston is a researcher who has contributed to the financial stability literature regarding climate stress tests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARNEY<|>PERSON<|>Carney is a central banker who emphasized the impact of climate change on systemic risk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROS<|>PERSON<|>Gros is a researcher who distinguishes between different scenarios regarding the transition to a low-carbon economy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aimed at limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOMBERG ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE SCORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bloomberg Environmental Disclosure Score is an index quantifying the completeness of a firm's environmental disclosures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSCI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MSCI is a provider of investment decision support tools, including environmental disclosure scores.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBECO SAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RobecoSAM is an investment firm that provides environmental disclosure scores based on different methodologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINALYTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sustainalytics is a research firm that provides environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and scores.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSET4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asset4 is a provider of ESG data and analytics, including environmental disclosure scores.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERCZYK<|>ANDERSSON<|>Both researchers discuss the financial implications of CO2 emissions and divestment strategies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BATTISTON<|>CARNEY<|>Both researchers contribute to the discussion on climate stress tests and systemic risk in financial institutions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROS<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>Gros's research on economic scenarios relates to the goals of the Paris Agreement<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOMBERG ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE SCORE<|>MSCI<|>Both organizations provide environmental disclosure scores to assess companies' environmental performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOMBERG ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE SCORE<|>ROBECO SAM<|>Both organizations provide environmental disclosure scores to assess companies' environmental performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOMBERG ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE SCORE<|>SUSTAINALYTICS<|>Both organizations provide environmental disclosure scores to assess companies' environmental performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOMBERG ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE SCORE<|>ASSET4<|>Both organizations provide environmental disclosure scores to assess companies' environmental performance<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
