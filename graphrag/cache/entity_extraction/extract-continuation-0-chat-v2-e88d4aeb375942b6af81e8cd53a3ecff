In examining the relationship between CEP and CFP a firm’s industry is often examined separately or used as a control variable because it is believed that the media attention, public pressure, and specific regulations are different for firms in industries with high pollution propensity. Our comparison of studies using firms from industries considered to be ‘worst offenders’ to studies incorporating firms from a broader set of industries reveals there is not a significant moderating effect for the pollution intensity of the firm’s industry (Q = 0.56, p = 0.46). Contrary to expectations, studies examining a broad set of firms found no significant differences between CEP and CFP (r = 0.07) as opposed to studies investigating only those firms from industries that are worst offenders (r = 0.05).\n\n# Methodological Issues\n\nAs previously discussed, the methodology used in CEP–CFP studies has employed a variety of operationalizations of environmental performance and financial performance of firms. Meta-analyzing studies to determine whether different means of measuring environmental performance and firm performance renders valuable results. We performed a meta-analysis with the profitability, market-based, firm growth, cost-efficiency, and other outcomes, with each of the 202 samples being in one category. We report the results in Table 1. Our results indicate that the categories are statistically different from one another (Q = 14.90, p < 0.01) and statistically significant individually with each reflecting a positive CEP–CFP relationship. Overall, a review of the corrected effect sizes for the categories of financial outcomes measures indicates that CEP appears to influence market-based financial performance measures to a greater extent than other indicators (Table 2).\n\nWe further examine the moderating effect of methodological issues by examining the different measurements of environmental performance. We meta-analyze the subgroup of emissions measurements, such as toxic release, versus other environmental performance measurements (e.g., inclusion in independent environmental index). Contrary to expectations, results reveal the difference in operationalizing environmental performance does not significantly influence the CEP–CFP relationship (Q = 0.42, p = 0.52). In an attempt to clarify issues of causality, we examined studies in which environmental and financial performance (DV) were measured at the same point in time to those that utilized a minimum of a 1-year lagged dependent variable (i.e., financial performance measure). Contrary to expectations, we found no significant difference in outcomes regardless of whether the dependent variable was lagged or was measured simultaneously (Q = 0.00, p = 0.99).\n\nResearchers have long criticized the use of self-report measures of environmental performance as having a bias.\n\n# Table 2 Summary of Findings\n\n|CEP–CFP question|Results|\n|---|---|\n|Overall|Does it pay to be green?
