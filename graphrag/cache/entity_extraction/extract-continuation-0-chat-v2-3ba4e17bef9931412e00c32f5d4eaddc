The next section reviews the related previous literature. Section 3 includes the research methodology. Section 4 provides empirical results of the study. The last part highlights the concluding remarks and indicates future research directions.\n\n# 2. Prior Literature\n\nBased on the existing literature on the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures, the study considers a total of 12 independent variables for the meta-analysis as follows:\n\n# Independent Variables\n\n# Corporate Governance:\n\n1. 2.1 Board Independence\n2. 2.2 Board Size\n3. 2.3 Board Gender Diversity\n4. 2.4 Frequency of Board Meetings\n5. 2.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors\n6. 2.6 CEO Duality\n7. 2.7 Auditors’ Credibility\n8. 2.8 Diversity of Ownership\n\n# Dependent Variable\n\nCorporate Social Disclosures\n\n# 2.1 Board Independence\n\nBoard independence indicates the percentage of independent directors on the board. Agency theory suggests that independent directors pay more attention to the interests of the shareholders at the time of board decision-making process (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Independent directors play a decisive role to dominate over the actions of the board of directors on corporate social responsibility matters (Abdullah et al., 2011). Therefore, independent directors ensure the efficient management of the companies as well as protect the interests of the shareholders (De Andres et al., 2005).\n\nSome empirical examinations investigated the link between the board independence and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Dunn and Sainty, 2009, Ibrahim and Hanefah, 2016, Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Lim et al., 2008, Majeed et al., 2015, Kiliç et al., 2015, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Deschênes et al., 2015, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013). Prior literature finds mixed results. For example, Rashid and Lodh (2008), Dunn and Sainty (2009), Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016), Javaid Lone et al. (2016), Rashid and Lodh (2008), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Supriyono et al. (2015) find a significant positive relation between the board independence and CSD. In contrary, the studies of Razak and Mustapha (2013), Lim et al. (2008), and Nurhayati et al. (2016) show the insignificant positive relation between the board independence and CSD. In addition, some studies find an insignificant negative association between the board independence and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Majeed et al., 2015, Kiliç et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Barakat et al., 2015).\n\n# 2.2 Board Size\n\nBoard size refers to the total number of directors on the company’s board. It considers as an effective monitoring tool of corporate governances (Lee and Chen, 2011). The inter-correlation between board size and reporting is complementary. The larger board size of a company tends to disclose more reporting activities (Samaha et al., 2012). However, a larger board is more efficient than the smaller ones but too larger board is ineffective for monitoring the business operations (Giannarakis, 2014a). It is expected that size of the board shows the management ability and reduce the information lopsidedness of the managers and stakeholders (Chen and Jaggi, 2001, Akhtaruddin et al., 2009). Akhtaruddin et al. (2009) also argue that the greater size of Directors indicates a diversification of expertise on the board because of their collective experience and therefore the disclosures quantity and quality will be higher. The existing literature provides a controversial association between board size and CSD. For example, some academicians find a significant positive relationship between board size and CSD (Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Majeed et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2013, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar, 2010, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Barakat et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2014b). In contrast, the studies of Razak and Mustapha (2013), Kiliç et al. (2015), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Ling and Sultana (2015) show insignificant and positive impacts of board size on CSD. In addition, Dunn and Sainty (2009), Sufian and Zahan (2013), and Giannarakis (2013) find an insignificant negative relationship.\n\n# 2.3 Board Gender Diversity\n\nIt indicates the percentage of women directors on the board. The presence of female directors besides male directors on the board plays a vital role to increase the reputation of the company by engaging with social issues (Bear et al., 2010). Prior literature suggests that women are more sensitive to the society (Burgess and Tharenou, 2002). As a result, they increase board\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate governance refers to the systems and processes by which companies are directed and controlled, focusing on the relationships among the management, board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SOCIAL DISCLOSURES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate social disclosures are reports and communications that provide information about a company's social and environmental impact, governance practices, and ethical considerations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>D.SUNDARASEN<|>PERSON<|>D.
