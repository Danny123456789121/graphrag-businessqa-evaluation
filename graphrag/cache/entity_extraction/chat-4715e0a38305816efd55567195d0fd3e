In response to ChatGPT, Google on 7 February 2023 introduced Bard [25]. Google’s newly launched web app, Bard, is expected to be integrated with the company’s other products, including Google Maps and Gmail. The emergence of large language models such as Bard and ChatGPT highlights the evolution of AI from being innocuous to invasive. However, they also pave the way for more productive and creative applications of AI. GAI, for instance, has already begun to shape our entertainment preferences. Streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix use this technology to suggest content based on our past viewing habits [26]. Although users may not be aware of it, GAI is gradually becoming a significant part of our digital experience. The Matrix movie predicted that humans would eventually live in a bubble wherein they feel normal, but machines are feeding their minds. In the future, we will live in a world wherein our existence is cyborg, and we will stop being obsessed with the Bard.\n\nThe field of AI has been a hot topic for decades. In recent years, the concept of GAI has gained widespread attention. This technology allows systems to create new content without specific training, such as music, images, and text. Large language models known as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are used in this type of project. “Generative” refers to a system that can create a new text based on the input it receives, while “pre-\n\nTechnologies 2023, 11, 44\n\n“trained” is a system trained on a large amount of text data. “Transformers” can produce output text using a transformer-based framework. Despite the layoffs of tech workers, the interest in GAI remains high. In 2022, about USD 49 billion was invested in AI, 40% higher than the previous year. Despite the tech downturn, AI companies are still attracting much attention from investors. Developing a GAI model is a complex task that only a handful of prominent tech companies have attempted [27]. OpenAI is a leading company that has developed several cutting-edge AI models, including DALL-E, ChatGPT, and GPT. Google’s parent company also owns DeepMind, which is known for its deep learning software. Meanwhile, Meta has entered the field of GAI with its recent product release.\n\n# 3. GAI and Customers\n\nThe rise of GAI will significantly affect how we consume and create content. It will allow artists and musicians to create new works that are both unique and inspiring. This technology will enable them to analyze large amounts of content and develop new work. With GAI, we will be able to interact with technology in a more personalized manner. Through this technology, teachers can provide their students with the necessary assistance and guidance to reach their goals. The potential of GAI to transform the healthcare industry is immense. Through its systems, which can analyze vast amounts of medical data, researchers and doctors can gain new insights into treating diseases and developing new medical devices. In addition, GAI can also significantly affect the way we conduct our lives. For instance, it will be able to provide us with helpful recommendations on various activities and travel plans. It will also analyze our home data and provide suggestions for improving our lives.\n\nEnterprises can improve their customer service skills through GAI by participating in simulated interactions in a safe and controlled environment. With GAI, learners can improve their language skills in the manufacturing, hospitality, education, and digital marketing industries and communicate more effectively with others. It can also provide them with customized learning experiences to meet their interests and needs. In addition, it can be integrated with a virtual reality platform to provide users with an interactive and immersive experience in different industries. GAI has various selling points. Its standout features include personalized service offerings for guests and cultural sensitivity, providing greater flexibility to cater to diverse customer needs.\n\nThe education industry has been significantly impacted by the rise of digital technologies, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many students shifting to online learning. GAI has the potential to revolutionize the way students learn by analyzing data collected from them to create customized learning plans that cater to their individual needs and help improve their skills. Additionally, virtual tutoring environments can be created with the help of GAI that allow students to interact with real-time teachers and receive feedback and support, which is particularly beneficial for those who lack access to in-person support. However, despite the potential of this technology, it also has some potential drawbacks that need to be addressed.\n\nThe hotel industry is constantly seeking new ways to improve its marketing efforts and reach a wider audience. With the help of AI, hotels can now create engaging and personalized content that enhances the guest experience, including customized room descriptions and recommendations. The use of GAI in hotel marketing has the potential to significantly boost guest engagement and loyalty. As technology continues to evolve, more hotels are expected to adopt this type of software to create personalized content for their customers. The use of GAI in the hotel marketing industry is poised to grow in the coming years and help hotels increase guest engagement while reaching a wider audience.\n\nA decade from now, travelers will have a new level of convenience and personalization thanks to AI-powered travel. With the help of GAI, booking a flight and planning an unforgettable travel experience will be easier than ever before. Online travel agencies such as Expedia, Booking, and Hopper are already seeing an uptick in profits due to the increasing number of people using their platforms to book services such as flights and\n\nincreasing number of people using their platforms to book services such as flights and car rentals. AI-powered tools have the potential to take travel planning to the next level by offering personalized recommendations on accommodations and activities based on individual preferences. These platforms allow users to create customized travel plans tailored to their unique needs and receive recommendations accordingly.\n\nGAI has the potential to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
