To put our estimate of a 7.92 percent loss due to climate change in the perspective of previous estimates, consider that: the literature has considered mainly the specific present value costs of permanent losses in GDP due to abrupt climate change in future years, and, more recently, the costs of losses in GDP related to extreme weather resulting from climate changes. The estimated cost of climate change based on these mechanisms varies from around 0.2% to 1.0% (Stern, 2007) to 2.0% to 3.5% per 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature (Choinière and Horowitz, 2006) and a maximum of 3.75% (Heal and Kriström, 2002). However, the uncertainty about temperature fluctuations adds substantially to the overall costs and shows up in the higher cost of equity capital which previous studies have ignored in this context. Our result amounts to adding an additional present value cost of climate change of larger magnitude to previously identified costs.\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# References\n\nAretz, K., Bartram, S.M., Pope, P.F., 2010.
