As a consequence, significant statistical relationships were found which allowed inferring a positive effect of CP on CFP. We encourage future research to construct their methodological design according to the intended findings and to employ time-lagged variables when investigating causal relationships. This would allow theoretical arguments to be founded on a more solid ground and future meta-analyses studies to draw on even more extensive samples and conduct more detailed analyses. Particularly, future research should thrive to close gaps of knowledge that could not be thoroughly investigated in this study for a lack of data. Specific attention should be paid to the following aspects.\n\nFirst of all, relative donations as a possible indicator of CP were often measured in relation to pre-tax-earnings, sales, or some other accounting variable. However, donations in comparison to industry standards or competitors as well as donation growth should be established as alternative CP measures to eliminate cross-lagged effects between CP and CFP. Although some studies controlled for industry effects and past CFP within their sample, this should be the standard for all studies investigating the CP–CFP relationship. Similarly, including donation growth as a CP indicator, on which almost no data was found within our sample, should become a common practice. Moreover, motivated by the considerable number of studies which did not indicate if they included in-kind donations in their measurement, and the almost non-existence of studies which have addressed the CFP impacts of employee volunteering, it is recommended that more attention is addressed to these issues in future research.\n\nThe most important issue which could not be extensively addressed by our meta-analysis is a possible inverted u-shape relationship between CP and subsequent CFP, implying that there is an optimal level of donations (Wang et al. 2008; Chen and Lin 2015). In this context, theories which propose positive and negative relationships between CP and subsequent CFP might coexist with one effect influencing the other. Unfortunately, there were not enough observations to conduct any meta-analytical analysis to evaluate this u-shape theory. However, this might be an interesting and important direction of further empirical investigation.\n\nFurthermore, our study design did not allow for the discernment of different kinds of direct, indirect, and cross-lagged effects between CP and CFP. As a consequence, although sample subgroups were used to test for the relationship in different contexts and a starting point for more detailed analyses was established, the theoretical lines of argumentation remain very presumptive. To go beyond establishing if a causal relationship exists and explore more soundly how this causal effect is achieved, further investigation of moderating and mediating variables is necessary. Numerous studies have already investigated the impact of CP on corporate reputation, on consumer perception, and on employee motivation. Integrating and advancing research on these mediators could excellently complement and expand the findings which were made by our meta-analysis.\n\nFinally, the integration of ideas from management control system literature into this field of study could provide a fruitful ground for rich discussions on the mechanisms of how and under which circumstances CP might have an effect on CFP and company success. While CP activities can generally be seen to represent company belief and value systems, which attract and motivate employees, boundary systems\n\nF. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nmight be necessary to restrict managerial opportunism from leading to agency costs (Simons 1994). Moreover, as stakeholders’ interests represent an increasingly important part of a company’s goal dimensions, it seems to be a reasonable step to include social activities, such as CP, in diagnostic and interactive management control systems which are used to steer financial and non-financial outcomes and might help to align both interests (Chenhall 2003). This becomes all the more relevant for companies where CP, leading to community welfare, is not only a strategic instrument for shared value creation but a desired outcome of their business activities (Godfrey 2005).\n\n# 6 Conclusion\n\nAt the beginning of this study, we raised the question of whether CP was a form of CSR that could indeed yield economic benefits for companies. Our meta-analysis results found that, in addition to a general positive relationship between CP and CFP, there exists a statistically significant relationship between CP and subsequent CFP, which allows for the implication of a causal relationship. This finding suggests a stronger implementation of CP into management control systems to steer and understand the positive influence of CP on CFP.\n\nThis relationship remained significantly positive throughout a variety of subgroup analyses. Nevertheless, integration of effect sizes in a number of subgroups also showed insignificant relationships between CP and subsequent CFP. Consequently, future research should pay careful attention to their study design when comparing and interpreting findings. Especially time-lagged measurements should be implemented when seeking to investigate causality. Furthermore, control variables should be included to negate any doubts about the validity of results.\n\nBy finding a positive effect of CP on CFP, but pointing out how different conditions might affect this relationship, this study provides a starting point for investigating how and under which circumstances CP can positively influence CFP. In this context, the possible existence of an inverted u-shaped relationship, closer examinations of mediating variables, and integrating perspectives from management control literature are suggested as promising new avenues for extending our understanding of this relationship. Finally, our study has shown that the positive impact of CP on CFP clearly dominates possible negative effects across a wide range of study designs and sample contexts. As a consequence, the notion that CP only inflicts costs needs to be finally left behind as it might mistakenly direct decision-makers to abandon their CP activities. It is important to make clear that CP can make an important contribution to both society’s well-being and a corporation’s economic success.\n\n# Compliance with ethical standards\n\nConflict of interest: The authors declare that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F.
