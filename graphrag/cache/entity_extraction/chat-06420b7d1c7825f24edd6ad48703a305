Moreover, the data—both inherent and firm-specific—underlying these technologies is insufficient to create GAI capability. “Organizations require a unique blend of physical, human, and organizational resources to create an [G]AI capability, which can deliver value by differentiating it from that of competitors” (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021, p. 1). Thus, beyond adopting the GAI applications highlighted in the previous section, HT firms must make long-term and strategic investments into GAI as an organizational capacity that fundamentally transforms how the firm is structured and how it operates. Berg and colleagues (2023) make a similar argument when they state that for organizations to capture value from GAI, they must develop specific complementary assets that are different from those required for other forms of (discriminative) AI capabilities. Another way that HT firms could leverage a GAI capability to boost value creation is to use it to enhance other existing resources and capabilities. For example, by optimizing its supply chain via GAI, a hotel firm like Motel 6 may be able to further build on its core value proposition (of low prices) by offering even lower prices based on lower costs of inventory.\n\n# Organizational Culture Considerations\n\nVarious studies have identified that an organization’s culture plays an important role in its adoption and use of AI (Behl et al., 2022; Dabbous et al., 2022) and, by extension, the development of its AI capability and organizational performance (Bley et al., 2022). According to Mikalef and Gupta (2021), “to unleash the value of [G]AI technologies, organizations must foster a culture of teamwork, collective goals, and shared resources” (p. 6). Individuals and teams across functional silos within HT firms must have a shared vision and foster a culture of open communication and collaboration, particularly as it pertains to the sharing of data that feeds GAI models. Thus, an organizational culture that cultivates a “sharing knowledge is power” environment versus a “knowledge is power” climate can more effectively leverage the knowledge management and deployment capabilities of the firm (Korzynski et al., 2023; Liebowitz, 2001), which, in turn, contribute to GAI capabilities. Relatedly, HT firms must look to build cross-functional teams that include data scientists, software developers, and subject matter experts from various departments to collaborate on AI projects and applications that co-create value for their stakeholders. This also necessitates a culture that embraces risk and places a premium on creativity and taking bold and radical actions (Berg et al., 2023), while placing an ethic of hospitality—and its associated value constellation of care, honesty, integrity, dignity, and respect for and towards its various stakeholders—as its guiding organizational principle (Mody, 2023). Thus, as offered by Mikalef and Gupta (2021), “developing an [G]AI orientation within the firm is a necessary precondition for successful deployments” (p. 14).\n\n# Legal Considerations\n\nWhile the increased use of personal information can lead to improved customer service recommendations and overall customer experience, it also leads to more regulation about the collection, storage, processing, and sharing of this information. GAI systems rely on vast amounts of data to function effectively. In the HT industry, this data often includes sensitive information such as personal details. For instance, chatbots handle travel plans, potentially including credit card information. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is crucial to ensuring compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws (Kuner, 2018). Consequently, HT organizations may find it difficult to comply with the increased regulation in data protection and privacy laws across borders. Some countries have more comprehensive data protection laws that restrict the use of AI and automated decision-making involving personal information. Other countries do not have a single comprehensive law regulating privacy and automated decision-making. The United States, for example, has a myriad of state laws that cover some aspects of data protection and privacy. The European Union (EU), on the other hand, has been much more proactive in creating consumer protection and privacy legislation, with the most comprehensive to date being the GDPR enacted in 2018.\n\nIn addition to legislation surrounding the protection of customer information held and used by companies, there are other GAI-specific regulations that are being drafted in the EU, China, and the United States. These regulations would require that companies developing GAI tools (such as the OpenAI platform that developed ChatGPT) meet strict requirements for the data used to train their algorithms (i.e., the input for GAI tools), including disclosing the use of copyrighted material. In this regard, the EU is mulling a tiered approach to regulating GAI, whereby, in addition to the makers of GAI models, one of the layers of regulation would be focused on “regulating relationships in the AI value chain.” Thus, it is likely that the users of GAI models,\n\n# Dogru et al. - Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\n\nincluding HT organizations, may be required to have specific obligations to downstream stakeholders (customers, employees, etc.), including the need to explain how the model was trained, the use of copyrighted material, and the accuracy of the datasets from biases (Lomas, 2023). It would be legally incumbent upon HT organizations to ensure that the stakeholder data that serves as an additional input into the GAI models produces output that creates and does not destroy value. For example, if creating personalized marketing communications at scale, firms will need to ensure that the GAI model\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
