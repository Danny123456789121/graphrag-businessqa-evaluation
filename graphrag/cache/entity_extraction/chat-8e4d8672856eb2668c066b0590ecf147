However, it remains unclear under which conditions and to what extent philanthropic activities are associated with corporate financial performance (CFP). This study sets out to shed light on the relationship between CP and CFP by means of a meta-analysis. A total of 183 effect sizes from 45 empirical studies are statistically integrated and analyzed within several subgroups. Particular attention is paid to time-lagged variable measurements that allow interpretation for causality. The general relationship between CP and CFP is found to be significantly positive. Furthermore, results reveal that CP is positively related to subsequent CFP across a wide range of different study designs, including different operationalizations of CFP and CP, different sample criteria, and the control for moderating variables. This paper goes beyond the question of if CP affects CFP and provides a status quo for a more detailed discussion on how and when CP influences CFP. Consequently, integrating research on mediating variables and adding perspectives of management control literature to the CP research field are suggested as promising avenues for future research.\n\n# Keywords\n\nCorporate philanthropy · Corporate financial performance · Corporate giving · Corporate social responsibility · Corporate social performance · Meta-analysis\n\n# Contact Information\n\nEdeltraud Guenther\n\nema@mailbox.tu-dresden.de\n\nFrederik Plewnia\n\nfrederik.plewnia@tu-dresden.de\n\n# Affiliation\n\n1 Faculty of Business and Economics, Chair of Environmental Management and Accounting, Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden, Germany\n\nPublished online: 18 September 2017\n\n# F. Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\n# JEL Classification\n\nM14 · M40\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nAgainst the argument of Friedman (1970) that the only social responsibility of a corporation is to generate profit, the contemporary understanding is that companies are closely intertwined with and dependent on the society around them (Porter and Kramer 2002) and should be controlled accordingly. Consumers, employees, and other stakeholders expect business organizations to meet legal requirements and minimize damage inflicted on society and, moreover, they want them to actively engage in solving societal problems (Carroll 1991) and expect management attention to be directed towards these objectives.\n\nThe associated general concept of business interacting with society is referred to as corporate social responsibility (CSR; Dahlsrud 2008), whereas the combination of CSR principles, processes, and outcomes is defined as corporate social performance (CSP; Wood 1991). Corporate philanthropy (CP), understood as the voluntary donation of firm resources to society, forms an important part of this concept and is often used as a proxy when financial outcomes of CSR activities are evaluated (Wang et al. 2015). However, CSP is a multidimensional construct, including aspects such as fair employee treatment, legal compliance, environmental performance, or community involvement (Rowley and Berman 2000). Each of these specific dimensions has its own characteristics and their outcomes need to be controlled (Chenhall 2003) and evaluated separately (Wang et al. 2016).\n\nParticularly for CP, where doing ‘good’ for society is not directly associated with the main business purpose of a company (Kourula and Halme 2008), there is an ongoing discussion as to whether corporate donations only inflict costs on a company or if they may also lead to financial benefits (Liket and Simaens 2015; Gautier and Pache 2015).\n\nMuch research has focused on the question of whether philanthropic activities, besides being socially desirable, can be associated with economic success of companies and has empirically investigated the relationship between CP and corporate financial performance (CFP). Various studies have used stakeholder theory to argue that CP would indirectly be connected with financial benefits because it can improve the reputation of a company, foster customer relations, and increase employee motivation, thereby enhancing the firm’s overall business performance (Seifert et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2008; Lim 2010; Muller and Kraussl 2011a). While some empirical results supported these arguments (Tian 2012; Qiu 2013; Iatridis 2015), others did not (Seifert et al. 2003, 2004). Again others found a negative relationship (Balabanis et al. 1998; Gao et al. 2012), supporting arguments of agency theory that CP is used by managers for their personal benefit and has a negative relationship with a firm’s financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2005).\n\nAlthough past meta-analyses have distinguished CP as a specific dimension of CSP (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Allouche and Laroche 2005; Margolis et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2015), these studies did not pay particular attention to different study designs, which would have allowed for causal interpretation within the CP subsample, and were unable to resolve confusion surrounding contradictory results.\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\nIn consequence, recently conducted literature reviews (Liket and Simaens 2015; Gautier and Pache 2015) came to the conclusion that the question of whether CP leads to higher CFP has not yet been answered. Gautier and Pache (2015) found that “many variations appear across firms, industries, and periods, as robust and widespread conclusions remain to be drawn” (G\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
