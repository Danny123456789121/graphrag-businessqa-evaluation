Overall, this empirical evidence conÖrms the presence of a carbon premium in the UK that lasted for as long as it did in Germany.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# 10 Discussion and Conclusions\n\nThe EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for regulating carbon emissions. At the center of this scheme is the creation of a new market for trading carbon emission allowances. From 2013 onwards, these allowances are auctioned off at a price thus generating significant revenues for EU governments. From 2005 to 2012, however, during the initial two phases of the ETS, allowances were granted to carbon emitting firms for free. As a result, firms receiving these allowances could either sell them for profit or they could use them for production thus making these allowances an opportunity cost to be accounted for in setting prices and quantities.\n\nThe free allocation of carbon allowances in the initial two phases of the ETS is a crucial aspect of the scheme. Previous theoretical work suggests that the free allocation overcompensates firms and can lead to large increases in profits. The mechanism that leads to substantial additional profits for carbon emitting firms has two direct channels: (i) firms face higher marginal costs, which to a large extent are passed through to consumers through higher output prices, thus increasing firm revenue; and (ii) output falls and, since carbon allowances are allocated freely, the allowances not used in production can be sold for a profit. In a separate argument, carbon emitting firms are exposed to higher risk and hence require higher expected returns due to uncertainty about the future price of carbon allowances, which also generates uncertainty about future cash flows.\n\nThis paper fills a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical evaluation of whether firms that received carbon emission allowances significantly outperformed firms that did not. In particular, we examine the effect of the EU ETS on stock returns. We do so by assessing the size, significance and timing of the carbon premium, which is defined as the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of dirty firms over and above the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of clean firms in the context of standard asset pricing models. Our analysis focuses on Germany, which is the largest market affected by the ETS, but for robustness we also examine data from the UK.\n\nOur main finding is that there is a large and statistically significant carbon premium in stock returns. The carbon premium can be as high as 17% and highly significant for the sample period that begins in November 2003 and ends in March 2009. This sample period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the EU ETS and ends with the passing of another EU law establishing Phase III of the EU ETS beginning in\n\n22\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n2013 during which carbon allowances are mainly sold in auctions. Hence this is the period over which the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting Örms will be receiving free carbon allowances. Our evidence clearly indicates that after March 2009 the carbon premium dissipates. Furthermore, the timing of the carbon premium based on German data is conÖrmed when using UK data.\n\nOur cross-sectional analysis indicates that for the relevant sample period, we can con- struct a carbon risk factor based on the returns of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio, which can explain a considerable part of the cross-sectional variation in expected stock returns. For this sample period, the signiÖcance of the carbon risk factor is robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables. This suggests that Örms with high carbon emissions have higher exposure to carbon risk and exhibit higher expected returns.\n\nAs a Önal note, the evidence suggests that a carbon premium is present for a speciÖc period that commences about one year before the beginning of Phase I and disappears about one year into Phase II. It is possible, therefore, that the carbon premium may have been a one-o§ event, which was only present during this particular period. Indeed, this is likely as the carbon premium is primarily driven by the free allocation of carbon allowances. Still, our analysis contributes to the current environmental policy debate because it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade en- vironmental regulation implemented elsewhere.\n\n23\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\n# References\n\nAmihud, Y.
