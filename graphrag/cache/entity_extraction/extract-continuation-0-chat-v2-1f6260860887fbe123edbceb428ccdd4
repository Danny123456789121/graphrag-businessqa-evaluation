Carbon offset refers to a monetary investment that abates greenhouse gas emission or sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, which is used to compensate for greenhouse gas emission from companies’ own activities. To combat severe air pollution, Beijing, for example, has had “APEC-blue” sky, because the government temporarily shut down the industrial area in Hebei. The overall mean value for environmental indicators is 4.20 (out of 5).

The t-test for “economic performance” shows no significant result. Interestingly, the mean values for all four indicators are below the test value of 4, suggesting that all economic indicators were not perceived to be as important as they were intended to be in the GRI guidelines.
