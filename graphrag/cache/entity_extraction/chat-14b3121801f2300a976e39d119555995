First, the number of CEP–CFP studies included in these analyses is far from exhaustive. That applies in particular to the inﬂuential study of Orlitzky et al. (2003), which included at the most only 17 CEP–CFP studies. Furthermore, their analysis only included studies published until 1997. Given that knowledge about social phenomena, in general, tends to be historically dependent (Combs et al., 2011; Gergen, 1976), and that environmental issues in particular have gained increasing importance during the last years, it is likely that study ﬁndings vary over time and that more recent studies that have not been included yielded different results. Second, despite the lack of a commonly shared deﬁnition or conceptualization of CEP (e.g., Etzion, 2007; Walls, Phan, & Berrone, 2011; Xie & Hayase, 2007), it is beyond question that CEP is a multidimensional construct (e.g., Clemens & Bakstran, 2010; Dooley & Fryxell, 1999; First & Khetriwal, 2010; Trumpp, Endrikat, Zopf, & Guenther, in press), which has been measured in several different ways. However, none of the CSP–CFP meta-analyses decomposed the CEP construct into more speciﬁc dimensions and thus failed to account for the multidimensional nature of CEP and possible moderation effects concerning this matter. Third, in all CSP–CFP meta-analyses the moderator analyses as well as analyses with regard to the direction of causality have been conducted only at the level of the overall analysis pertaining to CSP. As CEP constitutes one dimension of the broader (meta-) construct of CSP (Orlitzky et al., 2003), there are undoubtedly similarities regarding theoretical reasoning and empirical manifestations. However, methodological literature on multidimensional constructs urgently cautions that confounding construct level (in this case CSP) and dimension level (in this case CEP) would imply serious threats to validity (e.g., Law, Wong, & Mobley, 1998; Wong, Law, & Huang, 2008). Indeed, notwithstanding the similarities, there are also fundamental differences that may warrant a separate treatment of CEP and CSP (Bansal & Gao, 2006). Walls, Berrone, and Phan (2012, p. 892), for example, argued that environmental issues tend to differ from social issues because ‘‘they are technical, require speciﬁc ﬁrm capabilities and signiﬁcant capital investment, are guided by regulation, and have their own reporting criteria’’. Also empirical examinations have shown that CEP should be considered a distinct part of the overarching construct of CSP and that certain levels of CSP do not necessarily correspond to sim\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al.

Some scholars even questioned the general suitability of CSP as a meaningful construct (e.g., Marom, 2006; Peloza, 2009; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Schreck, 2011). Rowley and Berman (2000, p. 405) asserted that the CSP construct is “fatally flawed” due to aggregation of seemingly unrelated aspects, or in their words “mishmashes of uncorrelated variables”. Without taking a stand on this debate, we argue, at the very least, that empirical findings and conclusions regarding CSP cannot be readily transferred to CEP. Hence, apart from the finding that the relationship between CEP and CFP tends to be positive, at least for the (limited) number of studies examined in previous CSP–CFP meta-analyses, we cannot draw any inferences from these works pertaining to the CEP–CFP link, neither with regard to moderation effects, nor regarding the question of causality.\n\nTwo recently published meta-analyses sought to address this apparent gap in the literature. By conducting a meta-analysis of CEP–CFP studies, Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, and Romi (2013) found a positive, though weak, overall relationship. Moreover, they examined a set of contingent variables such as different firm characteristics (e.g., large vs. small firms) or methodological issues (e.g., archival measures vs. self-reported data). Despite the importance of the analysis provided by Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013), their study has three major limitations. First, the sample of studies on which Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) based their examination is far from comprehensively encompassing the available empirical evidence, which is somewhat contradictory to the idea of systematic research syntheses (Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
