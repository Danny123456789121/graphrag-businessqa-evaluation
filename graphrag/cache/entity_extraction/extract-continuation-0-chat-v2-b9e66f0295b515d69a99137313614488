Regarding this type of studies our findings revealed positive relationships for all subgroups. Furthermore, both process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP are more strongly related to concurrent accounting-based CFP than to concurrent market-based CFP. As noted earlier, studies that measure CEP and CFP contemporaneously strictly speaking do not allow establishing causal inferences. However, we argue that there may be certain circumstances under which it might be conceivable that CEP and CFP are related to each other in a concurrent manner. First, both CEP and CFP may be possible expressions of superior management quality. Several scholars suggested that the boundaries between CEP and good management practices are fluent and that CEP just reflects managerial excellence (e.g., Bowman & Haire, 1975; Waddock & Graves, 1997; Wagner & Blom, 2011). Along this line, both CEP and CFP may constitute the results of effective management and thus may represent two sides of the same coin. Accordingly, the quality of management would constitute a confounding variable in the CEP-CFP relationship. Unfortunately, empirical studies face the problem that good management is hardly measurable, if possible at all (Telle, 2006).\n\nSecond, it should be noted that concurrent measurement of both constructs in this context is not necessarily equivalent to absolute simultaneity. Usually, studies use data referring to a particular fiscal year. Hence, concurrent measurement in this context may involve a time span of one year. Therefore, certain environmental initiatives such as the conservation of energy or the reduction of costly hazardous materials may entail cost savings and immediate financial benefits that affect accounting-based CFP in the current period. For example, a recent study of McKinsey and Company suggested that the US economy bears a $1.2 trillion energy reduction potential (Granade et al., 2009). That means that even nowadays, a great number of low hanging fruits (Hart & Ahuja, 1996) are waiting to be reaped. One might argue that suggesting that managers would overlook such profitable opportunities is somewhat implausible and simpleminded. However, King and Lenox (2002) pointed out that managers may underexploit opportunities for profitable emission reductions due to search costs, prior expectations, or lacking complementary resources and capabilities for exploring “the locus of profitable pollution reduction” (King & Lenox, 2002).\n\nThird, regarding market-based CFP, concurrent measurement may not undermine causal interpretation as market-based measures reflect investors’ expectations of future returns and thus should index CEP effects even in concurrent measurement. Several scholars argued that market-based measures are more appropriate than accounting-based measures for capturing the financial benefits of CEP (e.g., Davidson & Worrell, 1990; Delmas & Nairn-Birch, 2011; Hillman & Keim, 2001). Our analysis to some extent questions these theoretical sound propositions as we found stronger relationships for accounting-based measures, unambiguously at least for studies measuring both constructs concurrently. However, this finding is in line with the CSP–CFP meta-analysis of Orlitzky et al. (2003). One possible interpretation is that the relationship between CEP and CFP may be driven primarily by internal effects (e.g., increased production efficiency) rather than by external effects (e.g., reputation effects). First, this is indicated by the finding of a stronger relationship between CEP and CFP for accounting-based measures, which may be better indicators of internal efficiency than market-based measures (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Van Beurden & Gössling, 2008). Second, also our finding that outcome-based CEP, implying a more internal focus than process-based CEP, tends to show a stronger relationship with CEP points in that direction.\n\nFurthermore, our findings showed that the strategic approach underlying a firms’ dealing with environmental issues significantly determines the relationship between CEP and CFP. We confirmed the widely expressed argument that proactive approaches to CEP are more likely to be associated with superior financial performance than reactive approaches (e.g., King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Hence, our findings suggest that the redesign of production processes and the focus on source reduction and process innovation, inherent to proactive approaches (Russo & Fouts, 1997), induce greater financial benefits than a compliance mode.\n\nOur partial HOMA results provided additional evidence for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP in general, because even when the influence of other variables was partialled out the relationship remained positive and significant. Moreover, our partial HOMA indicated the existence of moderation effects of several methodological artifacts. In order to examine whether other variables are involved in the focal relationship, we examined the influence of control variables applied in the primary studies. Surprisingly, we only found a significant effect for the financial risk variable while other control variables such as the type of industry, firm size, R&D intensity, advertising intensity, and capital intensity did not appear to affect the relationship. Our finding that studies controlling for firms’ financial risk yield weaker relationships parallels the result of Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001), who found that firms with superior CSP incur less financial risk. Hence, also with regard to the CEP–CFP link risk may play an important role. CEP may well provide some type of insurance effect (Minor & Morgan, 2011; Peloza, 2006) as it may reduce the probability of litigation, increase firm reputation, and may lead to tax benefits, lower costs of equity\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CFP refers to Corporate Financial Performance, a measure of a company's financial health and profitability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CEP stands for Corporate Environmental Performance, which assesses a company's environmental impact and sustainability practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINSEY AND COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinsey and Company is a global management consulting firm that provides insights and strategies for businesses, including studies on energy reduction potential.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING AND LENOX<|>PERSON<|>King and Lenox are scholars who have researched the relationship between corporate environmental performance and financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>PERSON<|>Orlitzky is a scholar known for conducting meta-analyses on corporate social performance and corporate financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSO AND FOUTS<|>PERSON<|>Russo and Fouts are researchers who have studied the impact of proactive environmental strategies on financial performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEP<|>CFP<|>CEP and CFP are related as they both reflect aspects of a company's management quality and performance, with CEP potentially influencing CFP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCKINSEY AND COMPANY<|>CEP<|>McKinsey and Company conducted a study suggesting a significant energy reduction potential, which relates to corporate environmental performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING AND LENOX<|>CEP<|>King and Lenox have researched the relationship between CEP and CFP, indicating that proactive approaches to CEP are linked to better financial performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING AND LENOX<|>CFP<|>King and Lenox's research suggests that CEP can influence CFP, highlighting the connection between environmental initiatives and financial outcomes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLITZKY<|>CFP<|>Orlitzky's meta-analysis indicates a positive relationship between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance, supporting the link between CEP and CFP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSO AND FOUTS<|>CEP<|>Russo and Fouts argue that proactive environmental strategies lead to better financial performance, linking their research to the concept of CEP<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
