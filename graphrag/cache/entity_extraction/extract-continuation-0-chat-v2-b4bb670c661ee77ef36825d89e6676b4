Moreover, extant studies mainly emphasize the legal and ethical issues that might arise from GAI applications. In the present study, we go beyond discussing GAI applications for research and education and the potential legal and ethical impacts resulting from the use of GAI in HT contexts. We present a wide range of GAI applications for the HT industry and propose a conceptual framework that provides a comprehensive account of the GAI impacts on HT stakeholders. This framework integrates the resource-based view of GAI, ethical, financial, legal, (internal) education, (organizational) culture, and technology infrastructure (REFLECT) mechanisms and is based on the perspectives of 30 HT academics and practitioners with expertise in various HT domains. Consistent with the work of Freudenreich and colleagues (2020), the REFLECT model aims “to support theoretical and empirical analyses of value creation [via GAI] as well as the management and transformation of business models in line with corporate sustainability ambitions and stakeholder expectations” (p. 3).\n\n# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism\n\nOur proposed framework indicates that the application of GAI can result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value for a variety of stakeholders, and these effects can be mediated by the HT firm via calibration of the various REFLECT-based mechanisms. The reciprocal nature of the relationship between various HT stakeholders and GAI applications in the proposed integrative framework is portrayed by a feedback loop where the benefits of using GAI to facilitate value co-creation for some HT stakeholders might, in turn, lead to co-destruction of value for other stakeholders due to friction in these relationships. However, value co-destruction can be mitigated while value co-creation is enhanced by effective applications of GAI through the REFLECT factors. Furthermore, this integrative conceptual framework offers opportunities for future theoretical, methodological, and empirical research in the context of the nexus between GAI and HT stakeholders.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\nAlthough GAI is an exciting technological development, ultimately, HT is a people industry and will always involve people serving people. Utilizing GAI technology solutions, which work in tandem with consumers, employees, managers, and other HT stakeholders, is necessary to provide greater capabilities and to co-create value for HT stakeholders. Therefore, HT firms should navigate the applications of GAI through several mediating factors (i.e., REFLECT) to facilitate reciprocal value co-creation and to minimize or eliminate potential value co-destruction.\n\nHT firms should make long-term and strategic investment decisions when implementing GAI applications and leverage their GAI capability to improve other existing resources and capabilities (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). In so doing, HT firms can fundamentally transform their organizational capacity and how they are structured and operated. Furthermore, the insights generated by GAI applications can be used to make strategic sales, staffing, inventory management, supply chain management, and other cost-related decisions to increase overall business efficiency and profitability. Also, GAI should be utilized to generate new products and services, offer creative branding and promotion strategies, and to develop pricing strategies, business models, and design to advance operational activities, competitiveness, and revenues.\n\nHT leaders should shepherd careful integration of GAI in the workplace, considering the perception of employees. Implementation of GAI will likely eliminate some existing jobs and create new ones in the HT industry (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Iskender, 2023). It will also likely change the nature and requirements of other jobs. Accordingly, HT firms need to invest in reskilling and retraining programs to ensure continued employment opportunities in the changing work environment, which necessitates collaboration between humans and GAI. However, not all jobs will be affected or lost due to GAI applications. Therefore, HT firms need to train their respective employees and provide a sense of comfort and ensure job security in this context.\n\nGAI without the monitoring function could create an asymmetric risk for HT industry and might turn HT experiences into value co-destruction events for consumers, employees, firms, and other HT stakeholders. Therefore, HT organizations should explain to all stakeholders—internal and external—how their GAI models are trained, whether and how copyrighted materials are used, which consumer and employee data are fed into the GAI, and the extent to which datasets are accurate and free from biases (Lomas, 2023). Although many aspects of GAI applications in the context of liability and accountability have yet to be determined, HT firms should develop internal policies to protect their guests and other stakeholders from potential ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise due to use of GAI. In so doing, HT firms ensure that GAI models produce output that creates and captures (not destroys) value for HT stakeholders in reciprocal means while providing the necessary security and privacy protections.\n\n# Future Research Directions\n\nAs with any transformative technology, GAI also poses ethical, social, legal, and economic challenges that require careful consideration. Otherwise, premature implementation of GAI might lead to value-destruction for HT stakeholders. Therefore, many research questions remain to be answered to evaluate the efficacy of this technological tool in value creation for HT stakeholders. Accordingly, we postulated 50 research questions, some overarching, and some pertaining to the various components of our framework. The research questions were then rated by the 30 coauthors of this study on a 5-point importance scale ranging from “not at all important” to “extremely important.” Subsequently, each research question was categorized according to its primary focus: overarching, application-based, REFLECT-based, and stakeholder-based questions, and the questions were ranked within their respective category based on their level of importance according to survey results. Table 1 provides an account of these questions as rated by the authors of this research on a 5-point importance scale.\n\nAnswering these questions will shed light on the implications of the GAI for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a technological development that can create and capture value for stakeholders in the Hospitality and Tourism (HT) industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Hospitality and Tourism (HT) industry involves services provided to consumers, including accommodations, food services, and travel-related services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFLECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The REFLECT model is a conceptual framework that integrates various mechanisms to analyze the impacts of GAI on HT stakeholders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREUDENREICH<|>PERSON<|>Freudenreich is an academic whose work is referenced in the context of GAI and its implications for value creation in the HT industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKALEF<|>PERSON<|>Mikalef is an academic referenced in the context of strategic investment decisions related to GAI applications in the HT industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARVALHO<|>PERSON<|>Carvalho is an academic referenced in the context of the impact of GAI on jobs in the HT industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IVANOV<|>PERSON<|>Ivanov is an academic referenced in the context of the impact of GAI on jobs in the HT industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOMAS<|>PERSON<|>Lomas is an academic referenced in the context of ethical, legal, and social issues arising from GAI applications in the HT industry.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAI<|>HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM<|>GAI applications can create and capture value for stakeholders in the Hospitality and Tourism industry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REFLECT<|>GAI<|>The REFLECT model provides a framework for analyzing the impacts of GAI on HT stakeholders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREUDENREICH<|>REFLECT<|>Freudenreich's work supports the theoretical framework of the REFLECT model<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIKALEF<|>GAI<|>Mikalef discusses strategic investment decisions related to GAI applications in the HT industry<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARVALHO<|>GAI<|>Carvalho addresses the impact of GAI on job dynamics in the HT industry<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IVANOV<|>GAI<|>Ivanov discusses the impact of GAI on job dynamics in the HT industry<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOMAS<|>GAI<|>Lomas highlights ethical, legal, and social issues related to GAI applications in the HT industry<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
