The literature brings initial indications on the contribution of strategic organizational capabilities to corporate sustainability. However, these attempts are still incipient and non-structured. Thus, in order to explore different organizational capabilities that companies can develop to obtain sustainability benefits, this paper aims to propose an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits. For this, a systematic literature review was conducted, based on a paper sample of 88 publications extracted from the ISI Web of Science database. The paper also develops a descriptive overview of the subject, presenting the main gaps and a research agenda. The results showed that corporate sustainability is strongly related to business strategy and the ability of companies to develop specific capabilities. Thus, the understanding from academics and managers on what strategic organizational capabilities (OCs) consists and how they can be developed or improved is fundamental to reaching corporate sustainability. The paper presents some contributions. First, the integrative framework developed from the literature review comprises seven categories of organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCSs) related to ten categories of corporate sustainability benefits (CSBs). Second, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization to achieve a certainly expected sustainability benefit. Third, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature and those that need further research. Fourth, the overview of the literature of OCS by bibliometric and cluster analyses allowed a broad understanding of how academics have addressed these themes over the years. Finally, the research agenda developed from the literature review may broaden opportunities for further research on the subject.\n\n# Keywords\n\nOrganizational Capabilities, Corporate Sustainability, Corporate Sustainability Benefits.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe literature has indicated that organizations that take into account the impacts of their actions on the environment and society may achieve economic returns, competitive advantage and better performance (Dangelico et al., 2017; Hofmann et al., 2012; Barnett and Salomon, 2012; Reuter et al., 2010; Orlitzky et al., 2003).\n\nIn this scenario, the logic of corporate sustainability has been gaining prominence among companies and researchers have been studying corporate sustainability from a strategic perspective, considering that organization capabilities (OCs) developed by\n\ncompanies can influence it (Amui et al., 2017; Annunziata et al. 2017; Branco and Rodrigues, 2006). OC can be defined as the ability of an organization to perform tasks to achieve desired results by using its available resource base (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003; Winter, 2003; Zollo and Winter, 2002).\n\nThe first relevant studies on resources and capabilities from a strategic management perspective are found from the Resource Based View (RBV) (Barney, 2001; Wernerfelt, 1984). The RBV focuses on resources and capabilities to explain the superior performance of some companies to reach a competitive advantage.
