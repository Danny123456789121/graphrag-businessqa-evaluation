This implies the construction of a proactive organizational culture, which will determine how sustainability will be thought, acted, and experienced (Baumgartner, 2014), leading top management towards the adequate understanding of which initiatives should be developed, by whom and for what reason (Manning, Braam, & Reimsbach, 2019).\n\nThe will to implement sustainability practices should be clearly expressed in organizational strategies, namely, through the economic perspective of the social and environmental dimensions, the mitigation of negative environmental impacts caused by the organization's activities, and the creation of tangible value and benefits for society in the short, medium, and long term (Aarseth, Ahola, Aaltonen, Ãkland, & Andersen, 2017). To achieve this, the business model should reflect its strategic will to balance the TBL (Stubbs, 2019). All these issues must be assessed through a systematic process that measures the adequacy of the organization's use of resources and of the implemented actions to improve TBL balance (Montiel & Delgado-Ceballos, 2014).\n\nFinally, it is through reporting that organizations disclose their intentions, progresses, results, and future perspectives (Maas, Schaltegger, & Crutzen, 2016). Organizations worldwide are increasingly including in sustainability reports information regarding their contribution to the SDGs (Fonseca & Carvalho, 2019; Poddar et al., 2019; Rosati & Faria, 2019). However, this practice of publicly disclosing information on how an organization is addressing the SDGs is still limited to larger organizations (Rosati & Faria, 2019), to organizations with a higher environmental footprint (Poddar et al., 2019), and to organizations with higher commitment to sustainability frameworks, like the UN Global Compact (Fonseca &\n\n# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA\n\nCarvalho, 2019; Rosati & Faria, 2019). As can be noted, the progress towards sustainability is not simple. It is recognized by specialists that the change from a conventional style to a sustainability approach causes several organizational transformations, some of them having profound implications. These transformations are influenced by diverse barriers, drivers, and internal and external key factors that will determine the success or failure of the organizational transition to a sustainability-oriented pathway (Asswad, Hake, & Marx GÃ³mez, 2016).\n\nPain reinforces this idea by acknowledging that most of the approaches and organizational models were not able to lead to a systemic thinking of integrative actions towards sustainability, due, at least in part, to the inability of organizational thinking to integrate and balance sustainability dimensions (Pain, 2014). Other studies refer the non-existence of a single integration model that allows organizations to implement sustainability practices in their daily activities and in their medium and long-term strategies, using simple and conventional management procedures (Maas et al., 2016; Morioka & de Carvalho, 2016; Rosati & Faria, 2019).\n\nThe study described in this paper was based on a qualitative exploratory research, combining different perspectives found in a structured literature review, and aims to explore a differentiating approach regarding the dynamization and integration of sustainability in organizational context. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to propose methodologies to drive organizations towards the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools in order to materialize their intentions regarding sustainability issues. For this, a framework for sustainability management will be developed, designated as Integrative Sustainable Intelligence (ISI). This framework is expected to provide organizational managers with a structural model that leads to a logical pathway between the development, implementation, assessment, and correction of sustainability-oriented activities.\n\nThe main contributions of this research are the following: (a) the development of the ISI framework; (b) the development of a simple approach, structured in functional steps, which allows managers to question the pathway towards organizational sustainability; (c) the understanding of sustainability through a holistic and transversal approach, which is expected to help organizations in the strategic decision-making process regarding the operationalization of CS.\n\nAlso, the development of the ISI model, presented in this paper, is expected to provide a theoretical contribution to the subject of organizational sustainability management, enhancing future empirical research projects focusing this model's impacts and relevance and thus contributing to its continuous refinement.\n\n# BACKGROUND\n\nThe acknowledgement that the present trends regarding production and consumption are unbearable is patent in several scenarios (Costanza et al., 2014) and has led to the understanding of the importance and irreparability of functions and values that are being lost in the natural and social environments, many of which are critical for the adequate operation and balance of different systems.\n\nSome signs are promising counteracts of the present degradation, namely, planet's decarbonization initiatives (RockstrÃ¶m et al., 2017), the UN agenda for SD (UN, 2015), and the clear pressure that stakeholders are exerting on the activities of organizations (Govindan, 2018).\n\nAll these reasons motivate organizations to dedicate more attention to the mitigation of negative impacts caused by their activities (Michelon, Boesso, & Kumar,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
