Considering the above concerns regarding the use of generative AI and the current lack of discipline, we offer some insights into the future design of regulatory frameworks to guide the use of generative AI.\n\nThe government should consider the current trends in the development of generative AI when designing laws and regulations to prevent unauthorized access. A corresponding improvement in the legal system for using AI techniques is essential not only for the business and finance sectors but also for other institutional users or individuals who may suffer from data breaches (ChatGpt and Demir 2023). To mitigate the risks of these concerns, Open AI introduced the Bug Bounty Program, which aims to improve data security (OpenAI 2023a). Nevertheless, more efforts should be made to establish regulatory frameworks and create technologies to protect privacy and prevent the spread of false or biased information from generative AI. Policymakers should also consider other ways to prepare people for future AI developments, such as how to offset the negative effects of generative AI on employment and inequality. In addition, as the sole license holder of GPT-3, Microsoft has the monopolistic power to control generative AI tools (Dis, Bollen, and Zuidema 2023; Hao 2020). This situation calls for government action to lower the entry barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises and promote healthy competition in an ideal business environment.\n---\n# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES\n\n# 21\n\nPlease list laws and regulations announced by governments around the world to govern the use of generative AI.\n\nGovernments around the world are jostling to take the lead on regulating AI systems. However, there is currently no legislation specifically designed to regulate the use of AI. Rather, AI systems are regulated by other existing regulations such as data protection, consumer protection, and market competition laws. The European Union has unveiled strict regulations to govern the use of artificial intelligence and is finalizing the AI Act, a sweeping regulation that aims to regulate the most \"high-risk\" usages of AI systems in sectors such as health care and education.\n\nIs there a specific country or region you would like more information about?\n\nLearn more\n\n# 1 of 5\n\nTell me more about the EU's AI Act:\n\nThe AI Act is a regulation proposed by the European Commission that aims to introduce a common regulatory and legal framework for artificial intelligence, encompassing all sectors (except for military) and all types of artificial intelligence. The proposed legislation focuses primarily on strengthening rules around data quality, transparency, human oversight, and accountability.\n\nThe AI Act will be the world's first comprehensive AI law and will regulate the use of artificial intelligence in the EU according to the risk they pose to users. The different risk levels will mean more or less regulation. AI systems with an unacceptable level of risk to people's safety would be strictly prohibited, including systems that deploy subliminal or purposefully manipulative techniques, exploit people's vulnerabilities, or are used for social scoring.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know?\n\nLearn more\n\n# 2 of 5\n\nFigure 6. Current development of regulatory frameworks for the use of generative AI.\n\nIn academia, preventing students from using generative AI tools to write assignments is one of higher education’s biggest challenges. In one study, only 63% of the abstracts generated by ChatGPT were caught (Thorp 2023). Thus, there is an urgent need to establish regulations and develop detection techniques to prevent academic misconduct caused by generative AI effectively. Liebrenz et al. (2023) recommend establishing guidelines, plagiarism checks, and publication ethics for AI-generated content to protect authorship. To work towards responsible AI, practitioners can refer to a conceptual framework, the Five Ps, proposed by Nabavi and Browne (2023). Higher education institutions can implement this framework to maintain the credibility and integrity of their academic assessments and promote ethical AI use among students.\n\nThe challenges posed by generative AI, which include data protection and privacy, legal liability, impact on the labour market and social stability, and environmental concerns, require multidisciplinary and responsible solutions involving technical developments, legal frameworks, and societal collaboration between researchers, policymakers, industrial experts, and users.\n---\n# 6. Conclusion\n\nThe use of generative AI in business and finance can provide many benefits, including ease of access, cost savings, and improved efficiency. AI use is expected to become more widespread in the coming years. ChatGPT, an example of a powerful language-model-based chatbot, has been widely used to handle complex tasks in industry and academia; however, its capabilities are largely underexplored.\n\nThis article reviews recent studies in economics and finance, summarizes relevant applications of generative AI in industries and academia, and shows examples of using the latest generative AI tools, including ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard, to conduct analysis. Most importantly, we empirically evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to perform sentiment scoring for firms in the context of policy implementation. Using generative AI to analyze firms’ public statements can give financial market participants valuable insights into their perceived risks to their external environments. Section 4 shows that sentiment scores\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
