Ultimately, the field of business and society would like to support Proposition I. Empirically, however, no consistent support has been found for the proposition that CSR and lawful behavior are a sufficient condition.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\nfor increasing shareholder wealth: However; there are data available ~the results of event studies -the nature of which lends itself to supporting a proposition that, ceteris paribus, CSR and lawful behavior are a necessary condition for increasing shareholder wealth. Of course, other factors can be assigned a role in generating shareholder wealth without detracting from the necessity of CSR and lawful behavior: This leads to the second proposition:\n\n# Proposition 2\n\nIf firms do not act in a socially responsible and lawful manner; shareholder wealth is not increased.\n\nProposition 2 is a weak statement of the relationship between CSR, legal behavior; and shareholder wealth: It is also difficult to test empirically. Not acting in a socially responsible manner could mean acting irresponsibly, or it could mean acting in some \"neutral\" way that is not assessed within a responsibility/irresponsibility framework. Likewise, to say that shareholder wealth is not increased could be to say that shareholder wealth stays the same or decreases. Empirically, a workable test of Proposition 2 would be to assume that not acting in a socially responsible manner is equivalent to acting in a socially irresponsible manner; and then testing to see if shareholder wealth decreases. This leads to the third proposition:\n\n# Proposition 3\n\nIf firms act in a socially irresponsible or illegal manner; shareholder wealth is decreased.\n\nAlthough Proposition 3 is an oversimplification of reality, its strong grammatical form yields a conservative approach to testing indirectly the fundamental idea expressed in Proposition 2.\n\nIn short; the article presents an empirical analysis of the effects of socially irresponsible and illicit behavior on shareholder wealth, the results of which indicate that; ceteris paribus, Proposition 3 is a true statement. In other words, all other things equal, socially responsible and lawful behavior is necessary, though not sufficient; for shareholder wealth to be increased.\n\n# LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nOf course, in one sense, a meta-analysis might be thought of as an empirical literature review because it quantitatively summarizes the re-\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nResults of previously published works. In this sense, the rest of this article might be seen as a lengthy literature review. However, this article does focus its attention exclusively on the results of only one type of previously published work—event studies. Event studies, though, are a very recent phenomena, and researchers have been looking at the link between social and financial (including market) performance for quite some time. Indeed, as far back as the early 1970s, Milton Moskowitz (1972) called for empirical proof to verify the commonly held belief that economic incentives could be used to motivate companies to be socially responsible.\n\nDuring the 1970s and much of the 1980s, researchers published some 50 studies answering his call (Wood and Jones, 1995). The studies all sought a correlation between financial performance variables (e.g., accounting data, investor returns data, and risk data) and corporate social responsibility variables (e.g., existence and type of social programs; pollution performance, and reputation variables). Two previous review articles (Arlow and Gannon, 1982; Ullmann, 1985) that looked at many of these empirical studies found the results to be inconsistent; these two review articles, however, were done before anyone had begun applying event study methodology to the issue.\n\nEvent studies focus on a particular type of event—product recalls, for instance—and try to determine whether the stock market responds to the news of the event. In other words, at the time of a recall, does anything abnormal happen to the share price of a recalling firm, relative to how other stocks in the same risk class were performing at that time? To test for such \"abnormal\" behavior, event studies examine the effects of an event on many companies, never a single one. For example, an event study that considers the market's response to government-mandated automobile recalls (e.g., Bromiley and Marcus, 1989) does not look at a single recall by a single company on a single date. Rather, it looks at many recalls by all the companies in the industry over the course of many years. The sample of recalls is then statistically evaluated to see if across the sample the market reacted in a consistent manner (e.g., decreasing the value of firms recalling).\n\nThe theory underlying these event studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, originally proposed by Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969). The methodology was developed mainly by Fama (1970, 1976) and further refined by Brown and Warner (1980, 1985) and Dodd and Warner (1983). Meta-analysis is a quantitative review method used to synthesize the findings of previous empirical studies on an issue. Meta-analysis treats the results of each study it examines as a single data point. Because this article examines 27 event studies that have used incidences of socially responsible events...\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\ndata points.
