Summary statistics of time-series and cross-sectional regressions for 55 size-value and industry portfolios under the alternative temperature shock factor specifications\n\nPanel A summarizes time-series regressions to explain monthly excess returns on 55 size-value and industry portfolios. Panel A provides the average absolute value of the intercepts (|Alpha|), the average adjusted R² (AVG R²), and the GRS F-test statistic (GRS). Panel B reports the Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass OLS regressions results with 55 size-value and industry portfolios as the test assets. γ is the estimated risk premium associated with each factor. tEIV and tMIS are the Shanken (1992) errors-in-variables robust t-ratio and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) misspecification robust t-ratio, respectively. We also report the OLS cross-sectional adjusted R². The temperature shock factor specifications for ALT1, ALT2, and ALT3 are from equations (4a), (4b), and (4c), respectively. Since the temperature shock factor for ALT3 is not a return, alphas and GRS statistic are meaningless and are not reported for this case.\n\n# Panel A: Time-series regression summary statistics\n\n| ||Alpha||AVG R²|GRS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|ALT1|0.16|0.69|2.93*|\n|ALT2|0.15|0.69|2.86*|\n|ALT3|N.A.|0.66|N.A.|\n\n# Panel B: Cross-sectional regression summary statistics\n\n| |γ|tEIV|tMIS|p bootstrap|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|ALT1 Constant|0.83|3.75|3.73| |\n|ALT1 MKT|-0.17|-0.62|-0.62|[0.45]|\n|ALT1 TSF|-0.01|-2.72|-2.70|[0.06]|\n|ALT1 R²|0.27| | | |\n|ALT2 Constant|0.73|3.29|3.26| |\n|ALT2 MKT|-0.07|-0.25|-0.25|[0.48]|\n|ALT2 TSF|-0.03|-2.45|-2.42|[0.02]|\n|ALT2 R²|0.23| | | |\n|ALT3 Constant|0.71|3.05|2.99| |\n|ALT3 MKT|0.00|-0.01|-0.01|[0.51]|\n|ALT3 TSF*|-0.80|-1.92|-1.50|[0.06]|\n|ALT3 R²|0.07| | | |\n\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n37\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Table 4.
