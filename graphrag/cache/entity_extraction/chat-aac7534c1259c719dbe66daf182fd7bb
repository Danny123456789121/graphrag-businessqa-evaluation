If necessary, some of the effect sizes and variances were transformed or derived for the calculation of a second-order meta-analysis.\n\n# Calculation of distributions\n\n# Vote-count studies\n\nDistributions of positive, negative, neutral, and mixed outcomes are calculated for vote-count studies based on the results of the gross study sample and the net study sample. Within the gross study sample, it is possible that the same primary study is analyzed multiple times by different review study authors who may interpret each study differently. These interpretations are treated as independent study outcomes – no further adjustments are made. When a primary study is analyzed by more than one review author, the net study sample is adjusted for this constraint and different review authors’ interpretations are harmonized. On average, every unique primary study in the vote-count sample is analyzed by 1.8 review authors. To decide on the overall interpretation per unique study, a binomial test with three equally probable outcomes is applied (positive, neutral, and negative). A probability of greater than .95 served as cut-off point to determine the final interpretation for the study. If no clear positive or negative assignment was possible, the study is classified as neutral and/or mixed.\n\n# Meta-analyses\n\nVote-count reviewers provide an assessment of the extent to which an observed relation in a primary study is a significant outcome. When undertaking a meta-analysis of primary studies, this assessment is performed by the second-level reviewer. In order to adjust for significance of the results, we employ a 95% CI and 95% CrI based on the determined meta-analytical variance in the n = 25 meta-analyses. We calculate the 95% CI via the determined standard error (SE) for attenuated (r) and disattenuated (p) results.\n\nSEr = √ns = √∑i2ri and SEp = √np2\n\nCIL = 0 + 1.96(SEr/p) and CIU = 0 + 1.96(SEr/p)\n\nThe 95% CrI is then calculated via the standard deviation of the attenuated and disattenuated correlations.\n\nSDr = √ns = √∑i2ri and SDp = √np2\n\nCrIL = 0 + 1.96(SDr/p) and CrIU = 0 + 1.96(SDr/p)\n\nThe true variance for *r (the meta-analytical mean of attenuated correlations) is s2r = r and the corresponding variance for p (the meta-analytical mean of disattenuated correlations) is s2p*. As we are interested in the degree of significant positive and negative results, we place the intervals around zero instead of the meta-analytical mean. The resulting distributions may appear unusual on first glance as they define results significantly different from zero. The calculation is also conducted for the uncorrected and corrected correlations in the 551 primary studies, which possess transparent effect size data. We apply the same corresponding intervals that are utilized for the set of meta-analyses. Finally, we determine the number of studies that are above and below the intervals, categorize them as positive or negative and put them in relation with the sample size. All studies within the interval are classified as neutral.\n\n# Calculation of effect sizes\n\n# Vote-count studies\n\nEven though vote-count studies usually do not report effects sizes like standardized mean differences (d/g) or correlations, it is possible to approximate them with the provided data. Methods have been introduced during the time when broader application of meta-analytical techniques were being developed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hedges and Olkin 1985) and were further refined in the 1990s (Bushman 1994; Bushman and Wang 1995). The effect size *r is determined by calculating the ratio of p0 (r), which divides the number of positive studies by the sum of positive and negative studies, and by putting it in relation with the corresponding number of studies n. The estimation for the correlation coefficient r of a single vote-count study is subsequently determined through linear extrapolation based on the correlations coefficients provided (Hedges and Olkin 1985, 63ff). In a final step, the estimated correlation factors per vote-count study are sample-size weighted and aggregated to an overall estimation of the average correlation r* for the vote-count sample.\n\n# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment\n\n# Meta-analyses\n\nFirst-order meta-analytical results for the sample of primary studies are calculated with the Hunter–Schmidt approach (Hunter, Schmidt, and Jackson 1982; Hunter and Schmidt 2004). The approach is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al. 2011). It is similar to the second-order meta-analytical methodology which applies a fully random effect model.\n\nAll other average effect sizes and summary statistics of the 25 meta-analyses are determined with Schmidt and Oh’s method for second-order meta-analysis (Schmidt and Oh 2013). A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of methodologically comparable and independent first-order meta-analyses. It allows knowledge aggregation across a tremendous set of primary studies. Such a meta-analysis sample is potentially closer to a complete set of studies in certain research fields and allows for robust generalizations. Apart from the efficient aggregation of huge datasets, the method is statistically superior to other approaches for summarizing first-order meta-analyses. Conventional approaches will most likely provide inaccurate estimates of the true mean effect size and are prone to second-order sampling errors in the variances across all meta-analyses. The approach chosen considerably reduces the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
