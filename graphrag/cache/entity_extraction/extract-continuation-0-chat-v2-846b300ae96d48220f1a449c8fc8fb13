Yet, considerable skepticism remains, not least in the US where the Trump administration had worked to upend regulations that limit CO2 emissions. For example, Darren Woods, ExxonMobil’s CEO, recently declared that “Individual companies setting targets and then selling assets to another company so that their portfolio has a different carbon intensity has not solved the problem for the world.” And that ExxonMobil was “taking steps to solve the problem for society as a whole and not try and get into a beauty competition.”3\n\nThe lack of consensus among institutional investors around climate change naturally raises the possibility that carbon risk may not yet be reflected in asset prices. To find out, in this paper we systematically explore whether investors demand a carbon risk premium by looking at how stock returns vary with CO2 emissions across firms and industries. We undertake a standard cross-sectional analysis, asking whether carbon emissions affect cross-sectional US stock returns.\n\nThere are several ways in which one might expect CO2 emissions to affect stock returns. First, since CO2 emissions are tied to fossil-fuel energy use, returns are affected by fossil-fuel energy prices and commodity price risk. Relatedly, firms with disproportionately high CO2 emissions may be exposed to carbon pricing risk and other regulatory interventions to limit emissions. The firms that are most reliant on fossil energy are also more exposed to technology risk from lower-cost renewable energy. Forward-looking investors may seek compensation for holding the stocks of disproportionately high CO2 emitters and the associated higher carbon risk they expose themselves to, giving rise to a positive relation in the cross-section between a firm’s own CO2 emissions and its stock returns. We refer to this as the carbon risk premium hypothesis.\n\nAn interesting question is whether carbon emissions are perceived to be a systematic risk factor and whether the carbon risk premium is tied to loadings on this risk factor. Carbon emissions could be a systematic risk factor if expected regulatory interventions to curb emissions apply uniformly to all emissions. For example, if a large federal carbon tax were to be introduced, this would be a systematic shock affecting all companies with significant emissions. Alternatively, most regulatory interventions could be introduced in a piecemeal way at the state, industry, and municipal level. Similarly, technological improvements in the use of renewable energy could be mostly targeted to particular operations or sectors. In this case, one would not expect carbon emissions to be a systematic risk factor.\n\n1 See http://www.climateaction100.org/\n\n2 Statement made by Adam Matthews, the fund’s director of ethics and engagement. The Church of England Pension Fund is co-chairing the IIGCC initiative.\n\n3 Quoted in Exxon CEO Calls Rivals’ Climate Targets a ‘Beauty Competition’ by Kevin Crowley, Bloomberg News, March 5, 2020, https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/exxon-ceo-calls-rivals-climate-targets-a-beauty-competition-1.1400957.\n\nA second hypothesis is that financial markets are pricing carbon risk inefficiently and the risk associated with carbon emissions is underpriced. Carbon risk may not be fully integrated by most investors, who by force or habit look at future cash-flow projections through local thinking à la Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010), ignoring unrepresentative information about global warming and its attendant risks. To be sure, the cash-flow scenarios commonly used by financial analysts do not directly refer to carbon emissions and their possible future repricing. A recent study by In, Park, and Monk (2019) on a different sample than ours finds that a portfolio that is long stocks of companies with low carbon emissions and short stocks of companies with high emissions generates positive abnormal returns. We refer to this hypothesis as the market inefficiency, or carbon alpha, hypothesis. An important question we explore is whether financial markets underprice carbon risk (after controlling for other known risk factors, industry, and firm characteristics) to the point that responsible investors, who care about carbon emissions and climate change, could be “doing well by doing good.”\n\nA third hypothesis is that the stocks of firms with high emissions are like other “sin stocks”; they are shunned by socially responsible, or ethical, investors to such an extent that the spurned firms present higher stock returns. A key question in this respect is how investors identify the firms to be divested from. Do they look at carbon emissions at the firm level, or do they pigeonhole firms into broader categories such as the industry they operate in? Even socially responsible investors that care about climate change may use sparse models (à la Gabaix, 2014) and not look much beyond industry categorizations, such as the energy and electric utility sectors, which produce a disproportionate share of CO2 emissions. Prominent divestors like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, for example, who have pledged to divest from fossil fuel companies, largely focus on energy companies that extract coal and oil from tar sands. We refer to this as the divestment hypothesis.\n\nA pioneer in producing company-level CO2 emissions data is the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). It has been joined by other leading providers of carbon data, including MSCI ESG Research and Trucost, among others. While more and more institutional investors make use of the data, it is not known how much individual companies’ stock returns are actually affected by the availability of these more granular CO2 emissions data to financial analysts. Our study relies on the Trucost EDX data, which cover around 1,000 listed companies since fiscal year 2005, and over 2,900 listed companies in the US since fiscal year 2016. We match these data with the FactSet returns and balance sheet data for all US-listed companies from 2005 to 2017.\n\nCarbon emissions from a company’s operations and economic activity are typically grouped into three different categories: direct emissions from production\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXXONMOBIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ExxonMobil is a multinational oil and gas corporation known for its significant CO2 emissions and efforts to address climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARREN WOODS<|>PERSON<|>Darren Woods is the CEO of ExxonMobil, who has publicly commented on the company's approach to carbon emissions and climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUCOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trucost is a provider of carbon data that helps investors assess the carbon emissions of companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is an organization that collects and publishes data on company-level CO2 emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCKEFELLER BROTHERS FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Rockefeller Brothers Fund is a philanthropic organization known for its commitment to divesting from fossil fuel companies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|>GEO<|>The United States, where skepticism about carbon emissions regulations has been prevalent, particularly during the Trump administration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CO2 EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>CO2 emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a significant factor in climate change and is being analyzed for its impact on stock returns.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARREN WOODS<|>EXXONMOBIL<|>Darren Woods is the CEO of ExxonMobil and has made statements regarding the company's carbon emissions strategy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUCOST<|>CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT<|>Both Trucost and the Carbon Disclosure Project provide data on carbon emissions to help investors make informed decisions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCKEFELLER BROTHERS FUND<|>EXXONMOBIL<|>The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has pledged to divest from fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US<|>EXXONMOBIL<|>ExxonMobil operates within the US, where regulations on CO2 emissions have been a contentious issue<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CO2 EMISSIONS<|>EXXONMOBIL<|>ExxonMobil is a significant emitter of CO2 emissions, which impacts its stock performance and investor perception<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CO2 EMISSIONS<|>TRUCOST<|>Trucost analyzes CO2 emissions data, which is crucial for understanding the financial implications of carbon risk<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
