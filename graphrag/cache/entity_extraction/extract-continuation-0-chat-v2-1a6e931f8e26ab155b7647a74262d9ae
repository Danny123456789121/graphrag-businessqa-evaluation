Methodology\n\nTo gain a deep understanding of how a business adopts a Thai Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve its sustainability performance, a qualitative approach is used to explore how corporate leaders ensure organizational sustainability. Figure 2 presents the research methodology process. We start with a literature review relevant to the Sufficiency Economy philosophy and corporate sustainability. The search keywords include sustainability, sufficiency economy, corporate sustainability, social enterprise, and sustainable enterprise without a specific timeframe.\n\n|Literature review|Questions development|Multi-data collection|Data analysis|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Observation|Stakeholder interviews|Documentation|Coding adopting the Sufficiency Thinking model|\n\nThen, a set of open-ended questions is developed since we want to explore how corporate leaders practically ensure their organizational sustainability. In order to answer the research question, a case sample of a Thai small and medium enterprise is used. The case sample named “Plan Creation or PlanToys” was purposively selected because this organization has adopted the SEP concept according to Thailand’s Office of the Royal Development Projects Board (ORDPB). Interviewees, including stakeholders, were purposively sampled to provide answers to relevant aspects and questions. Stakeholders were face-to-face interviewed, including the Managing Director, ten department managers, ten employees, three customers and six people living in the nearby communities.\n\nThe Managing Director was asked about how he led and managed his organization. The ten department managers were interviewed about the management practices of their relevant departments. The ten employees were interviewed about the business practices and quality of life at work, while the three customers and six people from the surrounding communities were interviewed about their experience with the sample SME. These informants are chosen on a convenient basis. Probing, reflective note-taking, critical incident technique and non-participant observations were used during two visits to the company to improve data validity. All interviews were tape-recorded with permission from the interviewees and from the sample company. All recorded interviews were transcribed into a text-based document. Secondary data from other sources such as media reports and Facebook were also collected.\n\nWe adopt the triangulation approach to data collection to ensure an acceptable level of validity and objectivity. In doing so, we concurrently improve the rigor of the present study as it allows us to draw rich data from a set of various perspectives from multiple data collection techniques and different actors from different organizational levels as well as key actors from outside the organization such as external stakeholders.\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\n# 7 of 19\n\nAs for data analysis, qualitative data collection and analysis generally take place simultaneously as researchers try to draw meaning and develop understanding slowly over time in a non-linear manner. By design, we therefore transcribe the interviews by ourselves. We adopt the deductive approach by choosing the framework approach to qualitative data analysis that involves coding the qualitative data based on a theoretically and empirically pre-determined research framework (Figure 2) since we can anticipate the likely responses from the interviewees based on the literature. This framework approach has been used to manage and analyze qualitative data since the 1980s [29] as it helps researchers to focus the coding on those critical issues in the extant literature. The framework approach is also relevant to our cross-sectional analysis with descriptive data as it allows us to see different aspects of the observed phenomena under examination [29]. In doing so, our interpretations of informants’ responses and experiences are transparent [29], and demonstrate the relationship between different stages of analysis [30,31]. With a series of interconnected stages, the framework approach also allows us to move back and forth across the data until we arrive at a coherent account [29].\n\nIn fact, we finally convert the research framework in Figure 2 into a working analytical framework to clearly demonstrate the relationship between the Sufficiency Thinking model and received respondents’ answers. As our analysis tool, this working analytical framework as shown in Table 3 comprises a set of codes grouped according to the research framework. The working analytical framework assists us in managing and organizing the data, acts as a new structure for the data, is useful for summarizing and minimizing the data, and supports us in investigating the research question.\n\n|No.|Coded Interview|Informant|Data Type|Sufficiency Virtues|Knowledge Mindset|Sufficiency Practice|SL Outputs|Quadruple Bottom Line|Well-Being Sustainability|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|“PlanToys products help to support child development very well”.|Customer|PlanToys TH|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|\n|2|“The strength of the company in relation to community is the environmental concern.
