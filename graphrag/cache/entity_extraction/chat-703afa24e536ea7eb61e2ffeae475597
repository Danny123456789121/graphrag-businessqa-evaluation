Identify all entities.

We applied a definition of ESG that reflects the exemplary list of variables of Clarkson (1995), Wood (2010), and the investment approaches in GSIA (2013). We did not differentiate whether the motives for ESG performance of the firm are for altruistic or strategic reasons (McGuire 1969; Baron 2001; McWilliams, Siegel, and Wright 2006). CFP measures were defined as accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk measures, and the performance of ESG portfolios (Cochran and Wood 1984; Orlitzky and Benjamin 2001; Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes 2003; Peloza 2009). We also considered specific parts of a study (Viviers and Eccles 2012; Mayer-Haug et al. 2013; Stam, Arzlanian, and Elfring 2014) when its focus was not entirely on the ESG–CFP relation – provided a vote-count estimate or effect size calculation was possible. In case of different versions of a review study, the latest version – or ideally, the published version – remained in our sample. All studies were required to be available in electronic format. The cut-off date for study inclusion was online availability until December 2014.\n\n# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment\n\n# Table 1.
