Plewnia, E. Guenther\n\nResearchers can measure variables in a temporal sequence by introducing a time lag. If, for example, CFP is measured 1 year after the corporate donation amount was measured (subsequent measurement), a statistical correlation between the two measures can plausibly be interpreted to imply that CP has an effect on CFP. If both indicators are assessed at the same time (concurrent measurement), on the other hand, no causal relationship can be inferred from the results (Bausch and Pils 2009).\n\nTo take implemented time lags into consideration, CFP indicators are assessed as to whether they are measured prior, concurrently, or subsequently to the CP indicator. The consideration of these time lagged measurements within all study designs and across all subgroups of effect sizes is a key aspect within this study. The relationship we want to focus on is between CP and subsequently measured CFP to assess the causal effect of CP on the latter. The existence of this effect would also suggest that CP activities need to be integrated into management control systems to exploit positive outcomes of CP, such as stakeholder reputation and employee motivation, and limit negative consequences in the form of managerial opportunism.\n\nBesides the temporal sequence of measured events, another important aspect that needs to be considered is the temporal distance of indicator measurement (Mitchell and James 2001). As positive reputation and employee motivation, representing the main mediators for the effect of CP on CFP, can be considered as inducing mid- or long-term effects, a time frame of at least 1 year seems adequate. Conveniently, when studies investigate this relationship and consider the temporal sequence for these two variables, they usually depend on archival data provided on a yearly basis and, thus, implement a sufficient time lag of at least 1 year.\n\nIf we want to lead a more specific discussion on two variables’ relationship including causality effects, we need to differentiate empirical studies that considered the temporal sequence of variable measurement. Therefore, based on RQ1, our research question 2 (RQ2) focuses on differences in findings for prior, concurrent, and subsequent measurement of CFP in relation to CP.\n\n# RQ2: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that used different temporal sequences of variable measurement?\n\n# 2.3 Study design factors\n\nEven if a relationship between CP and subsequent CFP can be empirically shown to allow for the inference of causality, the important question of the conditions under which this relationship holds remains. After all, the existence of a positive or negative relationship might depend on differences concerning the study design and the context of respective CP activities. To account for these differences within a meta-analysis, empirical results can be sorted into subgroups according to their study design attributes and contextual factors. This kind of subgroup analysis might shed some light on questions about the conditions under which CP can have a significant influence on CFP. As a consequence, it needs to be investigated how the relationship is influenced by different study designs. While RQ3 postulates the general question on this issue, the following subquestions demand more specific answers for different subgroups of studies.\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\n# RQ3: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to study design?\n\n# Operationalization of CFP\n\nAn important and usual attribute to start with is the measurement of CFP (Combs et al. 2005; Hamann et al. 2013). Other studies investigating the relationship between CFP and CSP or corporate environmental performance (CEP) have mainly focused on the differentiation of accounting-based indicators, e.g., return on assets (ROA) or return on equity (ROE), and market-based measures, e.g., stock market returns or market risk values (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Allouche and Laroche 2005; Margolis et al. 2009; Endrikat et al. 2014). Following these approaches, the same classification is introduced for CFP measures in this study. Earlier meta-analyses have found that the correlations between CSP and CFP are stronger when using accounting-based rather than market-based measures of CFP (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Margolis et al. 2009). The argument which was used to explain these findings is presented by Wood and Jones (1995), who argue that “there is no theory to explain why stockholders would or would not prefer a company that gives one percent of pre-tax earnings to charity […]”. Building on these findings, research question 3a asks:\n\n# RQ3a: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the employed CFP indicator?\n\n# Operationalization of CP\n\nJust as there exist different possibilities to measure CFP, several distinct indicators have been used to represent the philanthropic activities of firms. While some have measured CP by a dummy variable, evaluating the overall existence of charitable donations (Hall and Rieck 1998; Qiu 2013), others have assessed the total amount of donations made (Patten 2008; Wang and Qian 2011), and again others computed the percentage of donated amounts relative to total assets, pre-tax income, or sales (Jia and Zhang 2014; Chen et al. 2015; Iatridis 2015). Generosity in the form of relative donations could be more important to customers and other stakeholders than the absolute amount of donations (Patten 2008) or the mere existence of donations. Furthermore, according to the theory of an inverted u-shaped relationship between CP and CFP (Wang et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2015), one could expect that the initial participation in donation programs yields higher CFP benefits than ever-increasing\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F.
