Once the stated factors and elements discussed above are considered in the entire process of policymaking, it will adequately address policy and practice gaps. Furthermore, it is also learned that, in many cases, states and governments’ intervention becomes imperative to make the policies successful and achieve desired results.\n\nIn the context of policymaking, it is identified that SMEs by their structure has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include informal ways of communications, less bureaucratic environment, speedy decision-making, direct interaction with customers and clients, and lean organizational structure. Simultaneously, disadvantages include lack of finances, lack of knowledge, and lack of expert human resource for sustainability issues. The disadvantages are like barriers and posing challenges for integrating the SME’s business activities with sustainability (Klewitz et al. 2012).\n\nIt is evident in the literature that the organization implements the environmental policy because of the reasons such as government laws and regulation, stakeholder’s pressure, competitor’s pressure, economic advantages (Bansal and Roth 2000; Mubarik 2015; Khan et al. 2020; Mubarik and Naghavi 2020; Alam et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2019). Another view to bridge the gaps between the policy and implementation needs a thorough translation of the policy into action plans, such as setting the objective, preparing the guidelines, and action plans (Epstein and Roy 2007) (see Figs. 2 and 3).\n\n# Limitation\n\nSince the CS\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
