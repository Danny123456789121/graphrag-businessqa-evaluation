In this application we estimate the expected equity loss conditional on the greenness and transparency factor return defined in Equation (7) realizing a gain greater than Γ, i.e. a scenario where greener and more transparent stocks outperform brown stocks by more than a particular threshold. Hence, we can write the MES as follows:\n\nM ESj,t = −E[rj,t| − fg,t < −Γ], (13)\n\n= −E[rj,t|fg,t > Γ]. (14)\n\nWe compute the MES considering the following three cases, which are defined in terms of portfolio allocation:\n\n- Baseline Case: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as in Equation (12) and reflects the actual allocation of institutional sectors and financial institutions as in Battiston et al. (2017). The portfolio share invested in each of the stocks included in on our sample is derived accordingly.\n- Case 1: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as rj,t = ∑ωj,1r1,t + ωj,1rt + ∑ωj,κrκ,t, where the exposure to the fossil fuel sector, characterized by the highest emissions, is reduced by 50% compared to the baseline. At the same time, we assume that investments are reallocated to greener and more transparent stocks, defined as the stocks with a positive exposition to the greenness and transparency factor.\n- Case 2: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as rj,t = ∑ωj,κrκ,t, i.e. only greener and more transparent stocks, as defined above, are included in the portfolio.\n\nIn all three cases, the M ESj,t is computed w.r.t. the event fg,t > q0.95, where q0.95 indicates the 95th percentile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency factor. This corresponds to an extreme, but still plausible scenario.\n\nTables 7 and 8 report MES results for the institutional sectors at the global level and for European SIFIs, respectively. The MES is expressed both as percentage loss and in billions of US dollars. Looking at Table 7, the average MES at the global level in the baseline scenario, i.e. given the actual portfolio allocation in 2015, is estimated to be -1.5%. The very limited variation across institutional sectors and institutions indicates that no one would be immune. A loss of -1.5% on equity portfolios globally corresponds to USD 387 bn. For comparison, this figure is close to the total disbursements under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), through which the US Government purchased or insured troubled assets between 2008 and 2014. Table 7 also shows what would happen should a global portfolio reallocation take place. The figures obtained under Scenario 1 indicate that halving the exposure to carbon-intensive activities would reduce the MES only marginally. Losses would be avoided only under Scenario 2, characterized by a radical portfolio reallocation.\n\nTurning to Table 8, we estimate a loss of -1.6%, with individual banks recording losses of up to -2.2% on their\n\n23\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nequity portfolio. An average loss of -1.6% for European SIFIs corresponds to almost USD 7 bn. These figures are admittedly not breathtaking, and one might argue that losses of this magnitude would be unlike to trigger a financial crisis. However, this exercise only focuses on equity exposures, and only on first-round losses. Actually, one should consider that a scenario where greener assets very much outperform brown ones would be rooted into a deep transformation of the economy as a whole. The low-carbon transition, if implemented in a sudden and disorderly manner, would be associated with stranded assets and non-performing loans, on top of losses on the stock market, which would also very much weigh on bank’s profits. In fact, only a comparatively small fraction of the overall exposure of banks to carbon-intensive economic sectors is due to banks’ equity holdings. Moreover, the stress-testing literature has shown that second-round effects, such as contagion dynamics, the devaluation of counterparties’ debt obligations, as well as the price impact of fire sales, may considerably amplify first-round losses. In particular, works based on network models show that second-round losses are comparable in magnitude to first round losses (see Battiston et al. (2017) and references therein). Having said that, our data is not granular enough to estimate the amount of second-round losses that could add up to first-round impacts in a scenario like the one we are considering. Moreover, the MES-based stress-testing tool we propose is specifically targeted to assess climate risk in the equity portfolio. However, it’s worth recalling that the global financial crisis, culminating in trillions of losses in world GDP, was triggered by writedowns on the value of loans and securitized assets due to the US subprime crisis, which for many banks amounted to just few billions.\n\n# Table 7\n\nThe table reports the M ES in percentage terms and in billions of dollars, for the three scenarios, for global institutional sectors.
