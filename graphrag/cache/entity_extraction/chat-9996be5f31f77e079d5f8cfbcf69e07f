In other words, ﬁnancially successful ﬁrms may have the resources necessary to improve their environmental performance, which in turn increases ﬁnancial ben- eﬁts that again can be ploughed back into further improvements of CEP.\n\nWhile temporal precedence is not identical to causality it is at least a strong indicator for it (e.g., Bono & McNamara, 2011; Mitchell & James, 2001; Wagner & Blom, 2011).\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Endrikat, J., et al. Making sense of conﬂicting empirical ﬁndings: A meta-analytic review of the relationship between corporate environmental and ﬁnancial performance. European Management Journal (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2013.12.004\n\n6 J. Endrikat et al. / European Management Journal xxx (2014) xxx–xxx\n\nsion (i.e., outcome-based CEP). Process-based CEP refers to a stra-\n\ntegic level and focuses on managerial principles and processes such\n\nas environmental objectives, environmental policies, or environ-\n\nmental management structures. Thus, process-based CEP reﬂects\n\na ﬁrm’s internal efforts to address environmental issues (Busch &\n\nHoffmann, 2011). Outcome-based CEP reﬂects the observable and\n\nquantiﬁable results of these efforts (Delmas & Nairn-Birch, 2011)\n\nand refers to measures such as the amount of released pollutants\n\nor the ratio of recycled waste to total waste. In general, process-\n\nbased CEP can be considered a precursor of outcome-based CEP\n\n(e.g., Klassen & McLaughlin, 1996; Xie & Hayase, 2007). However,\n\nit should be noted that research has shown that process-based\n\nCEP does not inevitably lead to improved outcome-based CEP in\n\nall cases (Darnall & Sides, 2008; Jung, Kim, & Rhee, 2001; Nawrocka\n\n& Parker, 2009).10\n\nGiven the substantial differences between the process-based\n\ndimension of CEP and the outcome-based dimension, it is reason-\n\nable to suggest that the relationship between CEP and CFP varies\n\ndepending on which CEP dimension is addressed. Busch and Hoff-\n\nmann (2011), for example, found that process-based CEP (in terms\n\nof carbon management) negatively affects CFP, while outcome-\n\nbased CEP (in terms of carbon emissions) has a positive inﬂuence\n\non CFP. Contrary, Delmas et al. (2013) in a recent study found\n\nthe process dimension to be correlated with CFP while the out-\n\ncome dimension showed no signiﬁcant correlation. As we do not\n\nhave strong reasoning as to whether the relationship would be\n\nstronger for process-based CEP or for outcome-based CEP, we do\n\nnot offer directional hypotheses in this regard.\n\nAside from distinguishing between process-based CEP and out-\n\ncome-based CEP, CEP can be differentiated with regard to a ﬁrm’s\n\nunderlying strategic approach to dealing with environmental is-\n\nsues. The strategic approach can be conceived in terms of a contin-\n\nuum ranging from reactive to proactive (e.g., Aragón-Correa, 1998;\n\nBuysse & Verbeke, 2003; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma & Vreden-\n\nburg, 1998). Reactive approaches aim at compliance with environ-\n\nmental regulations and imply environmental activities to a\n\nminimum level, usually referring to end-of-pipe solutions. Such\n\napproaches emphasize the minimization of risk and liabilities\n\nand do not fundamentally change a ﬁrm’s processes (Russo &\n\nFouts, 1997; Walls et al., 2011). Contrary, proactive approaches re-\n\nfer to environmental practices that go beyond compliance, focus on\n\npollution prevention activities, and involve higher-order learning\n\nand redesign of existing processes (Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma,\n\n2000; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). King and Lenox (2002) showed\n\nthat ﬁrms pursuing a proactive approach (pollution prevention)\n\nexperience superior ﬁnancial performance, while ﬁrms pursuing\n\na reactive approach (end-of-pipe pollution control) fail to do so.\n\nThe theoretical rationale for this observation is that reactive ap-\n\nproaches do “not require the ﬁrm to develop expertise or skills in\n\nmanaging new environmental technologies or processes” (Russo\n\n& Fouts, 1997, p. 538), while proactive approaches involve the\n\ndevelopment of organizational resources and capabilities that are\n\npotential sources of competitive advantage and that affect a ﬁrm’s\n\nability to gain ﬁnancial beneﬁts from improved CEP (Hart, 1995;\n\nHart & Dowell, 2011; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000; Sharma\n\n& Vredenburg, 1998).\n\nHypothesis 1a. Process-based CEP is positively related to subse-\n\nquent market-based CFP.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
