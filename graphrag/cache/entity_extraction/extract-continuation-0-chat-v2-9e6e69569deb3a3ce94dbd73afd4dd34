We use the sentiment score from ChatGPT 4 as the main score, while the sentiment score from ChatGPT 3.5 is used as a supplemental score. We also opt for the Spearman Rank definition of correlation as it is non-parametric and allows us to gain insights into whether the ordering of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 generated sentiment scores has fundamentally changed (Stevenson, Mues, and Bravo 2021). The correlation coefficient is 0.970, indicating a high correlation between both sentiment scores. We obtained company financial information from Compustat for the period 2008–2017.\n\nIn Table 1, R&D is the ratio of firms’ R&D expenditures scaled by total assets. Leverage is the ratio of total debt to total assets. Cap-trade is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the observation is in 2013 or later and 0 otherwise. Mention is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the annual report mentions the keywords ‘cap-and-trade’ or ‘cap and trade’ in 2011 and 0 otherwise. Sentiment 4 and Sentiment 3.5 are sentiment scores generated by ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT 3.5 based on analyzing sentences in companies’ annual reports related to cap-and-trade policies. Higher scores indicate more negative company sentiment towards the cap-and-trade policy. We controlled for the one-year lagged value of firm size (Ln total assets), the cash holdings ratio (cash holdings/total assets), and the ROA ratio. Our model included firm fixed effects.\n\nThe results show that firms mentioning keywords increased their R&D ratios by 8.3% and reduced their leverage ratios by 55.3% after the cap-and-trade program compared with firms that did not mention these keywords. This result is consistent with real options theory (Dixit, Dixit, and Pindyck 1994) that uncertainty in the external environment tends to discourage firms from making long-term investments.
