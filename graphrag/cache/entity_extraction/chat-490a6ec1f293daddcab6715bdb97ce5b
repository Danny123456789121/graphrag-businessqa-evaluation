Best Practices with GAI and Customer Experience Journey\n\nThe emergence of GAI capabilities has compelled businesses to reconsider their approach to engaging with customers and building lasting relationships. To achieve this, companies must begin by developing a strategy that involves an active presence in the GAI ecosystem. With GAI, businesses can transform the way they interact with their customers, seamlessly engaging with them across physical and virtual environments. In B2C interactions, customers should be empowered to create their own experiences by leveraging technology, enabling them to promote brands in a more immersive and engaging manner.\n\nThe customer journey consists of several distinct phases, beginning before using GAI, then during use, and post-use. Consumers can consume and distribute content simultaneously through the multiple media and information resources produced during the\n\njourney [30, 32]. Today, many consumers spend a considerable amount of time researching and communicating before making a purchasing decision. During this process, they can access various interfaces and tools that enable them to manage their options and make informed choices. GAI eliminates the need for manual data analysis and can provide diverse solutions to meet customers’ needs, making it valuable in use cases that involve environments. Due to the emergence of new technologies such as smart devices and networks, it is now possible for customers to share their experiences in real time [32]. Personal decisions are often influenced by the stimuli encountered while using a product or service, and these experiences can be shared with others through social media or blogs.\n\nGAI technology seamlessly enables businesses to interact with their customers in physical and virtual environments. It allows them to operate in hybrid mode, making it easier to switch between the two [33]. It also bridges the physical and digital worlds, allowing them to implement various experiences seamlessly. Figure 2 shows how consumers can interact with GAI before, during, and after using it. It means that different aspects of the customer experience can be performed using this technology. Because of this, consumers are more likely to develop an immersive relationship with their brands.\n\n# Figure 2. Customer experience and co-creation process with GAI. Source: authors’ conception.\n\nThe increasing importance of customer-to-customer (C2C) interactions is becoming more critical as businesses look to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations. With the help of GAI, they can create and share rich and interactive experiences designed to make their interactions more effortless [34]. GAI enables interactions to share information and experiences, allowing businesses to deliver a more seamless customer experience. In real time, consumers can also engage and influence each other. Collaborations with other organizations can provide customers with a complete and unified experience. After interacting with ChatGPT and Bard, consumers can freely share their experiences on GAI, influencing both physical and virtual environments. Figure 3 represents the theoretical model of integration for B2C and C2C.\n\n# Technologies 2023, 11, 44\n\n# 6. Discussion of GAI and Business\n\nGAI tools are utilized in various functions in the banking industry, such as fraud detection and data privacy. In the education sector, these tools can be used to create personalized learning programs that cater to students’ different learning styles [32, 34]. In the fashion industry, GAI is used to design models of different clothing types. Furthermore, the healthcare industry can use GAI to enhance the efficiency of medical imaging and drug discovery. Although the ethical issues surrounding AI have been widely discussed in the past few years, the discussion about GAI is relatively new. The emergence of ChatGPT by OpenAI has quickly made it famous. The language model can create high-quality content across various topics. Here are the most common ethical concerns that people have about GAI:\n\n- One of the ethical concerns is that GAI tools can create and distribute fake videos or images that are humiliating or negative. Machine learning techniques can create deep fakes, artificial images, and audio that are not real. Such content can be challenging to distinguish from real-world media, raising ethical issues [35]. Deep fakes can also spread misinformation, and they can also harass and defame individuals.\n- The accuracy and truthfulness of information are both threatened by machine learning. For instance, large language models such as ChatGPT do not keep up with the changes in the world around them [36]. Despite the increasing number of persuasive and eloquent language models, they can still be used to create false and misleading information. For instance, they can make up conspiracy theories that could cause significant harm. Before implementing GAI tools, the individuals and organizations that use them must check the truthfulness of the information they produce.\n- One ethical issue concerning GAI is the copyright\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
