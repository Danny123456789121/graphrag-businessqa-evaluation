As a consequence, the notion that CP only inflicts costs needs to be finally left behind as it might mistakenly direct decision-makers to abandon their CP activities. It is important to make clear that CP can make an important contribution to both society’s well-being and a corporation’s economic success.\n\n# Compliance with ethical standards\n\nConflict of interest: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest\n\n# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…\n\n# Appendix 1\n\n# Coding on observation level - Effect size data (own illustration)\n\n# Effect size data on observation level\n\n|Reported effect size statistic|- Bivariate correlation|\n|---|---|\n| |• Correlation coefficient (r)|\n| |• Group comparison (F, p, t, Z)|\n| |- Partial correlation|\n| |• Group comparison (F, p, t, Z)|\n| |• Regression coefficient (p, S E, t)|\n\n# CP indicator\n\n- Donation amount- Donation dummy- Generosity (relative donations)\n\n# Financial indicator type / Financial indicator\n\nAccounting-based CFP measure- Altman Z-score (hybrid)- Return on assets (ROA)- Return on equity (ROE)- Return on capital employed (ROCE)- Earnings per share (EPS; hybrid)- Earnings before taxes (EBT)(Stock) Market-based CFP measure- Access to funding- Market model alpha- Market risk (Beta)- Market valuation premium- Stock Return (abnormal or excess returns)- Tobin’s Q (hybrid)\n\n# Time lag (measurement of CFP variable in relation to the CP variable)\n\n- Prior- Concurrent- Subsequent\n\n# Effect size\n\nReported in or converted to correlation coefficient r.\n\n# Sample size\n\nReported in firm years per observation\n\n# Sign\n\n- Negative (2)- Positive (3)\n\nNote.
