This table shows the results from Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis for the CEP–CFP relation. Data are split according to the CEP strategy applied and the mean sample year of the analyzed data, while simultaneously splitting the sample according to the number of lagged years j between the two constructs. n is the number of studies, and k is the number of effect sizes. Besides, the random‐effects mean effect sizes and their standard errors are shown. CEP: corporate environmental performance; CFP: corporate financial performance.\n\naDue to the small number of observed effect estimates, the calculations cannot be performed completely for this subgroup.\n\n*Significant at 10% level; **Significant at 5% level; ***Significant at 1% level.\n\n# 5 CONCLUSION\n\nExtending existing meta‐studies on the relation between CEP and CFP (Albertini, 2013; Dixon‐Fowler et al., 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Guenther et al., 2012; Hang et al., 2018; Horváthová, 2010), the aim of this paper is to shed light on the reverse causality between both constructs by applying meta‐analysis on a sample of 893 effect sizes.\n\n# HANG ET AL.\n\nOur findings suggest that in the short term (1 year), financial resources can increase a firm's environmental performance as proposed by the slack resources hypothesis; however, the effects disappear in the long term (more than 1 year). Conversely, increasing environmental performance has no short‐term effect on a firm's financial performance, whereas a firm significantly benefits in the long term following the Porter hypothesis. In contrast, the concurrent/synergetic effect is significantly positive but economically insignificant. Overall, our results imply that the causality between environmental performance and financial performance depends on the time horizon. This result is not affected by publication bias. However, meta‐regression analysis reveals that the CEP–CFP relation decreases over time and is significantly smaller for reactive environmental investments. To sum up, our results should encourage managers to stick to a proactive environmental policy and not to abandon the investments if the financial success is not immediately visible.\n\nFuture research might especially point to the temporal structure of causal effects for different environmental practices on a fine‐grained level. For a more detailed understanding (also on a meta‐level), additional studies examining long‐term effects are also needed. Moreover, future studies might investigate the causality between CEP and CFP assuming non‐linear relations (Fujii et al., 2013).\n\n# ORCID\n\nMarkus Hang http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0204-400X\n\nJerome Geyer‐Klingeberg http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6615-7439\n\n# REFERENCES\n\n*The references marked with an asterisk are included in the meta‐analytic data set.\n\n- *Ağan, Y., Kuzey, C., Acar, M.
