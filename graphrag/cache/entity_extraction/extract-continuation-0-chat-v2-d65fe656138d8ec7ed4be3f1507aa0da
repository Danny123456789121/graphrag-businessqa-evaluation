Although adherence to the plan is on a voluntary basis, seemingly users wanted to see information regarding these areas being disclosed in annual and sustainability reports.\n\nWith regard to social disclosure, it is notable that “product responsibility” indicators generally received a high level of perceived importance. Product responsibility is another area of concern in China, because of prior severe food product faults and the milk powder scandal in the community. In comparison with existing research (Chow and Chen, 2012; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017), product safety on customer health was broadly found as an essential factor perceived by report preparers. It is evident that the concerns and the fear of product safety in China are far from resolved. While other social items (e.g. occupational health and safety, employment, security practice, indigenous rights, investment and compliance) also show high consistency with prior literature, the majority of the social related sustainability information was not perceived importantly because of their exclusion from regulations and the voluntary nature in the Western context (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Chow and Chen, 2012; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017).\n\nEconomic disclosure was perceived as less important in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. Information included in economic disclosure presents a measurement of the economic outcomes of a company and the effect and relevance of these outcomes on a broad range of stakeholders. As most of the economic disclosure can be obtained from the annual reports, it may be considered less relevant within the context of sustainability reporting, in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. However, economic disclosures were perceived to be much more important in the Western settings (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008; Rueda-Manzanares et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2007). This is consistent without discussion in Section 2.1 that the Western context considers sustainability as a way to stretch the wealth creation, thereby producing the long-term sustainable economic performance (Zhang et al., 2018). In our results, we detected negative associations, which indicate that economic information is considered less attractive because the disclosures may have been released in financial reports.\n\njSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j\n\n|CSR items|Amaral and La Rovere (2003)|Baumgartner and Ebner (2010)|Erol et al.
