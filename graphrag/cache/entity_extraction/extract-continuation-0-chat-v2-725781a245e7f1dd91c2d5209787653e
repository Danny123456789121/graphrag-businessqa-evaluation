As mentioned, we followed the definitions of prototypical user questions in XAI Question Bank by Liao et al. [48] and “intelligibility types” in Lim and Dey [53] to code the following categories: Input, Output, Performance, Data, How (global), Why/Why NOT, How to, What if, Control. We further identified two new categories that were not covered by the prior works: System Requirements and Impact, and Limitations. In Table 2, we present these question categories, with their definitions, and example questions asked by participants. They are ordered by the frequency of being asked by participants. Categories unique to the GenAI for code are marked with a dagger (†) sign. Categories that appeared in Lim and Dey [53] but not Liao et al. [48] are marked with an asterisk (∗) sign. Below we enumerate each.\n\n# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland\n\n# Jiao Sun et al.\n\n# Category & Description\n\n|Input*|Questions about the kinds of input that the model can take or
