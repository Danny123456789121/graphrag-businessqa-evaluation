the effect on shareholder wealth is negative (wealth decreases), statistically significant (p < .001), and so substantial in size (D = -932) that the distribution of abnormal returns is shifted nearly a full standard deviation to the left (i.e., negatively) from their expected standard normal distribution. This results in a socially responsible and law-abiding manner: It also provides support for a moral position called enlightened self-interest; which prescribes that firms should act in a socially responsible manner to promote the shareholders' interests.\n\nBusiness and society scholars have spent decades wrestling with the economic assumption that people are rationally self-interested and try to maximize their personal welfare, especially in terms of monetary wealth. The problem is simple: If this is so, why would any business choose to be socially responsible, assuming that social responsibility costs a firm more than irresponsibility? Enlightened self-interested arguments for corporate.\n\n# AUTHOR'S NOTE:\n\nI would like to thank the following people for their thoughtful criticism and help along the way: Brad Agle, Mark Cordano, Michael Harwell, Tim Rowley, Alyssa Sankey, Donna Wood (the editor), the members of The University of Pittsburgh E-Group, and the three anonymous reviewers of Business & Society.\n\nBUSINESS SOCIETY, Vol. 36 No. 3, September 1997 221-249\n\n1997 Sage Publications, Inc\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014 from the SAGE Social Science Collections. All Rights Reserved.\n\n# BUSINESS SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nSocial responsibility (CSR) have focused on the long-term benefits of socially responsible behavior; benefits such as greater customer and employee loyalty, less regulation, and a more supportive external environment (e.g., Baumol, 1970; Committee for Economic Development; 1971; Steiner; 1972). Moral arguments have focused on the philosophical justifications for right behavior; with or without regard to consequences (e.g., Kant; 1785/1981; Mill, 1863/1992). Stakeholder arguments have focused on contractual and interest-based reasons for CSR (Clarkson; 1995; Evan and Freeman; 1988; Freeman; 1991). None of these positions, however, has generated convincing data in support of social responsibility. Furthermore, finance and economics research has been assumed to discount and discredit the CSR concept.\n\nIn this article, however, I show that empirical support for CSR is found in a surprising context: the finance literature based on the event study methodology. A meta-analysis of 27 event studies using CSR-related and law-related events yields the conclusion that socially irresponsible and illegal corporate acts result in substantial unrecovered decreases in shareholder wealth. This finding gives empirical weight to an enlightened self-interest argument for CSR and shows that markets do recognize and account for downstream costs (tangible and intangible) to the firm of socially irresponsible and unlawful behavior.\n\nEnlightened self-interest as a reason for corporations to act in a socially responsible and lawful manner was developed by CSR theorists, including such researchers as Baumol (1970), Wallich and McGowan (1970), Committee for Economic Development (1971), Steiner (1972), and Davis (1973). In the words of the Committee for Economic Development (1971: 27), for instance, the doctrine of enlightened self-interest calls for \"corporations to promote the public welfare in a positive way\" because this is in the long-term interest of firms and shareholders.\n\nThus, the maxim of enlightened self-interest, as defined by these theorists, could be simply stated as:\n\n- Proposition I: Firms ought to act in a socially responsible and lawful manner to increase shareholder wealth.\n\nProposition I is not a causal statement as in \"A causes B:\" It is simply a logical statement of the form \"A implies B.\" That is, if firms act in a socially responsible and lawful manner, then shareholder wealth will increase. Ultimately, the field of business and society would like to support Proposition I. Empirically, however, no consistent support has been found for the proposition that CSR and lawful behavior are a sufficient condition.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sage\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JEFF FROOMAN<|>PERSON<|>Jeff Frooman is the author of the article discussing socially irresponsible behavior and its impact on shareholder wealth, affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Pittsburgh is an educational institution where Jeff Frooman is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business Society is a journal that published the article by Jeff Frooman in September 1997.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3S INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR BUSINESS AND SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The 3S International Association for Business and Society is the organization on behalf of which the article was published.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAGE PUBLICATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sage Publications is the publisher of the Business Society journal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>EVENT<|>Social responsibility (CSR) refers to the ethical framework that suggests an entity, be it an organization or individual, has an obligation to act for the benefit of society at large.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST<|>EVENT<|>Enlightened self-interest is a moral position suggesting that acting in a socially responsible manner is in the long-term interest of firms and shareholders.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEFF FROOMAN<|>UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH<|>Jeff Frooman is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh as a faculty member or researcher<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEFF FROOMAN<|>BUSINESS SOCIETY<|>Jeff Frooman authored an article published in the Business Society journal<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESS SOCIETY<|>SAGE PUBLICATIONS<|>Business Society is published by Sage Publications<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>3S INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR BUSINESS AND SOCIETY<|>BUSINESS SOCIETY<|>The 3S International Association for Business and Society is the organization on behalf of which the Business Society journal is published<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEFF FROOMAN<|>ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST<|>Jeff Frooman discusses the concept of enlightened self-interest in relation to corporate social responsibility in his article<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<|>ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST<|>The concept of social responsibility is linked to enlightened self-interest as firms are encouraged to act responsibly for long-term benefits<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
