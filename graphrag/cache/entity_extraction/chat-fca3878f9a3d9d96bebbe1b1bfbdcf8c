To determine whether East Asian businesses similarly value CSR all the time, we used our meta-analytical tools to explore CSR’s evolutionary path in the East Asian context.

First, we systematically scanned several popular electronic databases: (1) ABI/INFORM Complete, (2) EBSCOhost, (3) Emerald, (4) Google Scholar, (5) ISI Web of Knowledge, (6) JSTOR, (7) SpringerLink, and (8) Wiley InterScience, using search keywords: corporate social responsibility, CSR, corporate social performance, corporate social responsiveness, corporate citizenship, corporate conscience, sustainable responsible business, East Asia, and performance. Second, to supplement the electronic search, we manually searched the most relevant management and business ethics journals, including Journal of Business Ethics (JBE), Academy of Management Journal (AMJ), Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS), Journal of Operations Management (JOM), Strategic Management Journal (SMJ), Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management (CSREM), Business and Society (BS), and other mainstream journals considered most highly cited in business research related to CSR topics (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992). Third, we consulted several review articles (e.g., Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Beurden & Gossling, 2008; Wood, 2010) and one meta-analysis (Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003) focusing on CSR, checked the reference lists from all pertinent literature, and traced all sources citing them using the ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar to identify any studies we might have overlooked. Finally, to gather unpublished articles and obtain meta-analysis information as completely as possible, we emailed 22 authors of relevant papers and asked for electronic drafts, correlation matrixes, and detailed information about the samples. After emailing corresponding authors, we received 12 responses in total. One author replied with the information about industry, three authors provided the information about firm size, and four authors introduced the organizational form.\n\nOur main purpose is to examine the relationship between CSR and business performance in East Asia, so we used the following inclusion criteria. First, articles should focus on the East Asian context, should draw their data from East Asia, and should use empirical methods to investigate the relationship between CSR and business performance. We excluded essays, case studies, simulation studies, or narrative reviews. Second, the literature had to offer correlation coefficient tables and sample sizes to support our meta-analysis. If not, studies should report measurement procedures and correlations’ convertible equivalents so that we could calculate the correlation coefficient with the transformation formula (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Third, we excluded studies if they measured business performance of nonprofit organizations. Prior to the meta-analysis, we coded effect size, sample size, and moderator variables (economic development, industry setting, firm size, organizational form, and measures) in all selected studies. We sorted business performance into financial performance or operational performance (see Table 1). To reduce coding error, we invited two doctoral students who are familiar with CSR literature to read all papers in the final set and code every study individually with the help of a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Coding differences are often caused by ambiguities in the coding scheme. Therefore, all different viewpoints about coding were discussed and determined before the meta-analysis began. We concentrate on developing clear and detailed coding rules when piloting our scheme. The process of coding evaluation can report the reliability on the coding of moderators and provide a check on the coding and effect size.\n\nM. Hou et al.\n\ncalculations. To evaluate the coding process, we used Cohen’s kappa for two raters. The equation for k is: k ¼ Pr a−Pr e. The inter-rater coefficient in this study is higher than 90 %, which means the reliability of our coding process is admissible. After the coding process, we found Zhang, Rezaee, and Zhu (2009) and Zhang, Zhu, Yue, and Zhu (2010) shared the same samples in their empirical studies. Therefore, we excluded Zhang et al.’s (2009) study from our database.\n\nBased on our multipronged screening process, the ultimate data of our meta-analysis contains 31,773 firm samples from 28 primary studies published from 2001 to 2015, yielding a total of 89 effect sizes\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
