The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between board independence and CSD due to the differences of country of study.\n\n[Insert Table 4]\n\n# 4.2 Board Size\n\nTable 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 = 0.1209, 95% confidence interval 0.0425; 0.1993) board size and CSD using 2228 sample sizes of 15 studies. This result is consistent with other researchers, e.g., (Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Majeed et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2014b, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar, 2010, Barakat et al., 2015). In addition, the chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 18.69) indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 80.25% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problems, no further analysis needed.\n\n# 4.3 Board Gender Diversity\n\nThe overall meta-analysis results on the association between board gender diversity and CSD are presented in Table 3. Using 2081 sample size of 9 studies provide an evidence of an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1039, 95% confidence interval -0.0820; 0.2898). Similar results find by D.Sundarasen et al. (2016), Giannarakis (2014a), Khan (2010), and Giannarakis (2014b). The chi-square statistic applies here to check the heterogeneity. The chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 28.29) is significant (p < 0.01) which means homogeneity test is rejected. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 31.82% of the observed variance. Therefore, we split the total studies into developed and developing countries to remove heterogeneity in Table 5. The studies of developed countries provide significant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0695, 95% confidence interval 0.0107; 0.1283) consistent with Deschênes et al. (2015). In contrast, the studies of developing countries indicate an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1198, 95% confidence interval -0.0940;\n\n# 4.4 Frequency of Board Meetings\n\nThe overall meta-analysis results for the frequency of board meetings of Table 3 show a mean correlation (𝑟) of 0.0399 with the 95% confidence interval between 0.0399 and 0.0399 indicates a significant positive association with CSD. The result is inconsistent with other studies. The chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 2.05) of Table 3 indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 100% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problem, no further analysis needed.\n\n# 4.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0575, 95% confidence interval -0.1865; 0.3015) between composition of non-executive directors and CSD using 1362 sample sizes of 4 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is inconsistent with other studies. The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.\n\n# 4.6 CEO Duality\n\nThe general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant negative association (𝑟 = -0.077, 95% confidence interval -0.1994; 0.0454) between CEO duality and CSD using 2130 sample sizes of 7 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. Similar result find by Razak and Mustapha (2013) and Lim et al. (2008). In addition, the chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 15.53) of Table 3 indicates the existence of heterogeneity. Therefore, the sub-group analysis (Table-6) has divided the studies into developed and developing countries. Both the studies of developed (𝑟 = -0.1092, 95% confidence interval -0.2532; 0.0348) and developing (𝑟 = -0.0654, 95% confidence interval -0.1691; 0.0383) countries indicates an insignificant negative association. The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between CEO duality and CSD due to the differences of country of study.\n\n# 4.7 Auditors’ Credibility\n\nTable 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 = 0.059, 95% confidence interval 0.059; 0.059) auditors’ credibility and CSD using 1564 sample sizes of 5 studies. This result is consistent with D.Sundarasen et al. (2016).
