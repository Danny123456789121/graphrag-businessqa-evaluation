According to this view, investment in CSR would be more wisely used, from a social perspective, on the improvement to a company’s efficiency. He further argues that every penny used in CSR activities is just spending somebody else’s money and does not do much good for the company as a whole. This theory represents the “traditionalist view.” Under this view, environmental costs used for environmental protection/improvement such as pollution abatement or air emission reduction are predicted to increase production costs and thus lower economic performance. Agency theory has been tested in several studies that examine the CSP and CFP relationship. For example, Wright and Ferris (1997) found that stock prices reacted negatively to announcements of divestment of business units in South Africa, which they interpreted as consistent with agency theory. Studies by Jaggi and Freedman (1992) and King and Lenox (2001) also find a negative relation between environmental performance and economic performance.\n\nLegitimacy theory, originated by Davis (1973), states that “society grants legitimacy and power to business. In the long run, those who do not use power in a manner which society considers responsible will tend to lose it” (Davis 1973, 314). Legitimacy theory posits that organizations are continually seeking to ensure that they operate within the bounds and norms of their respective societies (Deegan and Unerman 2006). Under legitimacy theory, corporations should be socially responsible and accountable to society in order to legally operate their business (Simnett, Vanstraelen, and Chua 2009; Dowling and Pfeffer 1975; Deegan 2002; O’Donovan 2002; de Villiers and van Staden 2006; van Staden and Hooks 2007; Cong and Freedman 2011).\n\nStakeholder theory, first proposed by Freeman (1984), provides a discussion of the links between external stakeholders and company functions. Freeman (1984) defines stakeholders as “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization objectives.” The main stakeholders are customers, employees, local communities, suppliers and distributors, the public, regulators, government, policymakers, and shareholders (Friedman and Miles 2006).\n\nBoth legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory have developed from the broader political economy perspective (Gray, Owen, and Adams 1996; Deegan 2002; Van der Laan 2009). The two concepts overlap (Gray, Kouhy, and Lavers 1995). They both focus attention on the nexus between the organization and its operating environment (Neu, Warsame, and Pedwell 1998).\n\nWhile the stakeholder approach is suggested as the best theory to explain managerial behavior, legitimacy theory deals with “perceptions and the processes” involved in the notions of power relationships (Moerman and Van Der Laan 2005).\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?\n\n# FIGURE 2\n\nTheories of the Relationship between Corporate Sustainability Performance and Corporate Financial Performance\n\n- Agency Theory\n- Traditionalist View\n- Increased operating costs\n- Decreased profitability\n- Sustainability Corporate Performance\n- Corporate Financial Performance\n- Increased positive image and decreased transaction costs\n- Increased profitability\n- Revisionist View\n- Legitimacy Theory\n- Stakeholder Theory\n\n# Literature Review and Hypothesis Development\n\n# Corporate Sustainability Performance and Corporate Financial Performance\n\nIn this section, a brief literature review is provided on the link between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. On one hand, one stream of sustainability studies has examined the association between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance. The empirical results are generally mixed. Some studies found a positive correlation between social performance and economic performance (Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Moskowitz 1972; Sturdivant and Ginter 1977), and some found a negative correlation (Vance 1975; Spicer 1978), and others found no correlation (Alexander and Buchholz 1978). On the other hand, another stream of sustainability studies has focused on the relationship between environmental performance and financial performance. One group of researchers has documented that the high environmental performance of firms increases firms’ financial performance. Another group of researchers has documented that financial performance is negatively associated with environmental performance such as pollution index.\n\nSome research on the link between environmental performance and financial performance argues that there is a conflict between the competitiveness of firms and their environmental performance (Walley and Whitehead 1994). The discussion posits that firms in industries with higher environmental compliance costs face a competitive disadvantage, because compliance costs of production activities outweigh the value added to the firm (for example, Jaggi and Freedman 1992; Blacconiere and).\n\nJournal of International Accounting Research\n\nVolume 15, Number 1, 2016\n\n# Lu and Taylor\n\nPatten 1994; Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; McPeak, Devirian, and Seaman 2010; King and Lenox 2001; Lorraine, Collison, and Power 2004; Murray, Sinclair, Power, and Gray 2006). Other researchers, however, argue that the improved environmental performance is a potential source for competitive advantage as it can lead to more efficient processes, improvements in productivity, lower costs of compliance, and new market opportunities.
