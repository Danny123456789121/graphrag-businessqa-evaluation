They must often choose between generating business value and societal value in corporate sustainability management. Companies are embedded in a dynamic form of interplay that involves economic, societal and natural systems (Hjorth and Bagheri, 2006). To deal with any emerging or prevailing antagonisms and trade-offs, decision makers need to understand the nature of the economic, environmental and social benefits and how these are related to corporate activities.\n\n20\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\n# Proposition 3f\n\nIn order to deal with trade-offs and win-lose situations that are related to economic, environmental and other social goals, decision makers need to consider both short- and long-term effects of their decisions on the company, society and natural environment.\n\n# Example 3f\n\nOne example is the difference between the investment cost of new production equipment, the total costs of ownership (TCO) and the environmental impact over the product life cycle. Sometimes, higher investments can lead to reduced TCO and environmental impacts. The question is whether decision makers are aware of the respective trade-offs involved and are willing to accept the long-term consequences.\n\nThis last proposition presents the final component in our discussion of the strategy process of corporate sustainability management. The FSSD provides support (see section 3.1) for overcoming trade-offs in win-lose situations and provides businesses with general assistance that enables them to gain a cutting-edge position in sustainability-driven markets, while achieving a balance between sustainability compliance and return on investment.\n\n# 5 Discussion and Conclusions\n\nBusinesses are central actors in any societal transition towards sustainability. However, even though concepts such as CSR, environmental management and corporate sustainability management have been subjects of discussion for many years, the advances that have been achieved are still limited. In fact, to date, only limited progress towards sustainable development has been observed.\n\nThe underlying goal of this paper was to introduce strategic management into the discussion of corporate sustainability in order to clarify various aspects related to corporate sustainability management. This should enable companies to create business and societal value through their sustainability-related activities. Arguments posed in this paper not only suggest theoretical propositions, but also provide concrete examples of how these propositions could be practically applied (see Table 4).\n\n# Table 4: Propositions for integrating strategic thinking into corporate sustainability management\n\n|Societal value of sustainable strategic management – the content dimension| |\n|---|---|\n|Proposition 1a|Integrating environmental and social issues into the content dimension|\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nof strategic management is a prerequisite to creating societal value. In order to measure the societal value of corporate sustainability management, the operationalization of sustainable development needs to be testable. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers this kind of operationalization.\n\n# Proposition 1b\n\nThe sustainability performance of an organization is based on corporate activities. The extent to which the related impacts on society and nature are considered relevant and tolerable is additionally influenced by socio-cultural and economic conditions.\n\n# Proposition 1c\n\nWhile assessing the impact of business activities, one needs to take both first- and second-order levels of sustainability into account. First-order levels are related to narrow issues of efficiency, while second-order levels are broader, and more closely related to systemic effectiveness.\n\n# Business value of sustainable strategic management – the context dimension\n\n# Proposition 2a\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a narrow sense is based on reduced costs or increased revenues. When embarking on corporate sustainability, improving public and stakeholder perceptions with regard to the legitimacy and acceptability of company activities is likely to generate economic benefits.\n\n# Proposition 2b\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased innovation.\n\n# Proposition 2c\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased market differentiation. The change from classical product-selling business models to product-service systems can significantly reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of a product.\n\n# Proposition 2d\n\nThe economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a broader sense can be based on the development of new business models.\n\n# Developing and initiating a sustainable organization – the process dimension\n\nThe organizational culture has a strong influence on the different steps necessary in the development towards a ‘sustainable organization’. The higher the level of sustainability awareness within an organization, the more ambitious the goals and strategies deployed when pursuing sustainable development.\n\n# Proposition 3a\n\nDefining short-term and long-term goals in corporate sustainability management requires the clarification of the societal and business values that will be derived.\n\n# Proposition 3b\n\nA corporate sustainability strategy matches its goals with its organizational capabilities, the organizational responsibilities of different departments and the geographical and temporal system boundaries.\n\n# Proposition 3c\n\nCorporate sustainability management should facilitate mutual learning processes to address challenges related to sustainable development. These learning processes are based on feedback loops in and among all organizational departments and management levels.\n\n22\n\n# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n\nDeveloping a sustainable organization requires the integration of issues of sustainability into the operational management level and the consideration of their relevance for all activities, routines and processes.\n\n# Proposition 3e\n\nIn order to deal with trade-offs and win-lose situations that are related to economic, environmental and other social goals, decision makers need to consider both short- and long-term effects of their decisions on the company, society and natural environment.\n\n# Proposition 3f\n\nThe lack of strategic orientation in corporate sustainability management is one major reason for lack of progress in this field. This can be offset to some extent by clarifying the respective opportunities, benefits, risks and trade-offs associated with the implementation of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate sustainability management involves integrating environmental and social issues into business strategies to create societal and business value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSSD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) provides support for overcoming trade-offs in sustainability management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Businesses are central actors in societal transitions towards sustainability, influencing economic, social, and environmental goals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sustainable organization integrates sustainability into its operational management and culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDER<|>PERSON<|>Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have an interest in the activities and outcomes of a business, particularly regarding sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECISION MAKERS<|>PERSON<|>Decision makers are individuals responsible for making strategic choices that affect corporate sustainability and its impacts on society and the environment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>BUSINESS<|>Corporate sustainability management is a key aspect of how businesses operate and transition towards sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSSD<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>The FSSD provides a framework that supports corporate sustainability management by addressing trade-offs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATION<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>A sustainable organization is a result of effective corporate sustainability management practices<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION MAKERS<|>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT<|>Decision makers play a crucial role in implementing corporate sustainability management strategies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAKEHOLDER<|>BUSINESS<|>Stakeholders influence business practices and perceptions regarding sustainability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECISION MAKERS<|>STAKEHOLDER<|>Decision makers must consider stakeholder interests when making sustainability-related decisions<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
