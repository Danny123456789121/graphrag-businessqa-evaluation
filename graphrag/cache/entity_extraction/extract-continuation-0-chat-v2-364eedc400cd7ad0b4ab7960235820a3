Some of those studies found stronger stock market reactions (in terms of magnitude of the ARs or CARs) to negative events compared to positive events (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996; Lorraine et al. 2004). Thus, there seems to be some evidence that the market punishes firms in cases of negative CEP-related events to a greater extent than it values firms in cases of positive CEP-related events. In other words, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events appear to be asymmetric.\n\nThere may be several reasons for reverse causal links between CEP and CFP. For example, firms with superior CFP may be likely to possess slack resources that allow them to invest in environmental activities (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Waddock and Graves 1997). Furthermore, also CEP related events themselves might be a trigger for causal links from CFP to CEP. For instance, negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events in time period one may initiate corporate environmental investments leading to improved CEP in time period two. (I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point).\n\nFor example, previous empirical studies have revealed moderating effects of firm size (e.g., Sharma and Henriques 2005), innovation activities (e.g., Wagner 2010), or industry characteristics (e.g., Hull and Rothenberg 2008) and mediating effects of reputation (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997), organizational culture (e.g., Surroca et al. 2010), or firm risk (e.g., Bansal and Clelland 2004).\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\nDifferent non-exclusive explanations can be offered for this phenomenon. Psychological research, in particular research on impression formation (e.g., Anderson 1981), consistently indicates that individual impressions and judgments concerning particular events or situations are inordinately influenced by more negative information than by positive information (Baumeister et al. 2001; Skowronski and Carlston 1989). That is, humans weigh negative events more heavily than positive events (Jayachandran et al. 2013; Lankoski 2009). This pattern, denoted as negativity bias or positive–negative asymmetry effect, has been recognized and repeatedly confirmed in several research domains (Baumeister et al. 2001); for example, for the voting behavior in research in political science (e.g., Aragones 1997), for media attention in communication studies (e.g., Shoemaker et al. 1991), or for memorization processes in cognitive psychology scholarship (e.g., Robinson-Riegler and Winton 1996). In the field of economic psychology prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) it is highlighted that individual decision-making patterns imply that greater weight is accorded to costs than to gains. By means of experiments Kahneman and Tversky (1979) revealed that people care more strongly about a loss in utility than they do about a gain of equal magnitude (Soroka 2006). A study of Sen and Bhattacharya (2001) indicated that positive–negative asymmetries might also be relevant in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In particular, they found that consumers’ company evaluations were more sensitive to negative CSR information than positive information. Similarly, Lankoski (2009), drawing on data from an executive survey, showed that corporate responsibility issues that reduce negative externalities entail stronger economic impacts than those that generate positive externalities.\n\nAnother explanation has been put forward by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). They pointed to the fact that negative events such as environmental crises entail financial implications more obviously than positive CEP-related events. Thus, such events in addition to signaling poor CEP also forward information with manifested financial implications compared to positive events such as announcements of environmental awards.\n\nFinally, preannouncement information asymmetry effects might explain asymmetric stock market reactions. Doh et al. (2010), examining the stock market reaction to the inclusion in or the deletion from the Calvert Social Index, found significant ARs for deletions from the index but no significant ARs for additions. They argued that information asymmetries prior to the announcement of additions and deletions might explain this difference. While firms with superior CSP would be likely to publicize pertinent information, firms with deteriorating CSP would tend to withhold such information. Thus, announcements of addition to, or deletion from, a social responsibility\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CFP<|>EVENT<|>CFP refers to Corporate Financial Performance, which is analyzed in relation to Corporate Environmental Performance (CEP) in various studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEP<|>EVENT<|>CEP stands for Corporate Environmental Performance, which is evaluated in the context of its impact on Corporate Financial Performance (CFP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Dixon-Fowler et al. are researchers who contributed to the understanding of the relationship between CEP and CFP in their studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSO AND MINTO<|>PERSON<|>Russo and Minto are researchers who have explored the factors affecting the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGOLIS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Margolis et al. conducted research that discusses the precision of event studies in analyzing stock price reactions to news announcements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSOLANDI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Consolandi et al. are researchers who have examined stock market reactions to CEP-related events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KLASSEN AND MCLAUGHLIN<|>PERSON<|>Klassen and McLaughlin are researchers who studied the stock market reactions to both positive and negative CEP-related events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORENCE ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Lorraine et al. are researchers who have contributed to the understanding of stock market reactions to CEP-related events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARMA AND HENRIQUES<|>PERSON<|>Sharma and Henriques are researchers who have revealed moderating effects of firm size on the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAGNER<|>PERSON<|>Wagner is a researcher who has studied the impact of innovation activities on the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HULL AND ROTHENBERG<|>PERSON<|>Hull and Rothenberg are researchers who have examined industry characteristics affecting the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSO AND FOUTS<|>PERSON<|>Russo and Fouts are researchers who have explored the mediating effects of reputation on the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURROCA ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Surroca et al. are researchers who have studied the impact of organizational culture on the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANSAL AND CLELLAND<|>PERSON<|>Bansal and Clelland are researchers who have examined the effects of firm risk on the relationship between CEP and CFP.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>RUSSO AND MINTO<|>Dixon-Fowler et al. and Russo and Minto both contributed to the research on the relationship between CEP and CFP<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGOLIS ET AL.<|>DIXON-FOWLER ET AL.<|>Margolis et al. reference the work of Dixon-Fowler et al. in their analysis of event studies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONSOLANDI ET AL.<|>KLASSEN AND MCLAUGHLIN<|>Both Consolandi et al. and Klassen and McLaughlin studied stock market reactions to CEP-related events<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARMA AND HENRIQUES<|>KLASSEN AND MCLAUGHLIN<|>Sharma and Henriques' research on firm size moderating effects relates to Klassen and McLaughlin's findings on stock market reactions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HULL AND ROTHENBERG<|>KLASSEN AND MCLAUGHLIN<|>Hull and Rothenberg's examination of industry characteristics complements Klassen and McLaughlin's work on stock market reactions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSO AND FOUTS<|>SHARMA AND HENRIQUES<|>Russo and Fouts' research on reputation mediating effects relates to Sharma and Henriques' findings on firm size<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURROCA ET AL.<|>BANSAL AND CLELLAND<|>Surroca et al. and Bansal and Clelland both explore factors affecting the relationship between CEP and CFP<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
