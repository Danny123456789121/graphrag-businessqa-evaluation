Furthermore, from 1995 to 2012, the size of the US SRI market, measured in total.\n\nIn cases of sample periods involving years before and after the year 2000, the studies were coded according to the main emphasis of the sample period.\n\nJ. Endrikat\n\nassets under professional management, increased by 486 % (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment 2012). Given the significantly increased relevance of environmental issues, it is likely that the stock market reactions to CEP-related events have changed since the 1990s. The year 2000 was chosen for splitting the samples because the DJSIs, the first global sustainability equity indexes, were launched in September 1999.\n\nThird, the sample was divided according to whether the study explicitly mentioned that it accounted for confounding events or whether the study failed to do so. According to McWilliams and Siegel (1997), confounding events constitute the most critical issue with regard to the event study methodology. Confounding events are firm-specific events, other than the focal event, that occur during the event window and might have an impact on the firm’s stock price. Such events can include dividend declarations, announcements of an impending merger, signings of major contracts, announcements of new products, filings of large damage suits, announcements of unexpected earnings, or changes with regard to key executive positions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Concerns regarding confounding events can be addressed by screening for potentially confounding events and excluding the relevant observations from the analysis.\n\nFinally, this work distinguished between effect sizes derived from ARs and effect sizes derived from CARs. ARs represent the difference between expected returns and actual returns, or in other words, returns earned by firms adjusted for the “normal” return process (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). ARs are usually measured on day zero (i.e., the date of the respective event) or on day 1 (i.e., the day following the respective event). CARs are calculated by cumulating ARs over a certain period of time, the so-called event window. Thus, CARs are assumed to measure the average effect of an event on the firm’s stock price (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). However, the use of CARs may exacerbate the problem of confounding events, especially if long event windows are used (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Furthermore, with regard to effect sizes calculated from CARs, this work distinguished between CARs calculated over the traditional 3-day event window (-1, 1) and CARs calculated over longer event windows.\n\nA common issue regarding the meta-analytic methodology is manifested by the so-called publication bias or file-drawer problem. The file-drawer problem rests on the assumption that the decision for submitting or publishing studies is influenced by the presence or absence of statistically significant results in such a way that statistically non-significant findings are less likely to be published (Begg 1994; Dalton et al. 2012; Geyskens et al. 2009).\n\nConsequently, meta-analytic calculations may yield upwardly biased results. To account for the file-drawer problem, I calculated the fail–safe k, which provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to make the summary effect insignificantly (Rosenthal 1979).\n\n# Results\n\n|Table 2 reports the results of the separate meta-analyses.|Table 2 reports the results of the separate meta-analyses.|\n|---|\n|Hypotheses|Results|\n|1a: Positive stock market reactions to positive CEP-related events|Supported, r = .064 (95 % CI: .017 to –.111)|\n|1b: Negative stock market reactions to negative events|Supported, r = -.180 (95 % CI: -.238 to -.120)|\n|Publication Bias|99 additional null-effect studies needed for positive events; 1035 for negative events|\n|Moderation Effects|Significant moderation effect found for length of event windows|\n|Positive Events (3-day window)|r = .120 (95 % CI: .047 to –.192)|\n|Positive Events (longer windows)|r = .008 (95 % CI: -.069 to –.084)|\n|Negative Events (3-day window)|r = -.294 (p < .01)|\n|Negative Events (longer windows)|r = -.109 (95 % CI: -.175 to -.041)|\n\nWith regard to the other subgroup analyses, no statistically significant moderation effects were found. However, for proofing that the difference was statistically significant, I conducted an additional meta-analysis including both effect sizes for positive and negative events as separate subgroups whereby the sign of the effect sizes for negative events has been reversed. The QB indicated a significant difference (QB = 200.360, p < .01).\n\n# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events\n\n# Table 2 Meta-analytic results\n\n|Sample|K|N|Estimated population r|95 % CI|p|Q|Moderation indicated| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Positive CEP-related events|Overall|33|5085|.064***|.017|.111|.007|61.586***|\n|US samples|21|4011|.053**|.001|.106|.049|41.092***|No|\n|Non-US samples|12|1074|.092**|.008|.175|.031|17.265| |\n|Events before the year 2000|13|\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
