Similarly, the benefits of stakeholder reciprocation may become manifest in different guises, including retention, word of mouth, and commitment, which all require further empirical measurement.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

As more empirical research fleshing out these four mechanisms accumulates, however, we expect the explanatory power of each of these mechanisms to strengthen further.\n\nresearch has not yet unveiled all empirical mechanisms through which CSR may contribute to CFP. There may be other mechanisms at play than the four that we identified in this study, implying that our definition of Strategic CSR may need to be expanded and adjusted. As observed above, this is consistent with a causal approach to explanatory concepts in social science, in which new empirical knowledge about a phenomenon may require adjustments or expansions in its conceptual definition (Goertz, 2006).\n\nUsing meta-analysis to investigate our research question is one of the strengths of our paper, but it also has limitations. While our conceptualization of Strategic CSR assumes that the empirical mechanisms that we document involve causal relationships, meta-analysis is not the best method for identifying causality in empirical research. Rather, meta-analysis is more suited for investigating which theoretical views about causal relationships are supported by a preponderance of the available evidence. The growing and increasingly fragmented nature of existing CSR-CFP research makes such an assessment of the literature imperative. By identifying the four causally most relevant empirical mechanisms underlying the CSR-CFP relationship, our study may therefore constitute a counter-force to further fragmentation of the field, and provide guidance to researchers seeking to address ever finer-grained research questions in order to identify causality through their research designs.\n\nA related limitation of meta-analysis is that the effect sizes that can be included as data depend on their availability in primary studies. Because available empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship is highly diverse, we were able to incorporate many effect sizes and empirically test finer-grained models than have been meta-analytically tested to date.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nwe could not address any questions for which effect sizes were not or insufficiently available in primary studies. This problem is most pressing with respect to the measurement of CSR itself, which prior research has often operationalized by using overly inclusive indicators that lump together many different phenomena (Chatterji, Durand, Levine, & Touboul, 2016; Gond & Crane, 2010; Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008; Rowley & Berman, 2000). If anything, we urge researchers to use more specific measurements of Strategic CSR, derived from the empirical mechanisms that are or have been investigated (or, to say the same in other words: to adopt level 3 indicators that derive from secondary level mechanisms, as illustrated in Figure 2).\n\nFinally, we acknowledge that our study offers conceptual clarification on the part of the CSR concept that has strategic value for the firm. As a result, our study says very little about CSR that does not benefit the firm financially. Some scholars have explicitly argued that managers should only engage in CSR if it simultaneously advances the bottom line (Jensen, 2002; Waldman & Siegel, 2008). We do not agree, however, that all CSR is or ought to be strategic. Some CSR activities may have a neutral or insignificant impact on CFP, while others may have a significant negative effect, at least in the short to medium term (Wright & Ferris, 1997). Our meta-analysis did not touch upon the non-strategic side of the CSR concept as this has mostly been a blind spot to CSR scholars.\n\nTo understand and conceptualize non-strategic CSR, empirical research is needed that explores when and why managers sometimes pursue CSR activities that are not directly financially beneficial to the firm. Do such activities only serve managerial self-interests (Jensen, 2002; Waldman & Siegel, 2008), or are managers driven by more altruistic motives (Husted & Salazar, 2006)? Moreover, under what conditions do a firm’s stakeholders, especially its shareholders, accept non-strategic forms of CSR? This will likely depend on the consequences of non-strategic CSR, not only for the firm, but also for society. The literature currently defines CSR as all.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

As the value of CSR\n\nshould not be evaluated on the basis of its strategic benefits for the firm alone, we hope that\n\nthe next of wave of CSR research will focus more on empirically investigating the field-\n\ndefining assumption that CSR furthers some form of social good and thereby increase our\n\nunderstanding of non-strategic forms of CSR.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.
