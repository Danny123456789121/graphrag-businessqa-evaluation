Therefore, we conjecture that researchers in academia tend to find a smaller performance difference between SRI and conventional groups than industry professionals. In order to test this argument, we propose the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 4-1.\n\nThe AESs obtained by academic researchers will be smaller than those obtained by industry researchers.\n\nIt is possible that researchers in different disciplines may have different perspectives on SRI and this will lead to a systematic difference in their research outcomes. For example, researchers in the finance area may focus more on profit maximization and argue against the benefit of SRI, while researchers in other areas such as business ethics may think social benefits are more important than monetary benefits, advocating for SRI. To examine the impact of a difference in researcher perspectives on ESs, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 4-2.\n\nThe ESs of papers published in finance journals will be smaller than those published in non-finance journals.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\n# 2.2.4. Control group.\n\nResearchers compare the performance of SRI funds and portfolios with the performance of various control groups. For example, Muñoz et al. (2015) compare SRI mutual funds with conventional mutual funds, while Edmans (2011) compares SRI portfolios with market indexes. In general, the difference between SRI portfolios and market indexes is higher than that between SRI portfolios and corresponding conventional portfolios. Whereas SRI portfolios suffer from diversification loss due to screening procedures, market indexes do not. On the other hand, conventional portfolios are formed by an author(s) considering comparability with SRI portfolios. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 5-1.\n\nThe comparison between SRI portfolios and market indexes will have larger AESs than the comparison between SRI and conventional portfolios.\n\nFor the papers that use conventional market indexes as the control group, the treatment groups are either SRI portfolios or SRI indexes (Statman, 2006). In this case, the discrepancy between the two indexes, i.e., SRI and conventional, is smaller than that between SRI portfolios and conventional indexes. For example, the Domini Social Index is a leading market capitalization-weighted SRI index. It was created in 1990 by starting with the companies in the S&P 500 index, so many companies are included in both indexes (Di Bartolomeo and Kurtz, 1999; Brander, 2006). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 5-2.\n\nThe AESs will be smaller when SRI indexes rather than SRI portfolios are compared with conventional indexes.\n\nSocially responsible investment portfolios have a less favorable risk–return trade-off due to diversification loss (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Statman and Glushkov, 2009). When market portfolios are used rather than conventional portfolios composed by researchers as a control group, the degree of diversification loss is relatively larger. This leads to the following hypothesis regarding ESs themselves.\n\n# Hypothesis 5-3.\n\nExperiments using market index as a control group will have smaller ESs than those using conventional portfolios as a control group.\n\n# 2.2.5. Investment universe.\n\nCultural elements are important in studying the impact of SRI (Hill et al., 2007; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). Since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006), SRI funds can appeal more strongly to regions with a similar cultural background than to other countries with different cultural backgrounds. Indeed, Jones et al. (2008) find that SRI funds with a high exposure to international capital markets underperform the market by 3% per annum. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# C.-S. Kim\n\n# Hypothesis 6.\n\nThe performance of domestic SRI funds will be better than international SRI funds.\n\n# 2.2.6. Screening procedure.\n\nFunds using negative screening exclude unethical firms, and sometimes even entire industries, from their portfolios, causing a sharp shrink in the portfolio frontier. Moreover, since sin stocks seem to perform better, SRI based on negative screening will result in a worse performance than conventional investment (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). This problem is less severe in the case of positive screening, since fund managers can add SR stocks to their existing portfolios. Even when SRI managers select stocks purely based on positive criteria, they may perform better than broadly diversifying fund managers since they may have an intimate knowledge of SR stocks (Kacperczyk et al., 2005; Girard et al., 2007). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 7.\n\nFunds employing a positive screening procedure will outperform those with a negative screening procedure.\n\n# 2.2.7. Mutual funds.\n\nIn existing literature, many authors study the performance of SRI mutual funds (Geczy et al., 2005; Chang and Witte, 2010; Climent and Soriano, 2011; Muñoz et al., 2014), while others study SRI portfolios formed by themselves (Diltz, 1995; Gompers et al., 2003; Core et al., 2006). There can be differences between the two types of research since it is well known that managed funds rarely beat the market (Jensen, 1968; Ferson and Schadt, 1996; Ferson and Warther, 1996\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN SECURITIES ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Korean Securities Association is an organization that published a meta-analysis on socially responsible investment (SRI) and its performance compared to conventional investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C.-S.
