Part of this limitation will be due to their limited cognitive capacities to handle large amounts of information (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). However, the availability of additional time and resources will allow these managers to collect more detailed information on the broad range of sustainability issues they have noticed. We therefore suggest the following relation between resource availability and scanning (see the dotted curve in Figure 2).\n\n# Proposition 3\n\nThe availability of additional time and resources will enable decision makers with a paradoxical frame to scan in more detail but will not increase the breadth of scanning of decision makers with a business case frame.\n\n# Interpreting\n\n“Interpretation is the act of carving out meaning from ambiguous cues and is the very core of the sensemaking process” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178). As research on strategic issue diagnosis suggests (Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993), managers interpret strategic issues by assessing different aspects of those issues against the categories of their cognitive frames. Individuals with different cognitive frames will attach different labels to information in order to understand it and will interpret information differently (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). Accordingly, we expect that decision makers with a business case frame will interpret the ambiguities of sustainability issues differently from decision makers with a paradoxical frame.\n\nManagers commonly interpret strategic issues in terms of two dimensions: sense of control over the issue and valence of the issue—that is, their evaluation of the issue as positive or negative (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Plambeck & Weber, 2010). The perceived sense of control reflects the extent to which a manager believes “in his or her ability to effect a change, in a desired direction” (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986: 165). Sense of control is neither a stable personality trait, since it can change over time and differ according to the issue or situation at hand, nor is it objective (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986). Rather, it represents a subjective perception and may even be an illusion (Langer, 1975). With regard to the valence of an issue, in previous work on strategic issue diagnosis, researchers tended to assume that decision makers usually classify an issue as either positive or negative (Chattopadhyay, Glick, & Huber, 2001; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; George, Chattopadhyay, Sitkin, & Barden, 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Sharma, 2000; Thomas et al., 1993). More recently, how-\n\n2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 473\n\never, organizational scholars have devoted attention to ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues (Fong, 2006; Gilbert, 2006; Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). While univalent interpretations denote an issue as being clearly positive or negative, ambivalent interpretations attach competing positive and negative evaluations to various aspects of an issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010).\n\nWe argue that managers’ cognitive frames will play an important role in their perceived sense of control and valence of sustainability issues. Their perceived sense of control depends on what information is available to them (Thomas et al., 1993) and how that information is collected (Das & Teng, 1999). “High levels of information use among top managers will be positively related to their interpretation of strategic issues as controllable” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243). Moreover, the more managers believe they understand cause-and-effect relationships between different aspects of an issue, the higher their sense of control will be (Sharma et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 1993).\n\nWith their frame content focused on economic attributes and frame structure based on an alignment logic, managers with a business case frame will have the clear goal of identifying and gaining a detailed understanding of sustainability issues that contribute to economic objectives. Consequently, we expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they have noticed. The sense of control will be heightened by their highly structured and formalized search and assessment routines, which have a clear problem focus (Das & Teng, 1999).\n\nSince they will systematically probe into how sustainability issues relate to financial performance, they will tend to be confident about their ability to understand the nature of this cause-and-effect relationship. As an example, Royal Dutch/Shell managers defended their plans for oil drilling in the Arctic against criticism from environmental NGOs and competitors by highlighting their positive evaluation in terms of business opportunities and their ability to control potential spills. Through a spokesperson, Shell’s top managers argued that “at Shell, we believe the Arctic has significant untapped potential and will play an increasingly important role in meeting the energy challenge” and emphasized their sense of control by stating that “our experience working in rigorous and challenging conditions in the Arctic means that we are qualified to do the job right—to explore for offshore oil and gas in Alaska in a very safe and careful way” (The Guardian, 2012: 35).\n\nBased on “a feeling that no stone has been left unturned” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243), they will have a high sense of mastery and control over sustainability issues.\n\nDecision makers assess issue valence by evaluating those aspects of an issue they have noticed against the categories of their cognitive frame (Petty, Briñol, & DeMarree, 2007). Rudolph and Popp (2007) found that individuals with strong directional goals tend to interpret issues univalently—that is, as either\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
