However, this is not sufficient. It is also necessary to investigate the existence of selection and specification effects.\n\nThe association between genuine and observed partial correlations can be expressed as:\n\nr0 = f(rg, S, p, u)\n\nwhere rg denotes the genuine partial correlation between CSP and financial performance, S is the systematic specification impact, p denotes publication bias, and u represents random specification differences.\n\nThe observed partial correlation r0 is not observed and must be inferred from the available literature. However, it is well known that study outcomes potentially distort the estimates of rg based on the population of published studies. Meta-regression analysis can be used to identify the impact\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAIGNAN, FERRELL & HULT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maignan, Ferrell & Hult is a research group that published a study in 1999 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OGDEN & WATSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ogden & Watson is a research group that published a study in 1999 in the UK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARTER; KALE & GRIMM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carter; Kale & Grimm is a research group that published a study in 2000 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTMANN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Christmann is a researcher who published a study in 2000 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOWELL, HART & YEUNG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dowell, Hart & Yeung is a research group that published a study in 2000 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARAGOZOGLU & LINDELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Karagozoglu & Lindell is a research group that published a study in 2000 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCWILLIAMS & SIEGEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McWilliams & Siegel is a research group that published a study in 2000 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAVES & WADDOCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Graves & Waddock is a research group that published a study in 2000 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HILLMAN & KEIM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hillman & Keim is a research group that published a study in 2001 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moore is a researcher who published a study in 2001 in the UK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUF; MURALIDHAR; BROWN, JANNEY & PAUL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ruf; Muralidhar; Brown, Janney & Paul is a research group that published a study in 2001 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPSON & KOHER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simpson & Koher is a research group that published a study in 2002 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOORE & ROBSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moore & Robson is a research group that published a study in 2002 in the UK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEIFERT, MORRIS & BARTKUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Seifert, Morris & Bartkus is a research group that published a study in 2003 in the USA.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIGNAN, FERRELL & HULT<|>OGDEN & WATSON<|>Both organizations published studies in the same year, 1999, indicating a potential collaboration or shared research interests<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARTER; KALE & GRIMM<|>DOWELL, HART & YEUNG<|>Both organizations published studies in the year 2000, suggesting they may be part of the same research community<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARAGOZOGLU & LINDELL<|>MCWILLIAMS & SIEGEL<|>Both organizations published studies in the year 2000, indicating a possible connection in research focus<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAVES & WADDOCK<|>HILLMAN & KEIM<|>Both organizations published studies in the year 2001, suggesting they may be addressing similar research questions<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOORE<|>MOORE & ROBSON<|>Both entities are associated with the name Moore and published studies in the same year, indicating a potential link<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMPSON & KOHER<|>SEIFERT, MORRIS & BARTKUS<|>Both organizations published studies in the year 2002 and 2003 respectively, indicating they may be part of the same research field<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
