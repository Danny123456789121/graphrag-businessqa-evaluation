Statistical significance is assessed by plotting rolling p-values of the alpha based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. Figure 3 identifies the exact timing of when the dirty-minus-clean portfolio delivers a high and significant alpha. The shaded area in the figure corresponds to the critical sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. The figure reveals that the alpha is high and significant only during this sample period but not immediately before or after. To be more specific, the figure suggests that the good performance of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio:\n\n- (i) begins around November 2003, which is more than a year before the implementation of Phase I in January 2005;\n- (ii) it then continues during all of Phase I (2005-2008);\n- (iii) it diminishes in the first year of Phase II (2008); and\n- (iv) it disappears afterwards.\n\nThese results are further illustrated in Table 3. Specifically, the carbon premium relative to the CAPM is 16.8% and highly significant for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, but falls to 2.9% and becomes insignificant when the sample period extends to the end of Phase II in December 2012. It is also interesting to note that in Phase I (2005-2007) the carbon premium is 15.3% and significant, whereas in Phase II (2008-2012) it is 8.2% and insignificant. The results are similar using the FF3 and FF4 factor models.\n\nOverall, this evidence suggests that the carbon premium is present for the period that the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting firms will be receiving allowances for free. This is because:\n\n- (i) the appearance of the carbon premium coincides with the passing of the EU law establishing the ETS with free allocation of allowances; and\n- (ii) the disappearance of the carbon premium coincides with the passing of an EU law stipulating that allowances will be mainly sold in auctions beginning in 2013.\n\nIt is therefore likely that the carbon premium may have been a one-off event, which was only present during this particular period as it was.\n\n14\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\ndriven by the free allocation of carbon allowances and lasted for as long as the law stipulated the allocation will be free.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of a high and significant carbon premium over the sample period identified in Figure 3 is a new and important result. This finding strongly supports the first testing hypothesis (H1) implied by the economic mechanism discussed in Section 3. A high and significant carbon premium confirms empirically that carbon emitting firms are substantially overcompensated by receiving free carbon emission allowances as indicated by the theoretical work of Demailly and Quirion (2009) and Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) among others. In this context, our analysis contributes to the current environmental policy debate because, in addition to helping us understand the workings of the EU ETS, it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade environmental regulation implemented elsewhere.\n\n# 7 The Price of Carbon Risk\n\nThis section evaluates the effect of carbon risk on the cross-section of expected stock returns. Our empirical analysis is based on Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. In line with standard practice in asset pricing, we proxy carbon risk by the “dirty-minus-clean” (DMC) risk factor. This is a zero-investment portfolio defined as the expected return on the equally weighted portfolio of the eight dirty stocks minus the expected return on the equally weighted portfolio of the 41 clean stocks. Note that the DMC factor is the expected return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio, whereas the carbon premium is the alpha of the same portfolio.\n\nWe implement the Fama and MacBeth (1973) procedure in the standard two stages. First, we use time-series regressions to estimate the betas on the CAPM, the three-factor Fama-French (1993) model and the four-factor Carhart (1997) model, while adding the DMC factor to all these specifications. In the second stage, we implement a cross-sectional regression of the average returns of all 65 stocks on their betas. The slopes of the cross-sectional regression deliver the price of risk for each factor.\n\nFor robustness, in addition to the standard four factors we also specify an industry factor as well as a series of other factors recently proposed in the asset pricing literature. The industry factor (IND) is generated by grouping the 65 stocks in 10 industry portfolios using the Fama-French industry definitions. Then, we estimate the beta of each stock on the excess return to the equally weighted industry portfolio it belongs to, while also conditioning on\n\n15\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497\n\nthe excess return of the market. We use the industry betas as an independent variable in the cross-sectional regressions and we report the price of risk. This captures the cross-sectional variation of the sensitivity to the industry factor.\n\nWe also use six additional control variables, which are specified as follows: (i) MAX is the Bali, Cakici and Whitelaw (2011) measure of the maximum daily return within a month for each stock; (ii) ILLIQ is the Amihud (2002) measure of stock illiquidity for each stock defined as the ratio of the absolute stock return to its dollar trading volume. As with the standard factors, we estimate the beta of each stock on MAX and ILLIQ separately, and then use these betas in the cross-sectional regressions; (iii) IV\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
