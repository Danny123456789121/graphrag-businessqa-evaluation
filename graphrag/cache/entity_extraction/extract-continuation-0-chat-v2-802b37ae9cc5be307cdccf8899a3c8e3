Meta-analysis treats the results of each study it examines as a single data point. Because this article examines 27 event studies that have used incidences of socially responsible events...\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\ndata points. The technique of meta-analysis dates back as far as the 1930s, but it was not until the 1980s that social science researchers (e.g-, Glass, Jackson, 1982) began to refine the statistical techniques for their uses. The most up-to-date work on meta-analysis can be found in the edited volume by Cooper and Hedges (1994), which includes the approach to meta-procedures include a technique for meta-analyzing multilevel independent variables (Nouri and Greenberg, 1995), a technique for identifying outliers in data sets comprising correlation coefficients (Huffcutt and Arthur; 1995), and a technique for comparing the results of two meta-analyses using independent data sets (Alliger; 1995).\n\nBy meta-analyzing the results of event studies using socially irresponsible and illegal actions as their events, this article significantly extends the work of Arlow and Gannon (1982) and Ullmann (1985). This article is the first to collect event studies involving socially irresponsible and illegal behavior and the first to meta-analyze their results. It finds that; together, the 27 event studies produce a statistically significant result, indicating that substantial losses accrue to the shareholders of irresponsible and unlawful firms. In short; the wealth of shareholders does decrease when companies engage in socially irresponsible and illegal behavior;\n\n# THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF A FIRM'S BEHAVIOR ON ITS STOCK PRICE\n\nAlthough event studies may gauge the market's reaction only during the few days preceding and following reports of some action taken by a firm; the effect of the market's reaction to an event is not short-term in nature. Financial economists believe that any action taken by a firm permanently affects the value of that firm's stock (Brealey and Myers, 1996; Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe, 1996).\n\nRecall that share prices reflect the opinion of market participants regarding a firm's future cash flows. If participants believe that the future cash flows of a firm will decrease due to some behavior of the firm; demand for the stock will decrease, thus lowering the value of the stock. Later; if they believe that future cash flows will increase due to some new behavior of the firm; demand for the stock will increase, and this increased demand will drive up the value of the stock.\n\nBut the resulting final value\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# BUSINESS & SOCIETY\n\n# September 1997\n\nof the stock will not be as high as it would have been if the stock had not lost value previously. Consider this simplified example: Initially (time t), market participants determine that the stock of firm F is worth $80 a share. (That is, the discounted value of the future cash flows divided by the number of outstanding shares equals $80.) The firm engages in some action A at time t1, and market participants conclude the action will decrease future cash flows by 10%. When they recalculate share price based on these lower future cash flows, they find that F should only sell for $72, that is, 80 (80 x 10%) = 72 per share. (A stable discount rate is assumed throughout this example.) If a rough consensus for F is that it is overpriced, then drops to around $72. (Abnormal demand for F declines, and its price negative returns will be recorded during this drop.) Some time later; at time t2, F engages in some action B. Market participants believe this action will increase F's future cash flows by 15%. The participants recalculate share price and find that firm F should sell for $82.80, that is, 72 (72 x 15%) = 82.80 per share. We would now expect to see positive abnormal returns on F as its stock climbs to around $82.80. Firm F's shares would have been worth $92, that is, 80 + (80 x 15%) = 92. The point, then, is that if F had not committed action A at t1 then at t2, firm F's stock will be worth less than it would have been if F had not taken the action A at t1.\n\n# METHODOLOGY\n\nBecause this article is not an event study but rather a meta-analysis of the article. First, there is an explanation of how the articles meta-analyzed in this article were selected, and then there is a description of which data were used from them: Finally, there is a review of the actual statistical tests that were applied to the data. An explanation of event study methodology appears in the Appendix:\n\n# Selection of Studies\n\nThe following two subsections are concerned, respectively, with two issues: (a) the method used for finding event studies for possible inclusion in this meta-analysis sample and (b) the definition of a CSR event and how it was used to establish inclusion/exclusion criteria for the sample.\n\nDownloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014\n\n# Frooman META-ANALYSIS\n\nThe 27 studies ultimately selected and meta-analyzed in this article are summarized in Table 1.\n\nSearch procedure.
