New customers and markets could be reached because of the reduced costs, making healthcare cheaper and more accessible by automating, for example, pre-screening or AI-conducted pre-diagnosis (Greymatter 2023b). In addition, new customer relationships might be formed with more autonomous and informed patients, who can monitor their own condition better and provide valuable feedback and actual data (e.g., with smart wearables combined), thus enhancing the therapy’s success.\n\n# 5.2.2.3 Value capture innovation\n\nIncreasing numbers of pay-per-session and subscription-based models have appeared in recent years (e.g., Stanford therapy chatbot or Woebot Health). AI-powered mental health solutions will most likely decrease costs drastically and thereby enable a broader patient group to access the services. A freemium model is imaginable in which some services and assistance, for example via chat, are free, whereas consultations with a human doctor are charged. Value cost structure can be impacted through efficiency gains, reduced overheads, more automation, and the outsourcing of repetitive tasks, meaning that human doctors can shift their focus towards value-adding tasks. In addition, the extended, potentially global reach allows for an unprecedented scalability of services. So, what should we expect? Mental health chatbots, increasingly popular and smart, will most likely provide a discreet, convenient avenue for addressing mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, or stress in the future to a growing target group who require assistance.\n\n# 5.2.3 Case study #3 financial services (investment management)\n\nGAI has the potential to impact investment management through data analysis, risk assessment, and decision-making (Ko and Lee 2023). By employing sophisticated algorithms to process vast amounts of financial data, GAI could identify patterns, predict market trends, and uncover investment prospects. This would ultimately enhance investment strategies, optimize returns, automate due diligence, and improve portfolio performance (Daugherty et al. 2023).\n\n# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…\n\nGAI could help with fraud detection as well as customer-facing tasks such as personalized financial advice in wealth management, for example (Schmidt and Albright 2023). It appears that change is already happening, with new tools such as the IPO prediction software developed by PitchBook (Wiggers 2023); the “ChatGPT of finance,” Finchat; or the launch of Bloomberg’s own 50-billion parameter large language model (Bloomberg 2023). Another example is GPTQuant, a conversational AI chatbot for developing and evaluating investment strategies (Yue and Au 2023). Initial harbingers can be seen in the surge of job postings related to AI in the financial sector: Stanford’s AI Index Report (Maslej 2023) places the AI job postings in the finance industry as the third highest out of all industries. Nonetheless, in an industry where trust is crucial and that is traditionally not an early adopter (Hinkfuss 2023), it is especially necessary to ensure the safe, reliable, and compliant usage of GAI (Lau 2023).\n\n# 5.2.3.1 Value creation innovation\n\nEnhanced new capabilities, such as AI-driven analytics, could enable firms to uncover patterns and predict market trends, leading to more informed investment decisions. Improved risk assessment through AI-generated insights could support decision-making, whereas AI-driven research could enable better due diligence and risk minimization, ultimately leading to improved work efficiency and reduced working time of analysts (Daugherty et al. 2023). New technologies and equipment integration is also a new reality with the strong interconnection of hardware and AI, as demonstrated by the news that Bloomberg has integrated AI into its famous terminal (Sheikh 2023). New partnerships with AI technology companies could provide direct access to cutting-edge tools, while collaborations with data providers ensure access to financial information. Engaging with regulatory institutions is thereby crucial to guaranteeing that AI-driven investment practices are compliant. Following this hypothesis, new processes would be required to facilitate the adoption of AI in due diligence, risk assessment, and portfolio building. These processes, resulting from new capabilities, can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of investment strategies.\n\n# 5.2.3.2 New proposition innovation\n\nNew offerings could arise in the form of integrating AI into investment products, leveraging AI-generated insights, or using predictions to optimize returns. AI-powered trading algorithms could analyze and act upon real-time market data, enabling high-frequency and automated trading. Moreover, GAI can be used to detect fraudulent financial transactions by identifying patterns previously hidden to human inspection (Hinkfuss 2023). This can assist financial institutions in identifying and preventing fraudulent activity. Due to the automation of tasks, new customers and new markets could be addressed with the reshaping of cost structures. Personalized investment and wealth management could be offered to a wider audience—not only would high-net-worth individuals have access, but everyone could profit from AI-driven financial planning based on insights into their preferences, financial situation, and needs. As a result of this, the new channels to offer robo-advisory services could potentially be digital—for example, in the form of apps and online platforms. Lastly, all these\n\n# 5.2.3.3 Value capture innovation\n\nNew, or rather slightly altered, revenue models could be envisioned in the form of performance-based fees, contingent on achieving specific benchmarks, thus incentivizing investment managers to leverage AI to maximize client returns. Freemium models could expand the customer base by providing basic AI-driven investment tools free of charge\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GREYMATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Greymatter is an organization that provides insights into the impact of AI on mental health and healthcare services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANFORD THERAPY CHATBOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stanford therapy chatbot is an AI-powered mental health solution that offers therapy sessions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOEBOT HEALTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Woebot Health is a company that provides AI-driven mental health support through chatbots.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GAI refers to Generative Artificial Intelligence, which is being utilized in various sectors including investment management and mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PITCHBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PitchBook is a financial data and software company that developed IPO prediction software.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOMBERG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bloomberg is a global financial services company that has integrated AI into its terminal and launched a large language model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPTQUANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPTQuant is a conversational AI chatbot designed for developing and evaluating investment strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANFORD AI INDEX REPORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stanford's AI Index Report provides insights into job postings related to AI across various industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HINKFUSS<|>PERSON<|>Hinkfuss is an expert discussing the implications of AI in the financial sector, particularly regarding trust and compliance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAU<|>PERSON<|>Lau is a professional emphasizing the importance of safe and compliant usage of GAI in financial practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAUGHERTY<|>PERSON<|>Daugherty is an expert discussing the impact of AI on investment management and decision-making.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEIKH<|>PERSON<|>Sheikh is a professional involved in the integration of AI into Bloomberg's financial terminal.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREYMATTER<|>GAI<|>Greymatter discusses the impact of GAI on mental health services and innovations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANFORD THERAPY CHATBOT<|>GAI<|>Stanford therapy chatbot is an example of GAI being applied in mental health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOEBOT HEALTH<|>GAI<|>Woebot Health utilizes GAI to provide mental health support<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PITCHBOOK<|>GAI<|>PitchBook has developed tools that leverage GAI for financial predictions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOMBERG<|>GAI<|>Bloomberg has integrated GAI into its services, enhancing financial data analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPTQUANT<|>GAI<|>GPTQuant is a GAI tool for developing investment strategies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANFORD AI INDEX REPORT<|>GAI<|>The report highlights the rise of AI job postings in finance, indicating GAI's impact<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HINKFUSS<|>GAI<|>Hinkfuss discusses the necessity of trust and compliance in the use of GAI in finance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAU<|>GAI<|>Lau emphasizes the importance of safe and compliant usage of GAI in financial practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAUGHERTY<|>GAI<|>Daugherty analyzes how GAI can enhance investment management and decision-making<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEIKH<|>BLOOMBERG<|>Sheikh is involved in the integration of AI into Bloomberg's financial terminal<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
