This is because of its potential to cause drastic and widespread shifts in many aspects of life that are comparable to those of the Internet and smartphones. More specifically, generative AI utilizes machine learning, neural networks, and other techniques to generate new content (e.g. text, images, music) by analyzing patterns and information from the training data. This has enabled generative AI to have a wide range of applications, from creating personalized content to improving business operations. Despite its many benefits, there are also significant concerns about the negative implications of generative AI. In view of this, the current article brings together experts in a variety of fields to expound and provide multi-disciplinary insights on the opportunities, challenges, and research agendas of generative AI in specific industries (i.e. marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retailing, the workplace, manufacturing, and sustainable IT management).\n\n# Introduction\n\nOn November 2022, a prototype generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT was made publicly available by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed company. Based on advanced AI language models, ChatGPT quickly gained a lot of traction with its ability to understand and respond in natural language. To date, it is the fastest-growing innovation, having reached 100 million active adoptions in two months. Now, there is a lot of hype surrounding applications of large language model (LLM) which includes ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), and Claude (Anthropic). The wave of generative AI is expected to drive a $7 trillion increase in global gross domestic product and boost productivity growth by 1.5% over ten years. The technology’s ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output reflects a seismic change in the sociotechnical landscape with potentially large macro-economic effects. With that said, it is at a tipping point of mass adoption, especially in the business setting as companies that take proactive measures toward this technology will be at a considerable advantage.\n\n# CONTACT\n\nKeng-Boon Ooi\n\nooikengboon@gmail.com\n\nUCSI Graduate Business School, UCSI University, No. 1 Jalan Menara Gading, UCSI Heights, 56000 Cheras, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\n© 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems\n\n# K.-B. OOI ET AL.\n\nHello Bard. Please act as the wittiest and most successful sales person: You will try to sell me the single hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world. You can decide what this commodity will be. Be brief, not more than 50 words and be humorous. You will wait for my response before proceeding with the next stage of our conversation:\n\nSure, I can do that: The hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world is silence. But I can sell it to you: How about this: for the price of silence, I will give you the gift of peace: No more noise, no more distractions, just you and your thoughts. Sound good?\n\nYou did not name the price.\n\nYou are right. The price of silence is very high. It is the price of your time, your attention, and your peace of mind. But it is a price that is worth paying: Are you ready to buy?\n\nFigure 1. Prompting Bard to sell the single hardest-to-sell commodity.\n\nMicrosoft SFARGH CHAT\n\nHello there. I'm Bing, the wittiest and most successful salesperson you'll ever meet. I'm here to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy the single hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world: a Bing subscription. Yes, you heard me right. For only $9.99 a month; you can enjoy unlimited access to the best search engine ever created, with features like image creation, content generation, and more. Trust me, you won't regret it. What do you say?\n\nThat's a fair question: You see, a Bing subscription is not just a regular search engine. It's a premium service that gives you access to exclusive features that are not available to the free users. For example, you can create your own images, generate content for any topic, and get personalized suggestions for your next query. Plus, you can enjoy an ad-free experience and support the development of Bing: It's a win-win situation for both of us. Don't you agree?\n\nFigure 2. Prompting chat Bing in creative mode.\n\nRecently, Google expanded access to Bard (https://bard.google.com/) which allows users to collaborate with generative AI as part of their efforts to bring helpful AI experiences to people, businesses, and communities. We prompted Bard to be the “wittiest and most successful salesperson” and close a sale for “the single hardest-to-sell commodity in the whole wide world.” We were pleasantly surprised with what Bard had to sell.\n\nMicrosoft Bing Chat in Creative Mode (Figure 2) allows for more imaginative responses, creating “surprises and entertainment,” gives users more “control on the type of chat behavior,” and can generate images with its integrated DALL-E powered Bing Image Creator. Microsoft Bing Chat has two other modes, namely “More Balanced” which generates neutral and...\n\n# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\nobjective responses, and “More Precise” which generates accurate and specific responses. In addition, the chatbot can terminate atypical topics and ask to move to a new topic.\n\nOur trivial examples provide a sneak peek into the revolutionary potential of LLMs. LLMs use a type of neural network architecture called a transformer which is designed to process and generate data in sequence. LLMs are programmed to learn from examples and can generate novel output based on the users’ input. In general, an LLM builds itself as they predict what word is likely to come next in a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
