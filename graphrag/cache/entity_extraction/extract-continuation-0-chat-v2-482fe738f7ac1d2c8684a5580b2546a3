The move to position CSR as a positive explanatory concept emerged from one particular line of argument in this debate; that CSR activities can be strategically justified because, next to promoting socially beneficial outcomes, they will also positively affect CFP.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\n(Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995). In support of this argument, an entire stream of empirical CSR-CFP research emerged. Since its inception, however, the concept of CSR has met with various critiques. Referred to as a(n) “contestable” (Windsor, 2006, p. 93), “elusive” (Clarkson, 1995, p. 92), and even “epiphenomenal” concept (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008, p. 210), the main concern has always been that CSR is theoretically poorly defined (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Ullmann, 1985; Wood & Jones, 1995) and therefore does not satisfy even the most basic requirements for explanatory concepts in social science.\n\n# A causal approach to conceptualizing Strategic CSR\n\nTo carve out and further develop the explanatory concept of Strategic CSR from the conceptual domain denoted by the concept of CSR more generally, we follow Goertz’ (2006) causal approach to concept formation. Arguing that explanatory concepts in social science are essentially constructed from our causal knowledge on how the phenomenon denoted by the concept interacts with other phenomena, Goertz proposes to define explanatory social science concepts in terms of their causally most relevant general attributes. This causal approach is also a positivist approach to concept formation, because the causally most relevant attributes that jointly define a concept can only be identified through empirical research on the mechanisms through which the phenomenon interacts with other phenomena (a process sometimes referred to as ‘nomological validation’ (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955)).\n\nEmpirically validated causal propositions that prior research has found to explain social reality are therefore deeply embedded in explanatory social science concepts, and can be used to foster an ever better theoretical understanding of these concepts themselves.\n\nAs the bulk of empirical research has used the CSR concept to explain CFP, we are able to develop an understanding of Strategic CSR by identifying those general attributes of CSR that prior research has found to be causally most relevant in explaining CFP. The concept of\n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The development of strategic management concepts by inferring them from performance differentials between firms is an established conceptualization strategy in the strategic management literature and has been foundational for some of the field’s core theories and concepts (for example, the resource-based view: Barney, 1991, 2001; Priem & Butler, 2001; and dynamic capabilities: Winter, 2003; Zahra, Sapienza, & Davidsson, 2006).\n\nIt is also a useful strategy to conceptually demarcate and carve out Strategic CSR from the empirical domain denoted by the CSR concept more generally, as there may also exist CSR activities that do not enhance CFP (Wright & Ferris, 1997). Our conceptualization strategy to demarcate Strategic CSR from CSR more generally is graphically illustrated by the Venn diagram in Figure 1. The outer rectangle captures the universe of all firm activities. Within this universe, CSR activities are those firm activities that “appear to further some social good” (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001, p. 117). Within the set of CSR activities more generally, there are some CSR activities that positively contribute to firm performance and some that do not. Only the former are part of the empirical domain denoted by the concept of Strategic CSR. We aim to further develop the concept of Strategic CSR by unveiling the mechanisms through which CSR contributes to CFP, and which identify the causally most relevant attributes of Strategic CSR.\n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nTo identify the general attributes of Strategic CSR, we survey five decades of empirical research on the CSR–CFP relationship. While early empirical research investigated the direct relationship between CSR and CFP (Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Cochran & Wood, 1984; Mcguire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), more recent research has documented that the relationship is mediated by other strategically relevant variables (Surroca et al., 2010). By surveying the available research, we seek to uncover the most important mediating mechanisms through which CSR has been found to affect CFP. We focus only on those mechanisms for which sufficient primary studies are available to test the hypotheses developed through our review using MASEM (Bergh et al., 2016). This leads us to identify four empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to affect CFP, that is, through: 1) enhanced firm reputation, 2) stakeholder reciprocation, 3) risk mitigation, and 4) improved innovation capacity.\n\nBelow, we review the literature on these four mechanisms, and conclude each subsection with articulating a hypothesis that theoretically predicts how CSR affects CFP through this mechanism. We propose that these four mechanisms are conceptually and empirically distinct and identify four different causally relevant general attributes of Strategic\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>EVENT<|>Strategic CSR is a concept that connects corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to firm competitive advantages and financial performance, developed through empirical research and theoretical frameworks in strategic management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CSR<|>EVENT<|>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to business practices involving initiatives that benefit society, which can also impact a firm's financial performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOERTZ<|>PERSON<|>Goertz is a scholar who proposed a causal approach to concept formation in social science, emphasizing the importance of empirical research in defining explanatory concepts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>Baron is a researcher who first coined the term Strategic CSR and contributed to its development in the context of strategic management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCWILLIAMS<|>PERSON<|>McWilliams is a scholar who further developed the concept of Strategic CSR, linking it to strategic management and firm performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALDMAN<|>PERSON<|>Waldman is a researcher who contributed to the development of Strategic CSR, connecting it to competitive advantages in firms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NELSON<|>PERSON<|>Nelson is a scholar referenced in the context of performance differentials between firms and strategic management concepts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUMELT<|>PERSON<|>Rumelt is a researcher whose work is foundational in the field of strategic management, particularly regarding performance differentials.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTER<|>PERSON<|>Winter is a scholar associated with the development of dynamic capabilities in strategic management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZAHRA<|>PERSON<|>Zahra is a researcher who has contributed to the understanding of dynamic capabilities and their relevance in strategic management.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>CSR<|>Strategic CSR is a specific subset of CSR that focuses on activities that enhance firm performance and competitive advantage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOERTZ<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Goertz's causal approach to concept formation is used to develop and understand Strategic CSR<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Baron coined the term Strategic CSR and laid the groundwork for its development in strategic management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCWILLIAMS<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>McWilliams further developed the concept of Strategic CSR, linking it to firm performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALDMAN<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Waldman contributed to the understanding of Strategic CSR in relation to competitive advantages<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NELSON<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Nelson's work on performance differentials informs the understanding of Strategic CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUMELT<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Rumelt's foundational theories in strategic management relate to the principles of Strategic CSR<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINTER<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Winter's research on dynamic capabilities is relevant to the mechanisms of Strategic CSR<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZAHRA<|>STRATEGIC CSR<|>Zahra's contributions to dynamic capabilities provide insights into the attributes of Strategic CSR<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
