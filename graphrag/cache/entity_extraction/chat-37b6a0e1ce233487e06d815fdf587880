Encouraging environmental innovation is important to achieving highly efficient production technology and methods to improve CS performance. Moreover, through encouraging environmental innovation, the industry can have the capacity to address preservation of natural resources, industrial efficiency and finally achieve the profit improvement. Therefore, eco-efficiency can provide both environmental and economic benefits through production efficiency.\n\nAlthough social resource is argued as an inessential part in SRM (Sanginga et al., 2003), this study supports Bouwen and Taillieu (2004) that the social aspect presents great benefits to pursue CS through SRM practice. Therein, organizing synergetic involvement (C9) entails the alignment of multiple stakeholders’ engagement with firms' CS strategy, and long-term cooperative relationships between themselves and investors in capital markets. Without organizing synergetic involvement...\n\n# L.
