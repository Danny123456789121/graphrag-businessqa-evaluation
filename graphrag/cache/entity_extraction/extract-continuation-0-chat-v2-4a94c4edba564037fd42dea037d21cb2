Then, to test hypothesis #3 we repeat the analysis separately for ESG news published by firms, media and NGOs. Table 2 presents average abnormal returns (AAR0) and cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR½ 1;þ1 and CAAR½ 5;þ5), with the corresponding standard deviation in parentheses, for each.\n\n15 We only consider news in English.\n\n16 R&D spendings (divided the total assets) and percentage of floating shares have been used also, but the availability of the data (moreover, only annual) lowers the size of the sample without changing meaningfully the results.\n\n# G.

Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. AAR½t¼0 is the average abnormal return the day of the publication, CAAR½ 1;þ1 and CAAR½ 5;þ5 are the cumulative average abnormal returns over 3 and 10 days, respectively, around the publication. The estimation window is ½ 70; 11. Figures are in percent. Data on ESG news are from Covalence EthicalQuote. The sample is composed of 100 companies considered between 2002 and 2010. *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, 1% level respectively.\n\nOverall, ordinary ESG disclosures impact firm’s market value, but mainly negatively. In support of hypothesis #1, the cumulative average abnormal return in a 3-day (10-day) event window is -0.085% (-0.139%) for negative events and +0.016% (+0.035%) for positive events for the full sample. The magnitude of the impact is low, but it is significant at the 1% level for negative events; in contrast, as stated in hypothesis #2, the average change in firm’s market value around the publication of positive ESG news is barely significant. Accordingly, while shareholders seem to penalize bad corporate social responsibility, they do not really reward positive behaviors. Figure 2 shows the daily cumulative average abnormal returns over a 20-day time window around the publication of negative or positive ESG events. This figure clearly illustrates the significant declines in stock price for firms that were targets of negative ESG news. Meanwhile, the trend for positive ESG news is unclear. This asymmetry is in line with most of the previous literature (except Flammer 2013). Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn (2011) even find that voluntary certifications such as Climate Leaders and Ceres generate market penalties. Thus, ESG investments are not always perceived as profitable by the stock markets.\n\nNote that this first set of results holds when we consider alternative specifications: with a restricted sample that excludes events for which abnormal returns are likely to be misspecified (i.e., when parameters of the market model are jointly not significant), with or without sectoral indexes, with a longer estimation window cleaned of contaminating events, or with the Fama-French 4 factors. Those results are available on request.\n\nThe only source of ESG news that seems relevant for shareholders is the media (hypothesis #3). Negative ESG news disclosed by the media generate significant losses. In a 3-day (10-day) event window, these news caused cumulative average abnormal returns of -0.092% (-0.137%), which represent an average loss of $0.25 ($0.37) per share. Not surprisingly, firm’s press releases are not market movers. Most striking, albeit consistent with some concerns about their lack of credibility, the financial impact of ESG news published by NGOs are not significant. Confronted to a profusion of competing daily news, investors may react strongly to a disclosure that is not genuinely new (Huberman and Regev 2001). NGOs’ disclosures may influence media information (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017), while only media information directly influence investors.
