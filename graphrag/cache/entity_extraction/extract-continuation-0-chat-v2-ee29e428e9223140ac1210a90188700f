As noted earlier, none of these journals published a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period of our sample. Emphasising their importance to the pursuit of knowledge generally, the three leading finance journals are placed among the top 100 journals in the world for all disciplines (according to 2016 SJR rankings).\n\nMeaningful action to understand and address the impacts of climate change on the financial system requires the engagement of the best minds from academic finance and the attention of the leading journals that define the agendas in their fields. Leading finance journals should be publishing research on a range of climate finance-related topics including risks (e.g. speculative bubbles, financial contagion), valuation (e.g. carbon-risk disclosure requirements and related market impacts across numerous asset classes), opportunities (e.g. debt and equity market ‘green’ financing) and corporate strategies (e.g. divestments and used of hedging instruments).\n\nUntil the top journals in finance and business signal that they are receptive to climate finance-related research, the best finance researchers are unlikely to engage. Since the articles from leading finance journals tend to underpin the finance curriculums of undergraduate and especially postgraduate qualifications in finance, perhaps the most prominent impact of the dearth of climate finance-related research in leading finance journals is that the next generation of finance practitioners may be underprepared to tackle climate change-related issues.\n\nWhat might be done to alleviate this situation? First, there needs to be a better understanding of why leading finance journals have not engaged with climate change. We have offered several possible explanations above, but surveys or interviews of finance academics could provide substantiating evidence. Roundtables and seminars where senior finance academics (especially editors) are introduced to climate finance topics might also help. In this respect, professional and regulatory bodies engaged with climate finance issues could play an important role in bringing academics to the table. The Chartered Financial Analysts Institute and the Financial Stability Board (especially its Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) could be possible conduits. Finally, research funders can help by creating dedicated funding streams for climate finance issues that require interdisciplinary teams including finance researchers.\n\nThrough the data and analysis presented here, we do not in any way seek to diminish finance research. We hope it can provide a stimulus to encourage leading finance researchers to engage with climate change and the many financial risks and opportunities it creates. That way, climate finance topics can benefit from the knowledge, methods and insights in finance research. This in turn will lead to better policymaking in what is surely one of the defining topics for finance and capital markets in the coming years and decades.\n\n# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nIDR acknowledges University of Otago research leave funding which made this research possible.
