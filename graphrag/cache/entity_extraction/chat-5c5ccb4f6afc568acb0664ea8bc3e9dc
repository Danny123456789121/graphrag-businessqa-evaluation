Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\nPublished papers have a smaller impact on AESs. This is again inconsistent with the argument of publication bias.\n\nIn addition, we perform a test for publication bias using the Egger test of Stata 14.0 and report the result in Table 9. Since the intercept is not significantly different from zero, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no publication bias. Therefore, we can conclude that publication bias is not a serious concern for our paper.\n\nThe negative coefficient for the publication variable may indicate the quality of papers. Since authors have to go through a rigorous reviewing process to publish their papers in good journals, overly affirmative or overly negative results will be toned down. Thus, if the reviewing process is more rigorous, the AES will become smaller. To examine this idea, we introduce a new variable, Quality, which captures the quality of papers. It is equal to one for journals above median\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
