Another view to bridge the gaps between the policy and implementation needs a thorough translation of the policy into action plans, such as setting the objective, preparing the guidelines, and action plans (Epstein and Roy 2007) (see Figs. 2 and 3).\n\n# Limitation\n\nSince the CS is a broad concept, so as its policy and practice too. Thus, it is a challenging task to explore the entire body of knowledge. Hence, this review paper is limited to six (see Table 2) leading publishers with 10 keywords; more specifically, only CS policy and practice related significant paper were chosen for review.\n\n# Implications\n\n# Theoretical implication\n\nIn this review paper, stakeholder theory appeared as the most cited theory and institutional theory is the second most cited theory. It has come the foreground that institutional theory is embedded in the stakeholder theory or we can say that stakeholder theory encapsulate the isomorphic and defusion elements of institutional theory. This encapsulation will implicate the future research to expand and explore the further depth of stakeholder theory.\n\nIn this review paper specific factors and subfactors explored (see Fig. 3 and Table 7) which has impact on CS policy practices. These factors and subfactors will serve as base work for future quantitative research studies.\n\nFurthermore, schematic snapshot developed on the basis of this review paper (see Fig. 2) depicts that how the global sustainability initiative creates trickle down impact from United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and penetrates in signatory countries macro and meso level policymaking institutions and subsequently encourages the companies operating in respective countries for practices of social and environmental dimensions. When the firms start practicing social and environmental initiatives, then the role of different management theories emerges according to the pressure of different stakeholders operating in the internal and external environment the companies.\n\nThe triple bottom line framework is operating in the management system, yet the volume of practices of social and environmental dimensions on the company basis, and in return its impact on society and environment is still vague. Researchers need to further investigate to devise methods so that utilization of financial capital and HR capital for CS practices may be quantitatively compared with the policy outcome of a company.\n\nKeeping in view the essence of co-evolutionary theory, in this review paper, it has emerged that lack of knowledge of CS and policy making among stakeholders is hindering in obtaining the maximum advantage of limited resources and strengths of stakeholders. This essential implication of this review paper invites the policymakers to address it.\n\n# Practical implication\n\nThis review paper will contribute as an authentic snapshot for future practitioners from two perspectives. First perspective is the eight different policy approaches being adopted by the policy makers (see Table 4). Each policy approach has its own significance and varies from sector to sector and business to business, and practitioners can formulate their organizational policy in the light of stated approaches. Second perspective is the factors affecting CS policy and practices (see Tables 5 and 6); the implications of these factors can contribute as a guidance tool in the process of policy making to avoid intermittent which causes the gaps in CS policy and practice.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nFor future research, it is recommended to investigate the magnitude of factors and subfactors of CS Practices (see Fig. 3). It is also recommended to investigate the magnitude and direction of factors in Table 7 on CS practices. Furthermore, it is recommended to understand the effectivity of co-evolutionary theory in collaboration with the stakeholder theory.\n\n# Author’s contributions\n\nThe authors contributed to the study conception and design.
