In particular, we construct the greenness and transparency factor fg,t as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent firms and the firms that do some environmental disclosure, but only attain lower levels of greenness and transparency. The former set of firms correspond to the greener and more transparent portfolio as defined in Section 5, i.e. the one including firms in the top quintile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator. The latter set of firms correspond to those in the lower quintile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator. Formally, the greenness and transparency factor is constructed as\n\n18\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nAlso in this case, we test both specifications of the greenness and transparency indicator on the two samples (see Rob. 1.3, 2.3, 3.3 and 4.3).\n\n# Table 5\n\nTable 5 reports the estimated Greenium ˆg and the estimated coefficient ˆg for Rob. 1.1 - Rob. 2.3. The results are based on a four-factor model including the factors in the Carhart model and the greenness and transparency factor.\n\nFocussing on the Greenium, tuning the parameter γ in the benchmark case (i.e., Rob. 1.1) provides results in line with the evidence presented in the previous section. The Greenium is always negative and significant at the 1% confidence level for γ = 0.2, 0.5 and γ = 0.8. Rob. 1.2 and 1.3 use the alternative definitions of the greenness and transparency factor. Building the factor by considering all nontransparent firms instead of only brown firms (Rob. 1.2) still yields a negative and significant Greenium at the 1% level for γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.8, while it is negative and significant at the 5% level for γ = 0.2. Building the factor by considering only transparent firms (Rob. 1.3) yields a negative and significant Greenium for γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.8, at the 5% and 1% confidence level, respectively. Notice that the variation in the size of the Greenium in Rob. 1.2 and 1.3 compared to Rob. 1.1 is purely mechanical, due to the smaller expected value of f g,t and f g,t compared to E[fg,t].\n\nLooking at the lower part of Table 5, Rob. 2.1 - 2.3 estimate the model on the larger sample of European stocks. Considering the benchmark definition for the factor and with γ = 0.5, the Greenium remains negative and significant at the 10% level. Considering the two alternative definitions for the factor, the Greenium remains negative and significant at the 5% and 10% level for Rob. 2.2 and Rob. 2.3, respectively. Varying γ on this larger sample yield a negative Greenium in some instances, but results are generally less strong in terms of significance. Notably, the specifications based on γ = 1, i.e. using only on emission data, are associated with a non-significant Greenium on the larger sample as well.\n\nFocussing on the columns corresponding to extreme values for γ, i.e. γ = 0 and γ = 1, allows us to grasp the importance of the two components of the greenness and transparency indicator. The Greenium is not, or only mildly, significantly different from zero in most exercises. This indicates that only the combination of emission intensity and disclosure quality is generally priced by the market. In no case an indicator based on emissions only (γ = 1) is associated with a significant risk premium, suggesting that investors do not look at emissions only. At the same time, with γ = 0, i.e. when only the completeness of environmental disclosures matters, the Greenium is still negative and significant at 5% or 10% in half of the exercises. This finding suggests that investors do pay attention to the overall quality of firms’ environmental disclosures, over and above their actual emissions.\n\nAs for ν, which is linked to the existence of market frictions, the estimates ˆg based on Rob. 1.1. are in line with the results for the risk premium and the cross-sectional parameter ν corresponding to the greenness and transparency factor. Estimation results for the other observable factors are available upon request. The results for these factors are in line with the ones for the benchmark case described in Section 5.2.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649\n\nthe benchmark case both in terms of sign and significance for γ = 0.2, 0.8, 1 , while ˆg with γ = 0 is not significantly ν different from zero. Looking at the other robustness checks, ˆg remains generally significant. However, estimates ν of ν tend to lose significance more on the larger sample, because the distribution of the factor loadings bˆi for the greenness and transparency factor is characterized by a larger standard deviation on the larger sample, compared to the distribution of the loadings based on the smaller sample.\n\nFinally, Table 6 shows results using the the greenness and transparency indicator defined in Equation (9). The more unstable behavior of this version of the indicator does not affect the results.
