We advance this field of research not only by introducing ambivalent managerial interpretations of sustainability issues but also by elaborating on the cognitive determinants of univalent and ambivalent interpretations. In previous research on the antecedents of managers’ ambivalent interpretation of strategic issues, scholars have focused on organizational factors (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Our cognitive framing perspective adds individual-level factors to the picture. While Barr, Stimpert, and Huff (1992) found that decision makers’ cognitive frames link cues from the organizational context to managerial decision making, we explain how differences in the content and structure of a manager’s frame act at the different stages of the sensemaking process.\n\nAs another important implication, we add to research on the different types of responses managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. In this context, a manager’s sense of control and perception of risk have been discussed as key determinants of the choice of different responses (George et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 1993) and of associated decision-making biases (Das & Teng, 1999; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Our analysis of the effects of differences in frame content and frame structure sheds new light on the sometimes contradictory implications that have resulted from the application of different theoretical lenses to managerial risk and perceptions of control (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; George et al., 2006). We suggest that with different cognitive frames managers’ sense of control over an issue may stem from fundamentally different sources. Likewise, we expect managers to perceive and deal with the riskiness of potential responses differently, depending on which of the two frames they hold. These cognitively determined differences have important implications for managerial decision making on ambiguous sustainability issues. The pragmatic and prudent stances that we expect to be associated with the business case frame and the paradoxical frame, respectively, suggest that commonly used classifications of issue responses along general classifications, such as the reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive (RDAP) scale (Clarkson, 1995; Wartick & Cochran, 1985), may be too simplistic. Managers with a pragmatic stance favor responses of limited scope based on established routines and practices, which considerably limits their proactiveness, yet their propensity to develop workable solutions can potentially bring about large-scale change. Managers with a prudent stance may consider unusual and more radical departures from established routines, yet they are hampered in their ability to implement workable solutions because of their ambivalence and higher awareness of risk and tensions. The often-bemoaned reluctance of firms and their managers to address in a radical fashion the immense challenges that sustainability presents (Whiteman et al., 2013) may thus be rooted in the cognitive predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames. Owing to their pragmatic stance, managers with a business case frame rarely consider deviating from established routines but rely instead on incrementalism; paradoxically minded managers may well see the need to consider bolder responses to sustainability issues but shy away from such endeavors since they are hampered by ambivalence and prudence.\n\nThis argument highlights the need to address the interplay of the two cognitive types, since both business case and paradoxical frames have their role to play in bringing about change but may operate at different stages. Because they go beyond a focus on economic attributes alone, the relatively few managers with a more\n\nparadoxical frame might act as pioneers to pro- propose comprehensive responses that depart from existing routines. However, the translation of these responses into practice may well require managers with a more business case– oriented frame, who are cognitively predisposed to re- ducing the complexity of sustainability issues to a level that enables the implementation of these novel practices at a large scale. Neither of the two frames alone will be sufficient to bring about managerial responses that measure up to the immense challenges sustainability presents.\n\nThe interplay of different cognitive types has various practical and theoretical implications. With regard to managerial practice, in the nascent field of sustainable human resource management (Ehnert, 2009), the composition of teams of different cognitive types may play an important role in the management of sustainability issues. Mirroring findings on the combination of different cognitive styles in the composition of successful innovation teams (Miron-Spektor, Erez, & Naveh, 2011), teams dominated by either business case–minded or paradoxical types may be less successful in implementing innovative responses to sustainability challenges than mixed teams. By avoiding a strong bias in such teams toward one of the two cognitive types, firms can make sure they remain aware of the complexity of sustainability issues (due to the presence of paradoxical types) without losing sight of the need to implement workable solutions (due to the presence of business case types).\n\nOur argument also has theoretical implications for the growing body of literature on hybrid organizations. While this literature conceptualizes conflicting financial and social goals in terms of competing institutional logics (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Pache & Santos, 2013), our focus on the interplay of different cognitive types highlights the relevance of individual-level factors when organizations face competing demands. Our argument suggests that the presence of decision makers who accept competing financial, environmental, and social objectives through paradoxical thinking (Smith, Gonin, & Besharov, 2013) might not be sufficient. Rather, the coexistence and the interplay of different cognitive types, where some are aware of tensions but others are not, appear to play a critical role not only for the management of corporate sustainability in for-profit firms but also for the successful implementation of hybrid business models.\n\nFinally, we believe that addressing a greater cognitive diversity of managers promises considerable further\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANDERSSON<|>PERSON<|>Andersson is a researcher who contributed to the sustainability
