Adopting the Sufficiency Thinking model as the research framework, this study uses a qualitative research approach with a set of different data collection techniques to explore a sample Small–Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) called Plan Creation. Collected data are identified as themes, according to the Sufficiency Thinking model. Our findings reveal that there is a close fit between the collected data and the Sufficiency Thinking model. Virtuous attributes, individual and shared knowledge and the decision-making framework of Sufficiency Mindset are observed through the sustainable leadership actions, leading to, among other things, social and environmental innovation. Implications for practicing managers and directions for future research are also discussed.\n\nKeywords: sustainable leadership; SMEs; organization; sustainability; corporate sustainability; sufficiency economy; SEP\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nA great number of social scientists globally [1–9] have been on their search since the 1980s for an alternative to the mainstream U.S. business model that opts for maximizing short-term shareholder value, arguably leading to corporate bankruptcy. According to social scientists, the prevailing approach is fundamentally flawed, and does not lead to the wellbeing and happiness that human being desires. What then represents a different option?\n\nCorporate sustainability is defined as “Meeting the needs of firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, clients, pressure groups, communities without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well” [10] (p. 131). In a time of uncertainty and complexity, organizations strive to survive and sustain themselves. In a quest for an approach to do so, several concepts have gained interest from practitioners. In Thailand, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) is recognized as a philosophical approach to sustainable development [3]. A recent bibliometric review [11] has also indicated that the Sufficiency Economy philosophy is a school of thought in Asia on sustainable organization management. Internationally, SEP is also fundamental to the theory of corporate sustainability [12]. However, much is still unknown empirically about the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in business organizations. Thus, the focal research question of this study is how systematically business organizations adopt the Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve their sustainability performance.\n\nConsequently, the present study’s objective is to explore how corporate leaders practically ensure their organizational sustainability. The following section reviews the empirical and conceptual literature.\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 9204; doi:10.3390/su12219204 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204\n\nspecifically on the philosophy of Sufficiency Economy. Relevant literature on sustainability performance is also reviewed. Then, the overall research methodology used in this study is described. We proceed by introducing our sample Small–Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) named Plan Creation or PlanToys. We conclude this paper by introducing some important recommendations drawn from the findings for practicing managers and business leaders and future research directions for researchers.\n\n# 2. Background Literature\n\nKnowledge of a whole SEP approach to corporate sustainability is very limited, even though the corporate sustainability topic has gained enormous interest from scholars and practitioners around the globe [ 13 –17 ]. This section presents the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) formulated by His Majesty King Rama IX of Thailand as a whole approach to corporate sustainability. The philosophy is unofficially translated below [7] (p. 128).\n\n“Sufficiency Economy is a philosophy that stresses the middle path as an overriding principle for appropriate conduct by the populace at all levels. This applies to conduct starting from the level of families to communities and to the nation in terms of development and administration, so as to modernize in line with the forces of globalization. “Sufficiency” means moderation, reasonableness, and the need for self-immunity to protect from impacts arising from internal and external change. To achieve sufficiency, an application of knowledge with due consideration and prudence is essential. In particular, great care is needed in the utilization of theories and methodologies for planning and implementation in every step. At the same time, it is essential to strengthen the moral fiber of the nation, so that everyone, particularly public officials, academics, and business people at all levels, adhere first and foremost to the principles of honesty and integrity. In addition, a way of life based on patience, perseverance, diligence, wisdom and prudence is indispensable in creating balance and in coping appropriately with critical challenges arising from extensive and rapid socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural changes in the world.”\n\nHis Majesty King Rama IX of Thailand derived the philosophy of Sufficiency Economy from his accumulated wisdom and insights throughout his 58 years of the throne [18]. His Majesty emphasized the “middle” path as the universal principle to life for Thai people at all levels and domains of application. The philosophy allows for a strategy for the nation to balance the national development and to deal with external forces. It emphasizes the requirement for adequate protection from shocks from inside and outside the nation. His Majesty reiterated the philosophy, after the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, in which countless large\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
