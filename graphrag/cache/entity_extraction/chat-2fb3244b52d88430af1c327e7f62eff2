Financial Performance\n\nPerformance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. The company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability. Measurement of the profitability ratio can use ROA (Return On Asset). Return On Assets, or also known as economic profitability, is operating profit with own capital and foreign capital used to generate profits and expressed as a percentage (Platonova et al., 2018). This ratio is used to measure the rate of return on investment that the company has made using all its assets.\n\n# 4.2. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)\n\nThe first hypothesis states that green accounting is able to improve CSMS in manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The analysis result shows that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.15, so that the first hypothesis can be accepted. This indicates that the increasing implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia is able to increase the implementation of CSMS. Accounting in this case, especially in green accounting, proves that it is able to support the sustainable development of the company. We know that green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The ability of companies to apply green accounting in their business, to be able to manage costs related to the environment and to have an impact on the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. The results of this study are aligned with the research by Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) that states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.\n\n# 4.3. Green Accounting on Financial Performance\n\nThe second hypothesis states that increasing green accounting can improve financial performance. The analysis results show that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.27.\n\n# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738\n\nI Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA\n\n# 4.4. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance\n\nThese results indicate that the company implementing green accounting is able to show good environmental performance, so the impact is on good financial performance. So, the second hypothesis can be accepted. The effect of green accounting with financial performance can be observed in terms of revenue and costs. Increased implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia can maximize revenue potential and increase efficiency in terms of costs. On the cost side, there are many benefits that companies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability.\n\nWhen integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values.\n\nGA 8EU27 FF (RJi (P<.01) (RJIi B= 0222 R2_0.14 B=0.15 (Pz0.02) (P=O 01)\n\nCSMS (RJti R2_0.02\n\n# Figure 3: Research Results A\n\n# Table 2: Model fit and quality indices\n\n|Average path coefficient (APC)|= 0.212|P = 0.013|\n|---|---|---|\n|Average R-squared (ARS)|= 0.081|P = 0.118|\n|Average adjusted R-squared (AARS)|= 0.063|P = 0.145|\n|Average block VIF (AVIF)|= 1.027|acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3|\n|Average full collinearity VIF (AFVIF)|= 1.103|acceptable if <= 5, Ideally <= 3.3|\n|Tenenhaus GoF (GoF)|= 0.285|small >= 0.1, medium >= 0.25, large >= 0.36|\n|Sympson’s paradox ratio (SPR)|= 1.000|acceptable if >= 0.7, ideally = 1|\n|R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR)|= 1.000|acceptable if >= 0.9, ideally = 1|\n|Statistical suppression ratio (SSR)|= 1.000|acceptable if >= 0.7|\n|Nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR)|= 0.833|acceptable if >= 0.7|\n\n# 5. Conclusions\n\nAllocation of environmental costs in green accounting through the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) is one of the strategic policies for manufacturing companies in Indonesia, so that it can improve financial performance, because it is related to company policies in allocating costs to environmental activities, investment, and funding.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
