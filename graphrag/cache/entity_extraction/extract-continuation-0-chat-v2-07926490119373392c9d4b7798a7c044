Bauer et al. (2007) examine a sample of Canadian ethical funds and again find no significant difference between SRI and conventional funds. In addition, there are still many papers that report no difference between SRI and conventional investments (Sauer, 1997; Hutton et al., 1998; Benson et al., 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Renneboog et al., 2008a; Humphrey et al., 2016). Therefore, we establish a null hypothesis on the overall effect of SRI as follows.\n\n# Hypothesis 1.\n\nThe influence of SRI will not be different from zero.\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\n# Meta-analysis on SRI\n\n# 2.2. Sampling Issues\n\n# 2.2.1. Time\n\nAmong various sampling issues that generate the SRI performance documented in many studies, the first-order effect could be caused by the change in the conceptualization of social responsibility. Over the past three decades, not only firms but also investors have changed their views on CSR. In earlier years, the CSR strategy may have been adopted by innovative firms and the SRI strategy, including these firms, may have outperformed conventional investment strategies. However, the relative advantage of SRI may have weakened over time since the uniqueness of SRI has decreased as more firms promote CSR activities. This process will lead to a lower abnormal return over time. It is also possible that investing communities will learn from academic studies. As more investors use SRI investment strategy via the learning process, the return can diminish. Consistent with this argument, Hoepner and Schopohl (2018) show that estimates for the impact of SRI become marginally significant or lose their significance over the sub-period 2008–2015 when compared with the entire sample period 2001–2015.\n\nHowever, the dampening impact SRI process may not be a uniformly decreasing one, but rather alternate in sign. Research in general tends to show three dialectical stages of development (O’Connor, 2003). A thesis is posited in the beginning and it gives rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis. Finally, a synthesis resolves the tension between the two. We can expect that research in the SRI area may also follow a similar pattern. Since the merits of SRI were overemphasized in the beginning, an argument of negative impact shows up as an antithesis which is followed by a synthesis that supports no or less impact. As for the degree of fluctuation, it will decrease over time. Since methodologies have become more sophisticated over time, any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios caused by misspecification of methodologies will become smaller over time. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis 2-1. ESs are positive in the beginning and change signs with decreasing absolute value.\n\nDuring times of economic crisis, portfolio performance reduces compared to normal periods. The SRI performance will follow a similar pattern and the ESs computed from the sample period including a crisis will be different from those in normal periods. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis 2-2. Papers whose sample periods include a crisis period will show smaller ESs than papers whose sample periods do not include a crisis.\n\n# 2.2.2. Publication\n\nOne of the important considerations in meta-analysis regarding sampling is publication bias. As the phrase “Publish or Perish” signifies, publication is imperative in academia (Zivney and Bertin, 1992). Since so many papers are submitted, academic\n\n© 2019 Korean Securities Association\n\nC.-S. Kim\n\nJournals have become very selective and papers with a high statistical significance are more likely to be published than papers with insignificant results (Song et al., 2000). According to Stanley (2005), we can suspect that type II selection error, that is, a tendency to report significant results excessively, exists if the values of standardized ESs exceed 1.96 more than 5% of the time. Other things being equal, if a publication bias exists, published papers will have higher ESs, either positive or negative. In order to check whether our sample has publication bias, we establish the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 3.\n\nThe AESs for published papers will be higher than those for unpublished papers.\n\n# 2.2.3. Author type.\n\nPapers written by professional managers and scholars can show differences in ESs since they are quite different in various respects, including incentives for performing research. For example, Vaihekoski (2004) mentions that academic researchers are, in general, concerned with aspects related to asset pricing, whereas institutional investors are primarily interested in detecting opportunities that can generate superior risk-adjusted performance. Asset pricing is closely related to the efficient market hypothesis, and insignificant differences between SRI performances and conventional portfolios can be accepted as confirming market efficiency. However, if a large difference is found between the two performances, justification regarding the causes of the difference is often quite challenging. Among industry professionals, however, market efficiency is not accepted as a norm, so researchers from financial industries may pay more attention to finding profit potential than supporting market efficiency. Therefore, we conjecture that researchers in academia tend to find a smaller performance difference between SRI and conventional groups than industry professionals. In order to test this argument, we propose the following hypothesis.\n\n# Hypothesis 4-1.\n\nThe AESs obtained by academic researchers will be smaller than those obtained by industry researchers.\n\nIt is possible that researchers in different disciplines may have different perspectives on SRI and this will lead to a systematic difference in their\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN SECURITIES ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Korean Securities Association is an organization involved in the study and analysis of securities and investment strategies, including Socially Responsible Investment (SRI).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SRI<|>EVENT<|>Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) refers to investment strategies that consider both financial return and social/environmental good, which has been analyzed in various studies over the years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADIAN ETHICAL FUNDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Canadian ethical funds are investment funds that adhere to ethical guidelines and are part of the SRI analysis conducted in Canada.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>GEO<|>A group of countries in Europe that have been studied for their SRI funds and performance in comparison to conventional funds.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals engaged in academic research who study the performance and implications of SRI compared to conventional investment strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS<|>PERSON<|>Professionals working in the financial industry who may have different perspectives on SRI compared to academic researchers.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOREAN SECURITIES ASSOCIATION<|>SRI<|>The Korean Securities Association conducts studies and meta-analyses on SRI and its performance in comparison to conventional investments.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANADIAN ETHICAL FUNDS<|>SRI<|>Canadian ethical funds are a part of the SRI analysis, showcasing their performance in relation to conventional funds.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>SRI<|>European countries have been investigated for their SRI funds, contributing to the overall understanding of SRI performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS<|>SRI<|>Academic researchers study SRI and its implications, often leading to findings that may differ from those of industry professionals.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS<|>SRI<|>Industry professionals analyze SRI from a practical investment perspective, which may differ from academic findings.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
