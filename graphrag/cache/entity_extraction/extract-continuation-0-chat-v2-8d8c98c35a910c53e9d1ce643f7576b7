Therefore, to fill the aforementioned research gap, this study used psychological ownership theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV. This study explored the relationships of GSV with employee green confusion (EGC) and employee environmental performance (EEP) as well as the mediating effect of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. The research results indicate that GSV positively affects GPPO, EGC, and EEP. Moreover, GSV also influences behavior and performance through personal psychological processes. Thus, if an enterprise wishes to establish GSV, it must adopt a series of supporting measures, including improving members’ GPPO, to effectively reduce EGC and improve EEP to realize the goal of sustainable development.\n\nKeywords: green shared vision; psychological ownership theory; green product psychological ownership; employee green confusion; employee environmental performance\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nCorporate strategies worldwide are affected by environmental management issues [1]. When enterprises support environmental protection and actively participate in environmental management, they not only pursue corporate values but also improve their image by complying with environmental regulations [2]. Enterprises should embrace the philosophy of sustainability with a creative mind in this environmentalistic age [3, 4]. In general, shared visions are developed at the organizational, group, or individual levels to generate motivation for achieving transformation from a present status to a desirable end status [5]. When the organizational planner has a strong vision, the sustainable development of a company is promoted [6]. Obtaining a better understanding of the driving forces behind the phenomena might help new companies to integrate resources and enhance their corporate performance [7]. A corporate shared vision is a key factor affecting the competitive advantage of a corporation over other entities. Currently, sustainable development has become an important issue worldwide. The pursuit and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) has become a trend for companies. Therefore, corporate sustainability has become a major topic.\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 10514; doi:10.3390/su122410514\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\n# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514\n\nCorporate sustainability refers to decreasing the waste of natural resources (especially nonrenewable resources) to zero during enterprise operational activities to reduce the damage caused by corporate activities on society or the environment [8]. Corporate sustainability has become an indispensable strategy for many companies today [9 – 11]. Such strategies are gradually being integrated into company activities and culture, whether with respect to the corporate system (including operations), strategies, organizational systems, or stakeholders (internal and external as well as social and environmental) [12]. Corporate sustainability has become the basis of sustainable success [13]. When employees and organizations have different values, implementing a developed sustainability plan is difficult [14]. Employees are the core resource of an enterprise [15]. Employees play an important role in maintaining the competitive advantage of an organization. They also determine the performance of the organization [16]. A company’s ability to achieve a competitive advantage is related to its ability to employ excellent talent [17].\n\nGiven the aforementioned information, employees play an important role when designing sustainable development strategies for an enterprise. The occurrence of employee green confusion (EGC) cannot be ruled out when employees promote green shared vision (GSV). However, studies on green confusion have not focused on the views of an enterprise’s employees. Most of these studies have examined consumer orientation and have focused on the effects of greenwash on consumers, such as the effects of greenwash on green consumer confusion and green trust [18] as well as environmental and product perceptions [19]. Thus, employee orientation related to confusion in the field of corporate sustainability has been rarely discussed. To fill this research gap, the present study proposes a new concept called EGC. This study refers to the definition of Chen and Chang [18] to define EGC as the confusion of employees regarding the environmental characteristics of company products or services. The present study developed an integral framework of employee environmental performance (EEP). It also investigated the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP as well as the mediating effects of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. Environmentalism is an important corporate issue today, and EEP is critical to corporate sustainability. This research enables a better understanding of the effects of a shared vision and various types of integration on corporate management.\n\nStudies have rarely used a theoretical basis to explore the effect of organizational members’ psychological processes on the organization’s environmental management performance [1,20 – 26]. This study investigated the effect of GSV on GPPO, EGC, and EEP by focusing on company staff and using psychological ownership (PO) theory and expected price theory. We used the obtained findings to fill the research gap on EGC issues in corporate sustainability research. This study proposes a comprehensive conceptual structure to explore the effect of company members’ psychological processes regarding the company’s green issues on the company\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TAIPEI<|>GEO<|>Taipei is the capital city of Taiwan and is home to the National Defense University where the research was conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Defense University in Taipei focuses on resources management and decision science, contributing to research on corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL TAIPEI UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Taipei University in New Taipei City is involved in business administration and contributes to research on corporate sustainability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIWAN<|>GEO<|>Taiwan is an island nation where the research on corporate sustainability and environmental behavior is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN SHARED VISION (GSV)<|>EVENT<|>GSV is a concept explored in the study that relates to the shared vision of sustainability within organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE GREEN CONFUSION (EGC)<|>EVENT<|>EGC refers to the confusion employees experience regarding the environmental characteristics of company products or services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (EEP)<|>EVENT<|>EEP is a measure of how well employees perform in relation to environmental sustainability efforts within a company.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN PRODUCT PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP (GPPO)<|>EVENT<|>GPPO is a concept that describes the psychological ownership employees feel towards green products, influencing their environmental behavior.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY<|>TAIPEI<|>The National Defense University is located in Taipei, Taiwan, where the research was conducted<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL TAIPEI UNIVERSITY<|>TAIPEI<|>The National Taipei University is located in New Taipei City, which is part of the greater Taipei area<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN SHARED VISION (GSV)<|>EMPLOYEE GREEN CONFUSION (EGC)<|>GSV is explored in relation to how it affects EGC among employees<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN SHARED VISION (GSV)<|>EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (EEP)<|>GSV is linked to improving EEP as part of corporate sustainability efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN SHARED VISION (GSV)<|>GREEN PRODUCT PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP (GPPO)<|>GSV positively affects GPPO, influencing employee behavior towards sustainability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPLOYEE GREEN CONFUSION (EGC)<|>EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (EEP)<|>EGC negatively impacts EEP, highlighting the importance of clarity in environmental messaging<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN PRODUCT PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP (GPPO)<|>EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (EEP)<|>GPPO influences EEP, as employees who feel ownership over green products perform better environmentally<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
