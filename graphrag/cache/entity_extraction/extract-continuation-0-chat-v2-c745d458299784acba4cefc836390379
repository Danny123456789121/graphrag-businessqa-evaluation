In line with Suchman, we define legitimacy as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of Bangladeshi banks are appropriate within the norms created by the regulator Bangladesh Bank. Related research found that legitimacy-based sustainability activities of firms are reactions to external pressure [70]. The emphasis here lies on reactive, meaning that corporations do not engage in sustainability activities as a proactive way to increase their business performance but as a reaction to stakeholder pressure or events. Consequently, activities decrease when pressure decreases [71].\n\nAnother implication based on legitimacy theory is that bigger institutions are more exposed to public pressure and therefore react more strongly [72]. In our study, we assume that bigger banks are more exposed to the influence of the public, including the regulator. Consequently, they conduct sustainability activities because of self-interest and normative approval [20]. Finally, in line with legitimacy theory, we hypothesize that banks report more about the environment than about social issues because the ERM mainly addresses environmental sustainability.\n\nSustainability activities triggered by legitimacy concerns, however, are not stable and do not address the core strategies and activities of banks but try to satisfy stakeholders. Therefore, we hypothesize that banks do not increase their sustainability activities even if they were able to improve their financial performance because of their sustainability activities. Hence, they do not follow a strategic corporate sustainability approach [73].\n\nTo summarize, our main hypotheses are (1) that Bangladeshi banks are reactive with regard to their sustainability activities, (2) that bigger banks perform a stronger reaction than smaller banks, (3) that Bangladeshi banks mainly focus on the environmental aspect of sustainability, and (4) that the financial success of sustainability activities does not lead to increased activities in the following year.\n\n# 4. Materials and Methods\n\nWe analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are operating under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample was collected from publicly available reports, such as annual, sustainability, and CSR reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, as well as data published by the Bangladesh Bank. We conducted a document analysis using NVIVO software. The keywords are in line with similar studies [8,24] and are based on the criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative [74–76].\n\nThe sample consists of four types of banks, state-owned commercial banks (SOB), specialized development banks (SDB), private commercial banks (PCB), and foreign commercial banks (FCB) (see Table 1). Data was collected for the years between 2012 and 2016. The year 2016 was the year we found full disclosure for all banks in the sample at the time of gathering the data. The first year is the\n\nSustainability 2020, 12, 7999\n\nyear of the implementation of the ERM guides. Only 22 out of the 56 banks, however, have published any information related to environmental, social, and sustainability aspects.\n\n# Table 1.
