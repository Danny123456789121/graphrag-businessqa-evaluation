This process involves an increasing population in urban areas, which has shown differential changes among income groups from 1975 to 2005. Urbanization is often associated with economic development and changes in lifestyle, leading to higher energy consumption and emissions. It serves as a critical variable in energy use models that evaluate the relationship between urban development and energy consumption, highlighting how urbanization affects energy use and emissions across different income groups. Additionally, urbanization is linked to higher CO2 emissions due to the industrial and service activities that typically flourish in urban settings.\",13\r\n9374,ENERGY USE,\"Energy use refers to the consumption of energy resources and is influenced by various factors, including population size, GDP per capita, economic structure, urbanization, and population density. The analysis of energy use often considers its relationship with urbanization and its effects on CO2 emissions, highlighting the interconnectedness of energy consumption patterns and environmental impacts.\",9\r\n9417,ECONOMIC STRUCTURE,\"Economic structure refers to the composition of an economy, including the share of industrial and service sectors, which affects energy consumption.\",1\r\n9416,POPULATION GROWTH,\"Population growth is the increase in the number of individuals in a population, which has a significant impact on energy consumption and emissions.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2179,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,URBANIZATION,The journal Ecological Economics publishes research articles that analyze the impacts of urbanization on ecological and economic systems,31\r\n4049,CO2 EMISSIONS,URBANIZATION,Urbanization often leads to increased CO2 emissions due to higher energy consumption in densely populated areas,31\r\n9293,URBANIZATION,ENERGY USE MODELS,Urbanization is a critical variable in the energy use models that impacts energy consumption trends,30\r\n9296,URBANIZATION,CO2 EMISSION MODELS,Urbanization is a variable included in the CO2 emission models to evaluate its effect on emissions,29\r\n4047,CO2 EMISSIONS,ENERGY USE,\"CO2 emissions and energy use are closely interconnected, as higher energy consumption generally leads to increased CO2 emissions.

This trend is associated with the HIGH-INCOME GROUP, where urbanization leads to increased energy use.

For middle- and high-income groups, urbanization tends to enhance energy consumption patterns, likely due to increased access to energy resources and higher living standards. Conversely, in low-income groups, urbanization negatively impacts energy use, potentially due to limited access to energy services and resources.
