They may adopt defensive actions in response to these challenges, particularly in relation to carbon policy risks. Firms are analyzed for their carbon emissions and stock returns, especially those in the largest quartile of emissions as of 2014. They are also affected by climate policies set by the governing parties in their respective states and are subject to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), particularly those that emit carbon.\n\nAdditionally, firms generate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) news, often announcing both positive and negative developments related to their operations. They may implement sustainable resource management practices and engage in various environmental strategies to enhance their performance and reputation. Furthermore, firms are involved in discussions around corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP), and they may be analyzed in the context of shareholder activism, particularly regarding gender diversity and board representation.\n\nThe firms included in the analysis of the carbon premium are those that have received carbon emission allowances under the EU ETS, and they are also examined for their sensitivity to temperature variations. Overall, firms play a crucial role in the intersection of economic activities and environmental initiatives, navigating the complexities of sustainability in their operations.\",62\r\n1413,CONTROL GROUP,\"The \"\"CONTROL GROUP\"\" refers to a group of subjects or firms that are not exposed to the treatment or intervention being tested in a study.
