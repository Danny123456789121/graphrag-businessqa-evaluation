This risk includes uncertainties and variability in returns that can arise from various internal and external factors. Additionally, firm risk can be influenced by corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, which may affect the financial performance and overall risk profile of the company. Overall, firm risk encompasses a broad range of potential challenges that a firm must navigate to maintain its operational integrity and financial health.\",4\r\n119,FIRM SIZE,\"\"\"FIRM SIZE\"\" is a significant variable that influences various business practices and outcomes, including management performance and corporate social responsibility. It is commonly defined as the log of total assets, which serves as a control variable in analyses, particularly in the context of shareholder activism and female board representation. Additionally, firm size can be measured through various metrics such as total revenue, number of employees, or market capitalization. In regression analyses, firm size is utilized to identify matched control firms based on their size in relation to targeted firms, highlighting its importance in understanding the scale of a company and its potential impact on corporate performance.\",12\r\n726,PROFITABILITY,\"Profitability is a crucial financial metric that indicates the degree to which a company or business activity yields profit or financial gain. It serves as a control variable in regression analysis, particularly in studies examining its impact on female board representation. Profitability is often assessed through various measures, including return-on-assets, which is defined as income before extraordinary items divided by total assets. This measure is significant in evaluating a company's financial performance and is frequently analyzed in relation to board diversity and governance.\n\nIn the context of corporate governance, profitability is not only a key variable in logistic regression models but also plays a vital role in shareholder activism. It reflects a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity, making it an essential aspect of financial performance analysis. Overall, profitability encompasses multiple dimensions of a company's financial health and its implications for governance and representation within corporate structures.\",6\r\n6652,FIRM LEVERAGE,\"Firm leverage refers to the extent to which a company utilizes borrowed funds to finance its operations and assets. It is expressed as a ratio of debt to equity, highlighting the amount of debt a firm employs in relation to its equity. This financial metric plays a crucial role in determining a company's financial stability and risk profile, as higher levels of leverage can increase financial risk while potentially enhancing returns.
