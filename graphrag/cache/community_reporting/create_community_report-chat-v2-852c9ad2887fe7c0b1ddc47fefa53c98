This system is designed to help the EU meet its climate goals by capping total emissions and allowing market mechanisms to drive compliance. The ECX's operations are essential for maintaining liquidity in the carbon market, which in turn influences the pricing of carbon allowances and the overall effectiveness of emissions reduction efforts in Europe.

The EU ETS sets a cap on total emissions, and the trading of EUAs through the ECX allows companies to buy and sell allowances to comply with this cap. This mechanism is essential for driving down greenhouse gas emissions across the EU, making the ECX a key player in the region's climate strategy.
