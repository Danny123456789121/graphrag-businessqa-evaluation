This model serves as an extension of the traditional CAPM by incorporating the tracking of portfolio returns in relation to shifts in expectations about temperature changes. By doing so, CAPM+TSF aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of how environmental factors, specifically temperature variations, can influence financial performance and investment strategies.\",2\r\n139,TABLE 2,\"Table 2 is a comprehensive resource that presents a variety of findings and analyses related to corporate sustainability and its implications in different contexts. It includes a distribution of articles across various journals that focus on corporate sustainability, providing insights into the academic landscape surrounding this topic. Additionally, Table 2 summarizes alternative frames on corporate sustainability, highlighting key rationales and references that inform the discourse.\n\nFurthermore, Table 2 details findings regarding shareholder support for proposals aimed at enhancing board diversity, indicating a growing interest in inclusive governance practices. It also features a meta-analytic correlation matrix that illustrates the relationships between various board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR), offering a nuanced understanding of how governance structures impact CSR initiatives.\n\nMoreover, Table 2 presents primary results related to the construction of the temperature shock factor and its implications for asset pricing models, emphasizing the intersection of environmental factors and financial performance. It also discusses the moderating effects of different measurement strategies on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP), shedding light on how measurement approaches can influence outcomes in this area. Lastly, Table 2 provides results for the primary specification of risk premia in relation to temperature and asset returns, further linking environmental considerations to financial metrics.
