They have specifically examined the relationship between board independence and corporate social disclosures, providing valuable insights into how governance structures can influence corporate social responsibility practices.\",2\r\n8048,CORPORATE SOCIAL DISCLOSURES,\"Corporate social disclosures (CSD) are communications made by corporations and organizations that provide information about their economic, social, and environmental impacts, as well as their policies and practices. These disclosures encompass reports that detail a company's governance practices and ethical considerations, aimed at informing stakeholders about the organization's activities and their implications. The study investigates the determinants of CSD, highlighting the importance of transparency in reporting a company's social and environmental impacts and practices.\",24\r\n8059,RAZAK AND MUSTAPHA,\"Razak and Mustapha are researchers who have made significant contributions to the study of corporate social disclosures (CSD). In their 2013 research, they found an insignificant negative relationship between CEO duality and CSD, indicating that having the CEO also serve as the chairperson of the board does not adversely affect corporate social disclosures. Additionally, they identified a significant impact of managerial ownership on CSD, suggesting that the level of ownership held by managers plays a crucial role in influencing the extent of corporate social disclosures. Furthermore, Razak and Mustapha explored the relationship between board size and CSD, contributing to the understanding of how board composition affects corporate transparency. They also suggested that board independence does not have a significant impact on corporate social disclosures, indicating that the presence of independent directors may not necessarily enhance the quality or quantity of disclosures made by corporations. Overall, Razak and Mustapha's research provides valuable insights into the factors influencing corporate social disclosures in the context of managerial ownership, board size, and independence.\",3\r\n8098,RASHID AND LODH,\"Rashid and Lodh are researchers noted for their contributions to the study of managerial ownership and its effects on corporate social disclosures (CSD).
