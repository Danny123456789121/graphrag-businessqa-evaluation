These states are characterized by their promotion of various climate policies, which may include more stringent regulations aimed at addressing climate change. As a result, firms operating in these states may experience increased exposure to temperature shocks due to the differing climate policies implemented. Overall, Democrat states are recognized for their commitment to environmental issues, which can influence the temperature sensitivity of businesses within their jurisdictions.\",5\r\n7036,REPUBLICAN STATES,\"The \"\"Republican States\"\" refer to regions in the United States that are governed by the Republican Party. These states advocate for specific climate policies that may influence how firms within their jurisdictions are exposed to temperature shocks. Compared to states governed by the Democratic Party, Republican states may implement different climate policies and exhibit varying responses to temperature fluctuations. This distinction highlights the potential for divergent approaches to environmental challenges and their implications for businesses operating in these regions.\",5\r\n7026,SIZE-VALUE PORTFOLIOS,\"Size-value portfolios are investment strategies that categorize stocks based on their size and value characteristics. These portfolios are designed to analyze the impacts of various factors, including temperature shocks, on the performance of different firms. By focusing on stocks of varying sizes and value attributes, size-value portfolios are commonly utilized in empirical asset pricing studies to better understand market dynamics and investment opportunities.\",9\r\n7104,ALPHA,\"ALPHA is a financial metric that measures the active return on an investment compared to a market index, serving as a key indicator of portfolio performance. It is utilized in various contexts, including the analysis of firm performance across different political environments. Additionally, ALPHA refers to the average absolute value of the intercepts in regression analysis, which further indicates the performance of an investment relative to a benchmark. Overall, ALPHA provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of investment strategies and their relative success in achieving returns above market averages.\",1\r\n7179,CLIMATE SENSITIVITY,\"Climate sensitivity refers to the degree to which temperature changes impact firms, particularly concerning the political climate and regulatory environment across various states.
