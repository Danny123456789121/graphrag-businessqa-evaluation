This process involves an increasing population in urban areas, which has shown differential changes among income groups from 1975 to 2005. Urbanization is often associated with economic development and changes in lifestyle, leading to higher energy consumption and emissions. It serves as a critical variable in energy use models that evaluate the relationship between urban development and energy consumption, highlighting how urbanization affects energy use and emissions across different income groups. Additionally, urbanization is linked to higher CO2 emissions due to the industrial and service activities that typically flourish in urban settings.\",13\r\n1122,CO2 EMISSIONS,\"CO2 emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, primarily resulting from activities such as electricity and heat production, transportation, and industrial processes. These emissions are closely linked to energy consumption and urbanization, making them a significant concern in environmental studies. The levels of CO2 emissions can vary significantly among different income groups over time, highlighting the disparities in energy use and consumption patterns. Overall, CO2 emissions are a critical factor in understanding the impact of human activities on climate change and the environment.\",11\r\n8400,ENERGY USE,\"Energy use refers to the consumption of energy resources and is influenced by various factors, including population size, GDP per capita, economic structure, urbanization, and population density.
