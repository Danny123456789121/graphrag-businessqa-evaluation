CSR encompasses a wide range of initiatives aimed at assessing and addressing the effects of corporate actions on environmental and social well-being.\n\nThe concept of CSR involves integrating social and environmental concerns into business operations and interactions with stakeholders, thereby promoting accountability to the public and stakeholders alike.

Furthermore, CSR is linked to managing sustainability paradoxes and includes dimensions such as human rights and environmental practices in supplier selection.\n\nOverall, CSR represents a commitment by corporations to positively influence the world, addressing social, environmental, and economic aspects, and is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in achieving long-term business success.\",227\r\n5645,INNOVATION CAPACITY,\"Innovation capacity refers to the ability of a firm to develop new ideas, products, or services, and to improve existing ones.
