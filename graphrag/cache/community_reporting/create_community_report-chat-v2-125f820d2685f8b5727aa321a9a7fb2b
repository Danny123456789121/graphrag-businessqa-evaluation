Ullmann is a prominent researcher recognized for their significant contributions to the understanding of the relationships between Corporate Social Performance (CSP), Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), and environmental performance within organizational studies. In 1985, Ullmann conducted a pivotal study that focused on the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and CFP, analyzing a sample of 24 studies. Throughout their work, Ullmann critically examined the interplay between social performance, social disclosure, and economic performance, emphasizing that voluntary disclosure should not be viewed as a reliable proxy for CSP performance.\n\nUllmann's research has highlighted the contingent nature of CSR returns in relation to financial performance, indicating that the outcomes of CSR initiatives can vary significantly. Additionally, Ullmann summarized findings from multiple studies on CSR and financial performance, revealing a lack of consensus in the results, which underscores the complexity of these relationships.

The following year, in 1995, Simerly conducted another t-test, this time analyzing return (R) and return on equity (ROE).
