These emissions are closely linked to energy consumption and urbanization, making them a significant concern in environmental studies. The impact of CO2 emissions varies significantly among different income groups over time, highlighting disparities in energy use and environmental responsibility. Furthermore, CO2 emissions are a critical factor in climate change discussions and are increasingly monitored by investors due to their potential influence on stock returns. Overall, the analysis of CO2 emissions encompasses their total output from fuel combustion and their relationship with energy consumption and urban development.\",18\r\n1318,CARBON RISK PREMIUM,\"The carbon risk premium refers to the additional return that investors may demand for holding stocks of companies with high CO2 emissions. This premium arises from the risks associated with carbon emissions and climate change, reflecting the potential financial impacts that these factors may have on companies' performance and valuations.
