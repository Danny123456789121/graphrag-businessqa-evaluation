It refers specifically to the inclination of journals to favor the publication of positive results over negative or inconclusive findings. This bias affects the overall representation of research, as researchers, reviewers, and editors may handle the reporting of research findings in a manner that does not accurately reflect all research conducted. Consequently, studies with significant results are more likely to be published than those with non-significant outcomes. This selective publication can distort the literature and impact the validity of meta-analyses, ultimately skewing the perception of research findings.\",6\r\n886,ROBUSTNESS CHECKS,\"ROBUSTNESS CHECKS refer to procedures employed to test the reliability and validity of results obtained from analyses. These checks are essential analyses conducted to confirm the dependability of a study's findings.
