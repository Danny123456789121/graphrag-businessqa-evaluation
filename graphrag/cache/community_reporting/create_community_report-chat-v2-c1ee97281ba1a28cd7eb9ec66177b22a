It represents the difference in performance between high book-to-market stocks (value stocks) and low book-to-market stocks (growth stocks). Specifically, HML is defined as the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on value stocks and short on growth stocks, reflecting the investment strategies that capitalize on the additional returns associated with value stocks over their growth counterparts. This factor is integral to asset pricing models, including the Fama-French model, where it serves to measure the excess returns of value stocks compared to growth stocks. Overall, HML is a crucial component in financial analysis, particularly in evaluating the performance of different stock portfolios.\",11\r\n1030,MOM,\"MOM is a variable that indicates momentum in the context of financial performance, particularly in relation to carbon emissions. It represents a trading strategy that focuses on the tendency of stocks to persist in their performance direction, often analyzed through the lens of environmental impact. Specifically, MOM refers to the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on stocks that have performed well over the past 12 months and short on those that have underperformed during the same period. This strategy highlights the momentum factor, which measures the inclination of assets to continue following their performance trends. Overall, MOM encapsulates the concept of momentum as a strategy that involves investing in stocks with high returns over a specified timeframe, while also considering their associated emissions.\",9\r\n1173,SMB,\"SMB, which stands for Small Minus Big, is a variable used in financial analysis, particularly in the context of the Fama-French model. It represents the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on small-cap stocks and short on large-cap stocks, thereby highlighting size-based investment returns. SMB captures the additional or excess returns that small-cap stocks generate over large-cap stocks, making it relevant not only in investment strategies but also in studies related to carbon emissions.\",9\r\n7161,ADJ-R2,\"ADJ-R2 refers to the adjusted R-squared, a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It is specifically adjusted for the number of predictors used in the model, providing a more accurate assessment of the model's explanatory power compared to the regular R-squared. This adjustment helps to account for the potential overfitting that can occur when too many predictors are included, ensuring that the measure reflects the true explanatory capability of the independent variables.\",4\r\n4890,MKT,\"MKT refers to the market factor that represents the overall market return in financial models. It is a key component in evaluating the performance of firms, particularly in the context of climate sensitivity. MKT indicates the excess return of the market over the risk-free rate, serving as a benchmark for assessing the performance of investment portfolios. Overall, MKT encapsulates the essential role of market return in financial analysis and investment evaluation.\",6\r\n1029,FF MODEL,\"The FF model refers to the Fama-French model, which is used to explain stock returns based on size and value factors.\",2\r\n1028,SML,\"SML refers to the Small Minus Big factor, a financial metric used to compare the returns of small-cap stocks to large-cap stocks.\",2\r\n4891,IND,IND is a factor that represents industry-specific returns in financial models.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3444,HML,PANEL B,Panel B presents findings related to the HML variable in the context of growth rate in total emissions,68\r\n3455,MOM,PANEL B,Panel B discusses the MOM variable and its relevance to growth rate in total emissions,66\r\n3663,PANEL B,SMB,Panel B includes results concerning the SMB variable and its impact on growth rate in total emissions,66\r\n3699,PANEL B,ADJ-R2,Panel B reports the adjusted R-squared values to indicate the explanatory power of the regression models,61\r\n3263,CARBON EMISSIONS,MOM,\"MOM is analyzed to see how stock momentum relates to carbon emissions, suggesting a potential link between performance and emissions\",51\r\n3443,HML,PANEL A,Panel A presents findings related to the HML variable in the context of carbon emissions,44\r\n3454,MOM,PANEL A,Panel A discusses the MOM variable and its relevance to carbon emissions,42\r\n3643,PANEL A,SMB,Panel A includes results concerning the SMB variable and its impact on carbon emissions,42\r\n2384,TABLE 3,HML,HML is discussed in Table 3 as a factor in the regression analysis for financial portfolios,33\r\n2383,TABLE 3,SMB,SMB is discussed in Table 3 as a factor in the regression analysis for financial portfolios,31\r\n2382,TABLE 3,MKT,MKT is discussed in Table 3 as a factor in the regression analysis for financial portfolios,28\r\n3442,HML,MKTRF,\"MKTRF and HML are both metrics used to evaluate stock market performance, with HML being a component of the overall market return\",27\r\n3445,HML,PANEL C,Panel C presents findings related to the HML variable in the context of emission intensity,26\r\n3453,MOM,MKTRF,\"MKTRF and MOM are related as they both measure returns in the stock market, with MOM focusing on momentum strategies\",25\r\n3765,MKTRF,SMB,\"MKTRF and SMB are both metrics that assess different aspects of stock market returns, with SMB focusing on size-based performance\",25\r\n3452,MOM,COMPANY I,MOM is a variable that predicts the stock returns of Company I,24\r\n3456,MOM,PANEL C,Panel C discusses the MOM variable and its relevance to emission intensity,24\r\n3778,SMB,PANEL C,Panel C includes results concerning the SMB variable and its impact on emission intensity,24\r\n3448,HML,FAMA-FRENCH,Fama-French model incorporates HML as one of its key factors in explaining stock returns,23\r\n3780,SMB,FAMA-FRENCH,Fama-French model incorporates SMB as one of its key factors in explaining stock returns,21\r\n3440,HML,MOM,MOM can be influenced by the HML factor in investment strategies that consider momentum and value investing,20\r\n3447,HML,SMB,SMB and HML are both factors used in financial analysis to evaluate stock performance based on size and value,20\r\n3446,HML,MKT,HML is influenced by the overall market performance represented by MKT,17\r\n3449,HML,ADJ-R2,Adj-R2 is used to assess the explanatory power of the HML factor in regression models,15\r\n6688,MKT,SIZE-VALUE PORTFOLIOS,Size-value portfolios are compared against market returns to assess their performance,15\r\n3457,MOM,MKT,MOM is a factor that is affected by the overall market trends captured by MKT,15\r\n3779,SMB,MKT,\"MKT is the overall market factor that influences the performance of SMB, which measures small-cap stock returns\",15\r\n3781,SMB,ADJ-R2,Adj-R2 is used to assess the explanatory power of the SMB factor in regression models,13\r\n3441,HML,FF MODEL,\"The HML factor is a component of the Fama-French model, which incorporates multiple factors to explain stock returns\",13\r\n7758,TRACKING PORTFOLIO REGRESSIONS,ADJ-R2,Adjusted R-squared is used to assess the goodness of fit for the tracking portfolio regressions,11\r\n3450,SML,MOM,MOM strategies may also take into account the SML factor when assessing the performance of small versus large stocks,11\r\n6687,MKT,IND,IND is influenced by the overall market performance represented by MKT,7\r\n3451,SML,FF MODEL,\"The SML factor is another component of the Fama-French model, contributing to the understanding of stock performance\",4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
