It encompasses a firm's profitability, revenue, and overall financial health, typically evaluated using key indicators such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), profit margins, and sales growth. Financial performance is crucial for understanding how effectively a firm utilizes its assets to generate earnings and is frequently analyzed in relation to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and sustainability practices.\n\nIn the context of banks, financial performance reflects their profitability and financial health, which can be influenced by their sustainability practices.
