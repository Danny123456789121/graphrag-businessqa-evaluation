It is often discussed in various academic and practical contexts, including corporate practices and environmental policies. The term refers to the ability to maintain certain processes or states indefinitely, focusing on environmental, social, and economic dimensions. \n\nSustainability is also a field of study and practice dedicated to meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes managing resources in a way that balances ecological and social systems, often in the context of corporate responsibility and environmental management. \n\nIn addition to its theoretical aspects, sustainability is represented in various publications, including a journal that publishes research on sustainable practices, corporate social responsibility, and the environmental, cultural, economic, and social sustainability of human beings. This journal serves as a platform for knowledge creation and sharing, improving communication within organizations, and enhancing their reputation among stakeholders. \n\nOverall, sustainability integrates economic, environmental, and social considerations, aiming to create a balanced approach to resource management and societal development.\",79\r\n1346,MANAGERS,\"Managers are individuals responsible for making decisions and interpreting strategic issues within organizations.
