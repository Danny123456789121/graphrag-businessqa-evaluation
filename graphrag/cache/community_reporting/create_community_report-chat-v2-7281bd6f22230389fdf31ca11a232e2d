It represents the difference in performance between high book-to-market stocks (value stocks) and low book-to-market stocks (growth stocks). Specifically, HML is defined as the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on value stocks and short on growth stocks, reflecting the investment strategies that capitalize on the additional returns associated with value stocks over their growth counterparts. This factor is integral to asset pricing models, including the Fama-French model, where it serves to measure the excess returns of value stocks compared to growth stocks. Overall, HML is a crucial component in financial analysis, particularly in evaluating the performance of different stock portfolios.\",11\r\n1304,MOM,\"MOM is a variable that represents momentum in the context of financial performance, particularly in relation to stock prices and carbon emissions. It indicates the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on stocks that have performed well over the past 12 months and short on those that have underperformed during the same period. This reflects momentum strategies in trading, which are based on the tendency of stocks to continue in the same performance direction. MOM serves as a momentum factor, measuring the persistence of asset performance trends, and is associated with strategies that involve purchasing stocks with high returns over a specified timeframe.\",10\r\n1459,SMB,\"SMB, which stands for Small Minus Big, is a variable used in financial analysis, particularly in the context of the Fama-French model. It represents the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on small-cap stocks and short on large-cap stocks, thereby highlighting size-based investment returns. SMB captures the additional or excess returns that small-cap stocks generate over large-cap stocks, making it relevant not only in investment strategies but also in studies related to carbon emissions.\",9\r\n8173,ADJ-R2,\"ADJ-R2 refers to the adjusted R-squared, a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It is specifically adjusted for the number of predictors used in the model, providing a more accurate assessment of the model's explanatory power compared to the regular R-squared. This adjustment helps to account for the potential overfitting that can occur when too many predictors are included, ensuring that the measure reflects the true explanatory capability of the independent variables.\",4\r\n1464,IDIO VOL,\"IDIO VOL is a variable that represents idiosyncratic volatility, which is significant in the analysis of carbon emissions. It is defined as the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. This reflects the stock-specific risk associated with these investments, highlighting the importance of understanding individual stock performance in the context of broader market dynamics.\",4\r\n5671,MKT,\"MKT refers to the market factor that represents the overall market return in financial models. It is a key component in evaluating the performance of firms, particularly in the context of climate sensitivity. MKT indicates the excess return of the market over the risk-free rate, serving as a benchmark for assessing the performance of investment portfolios. Overall, MKT encapsulates the essential role of market return in financial analysis and investment evaluation.\",6\r\n1458,MKTRF,\"MKTRF represents the monthly return on the value-weighted stock
