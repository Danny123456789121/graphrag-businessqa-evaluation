It is assessed at year t-1 and serves as an important indicator of governance quality. The degree of board independence indicates how much the board of directors is free from the influence of the company’s management, which can significantly affect both corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (CSR). \n\nIn various analyses, board independence is recognized as a control variable that may influence female board representation. Additionally, studies have examined its association with corporate social disclosures, noting a positive but insignificant relationship. Overall, board independence is essential for ensuring effective governance and enhancing the integrity of corporate practices.\",13\r\n667,BOARD SIZE,\"Board Size refers to the total number of members on a company's board of directors. It is a significant factor in corporate governance, impacting the effectiveness of governance and decision-making processes. The size of the board is included in various analyses, serving as a control variable in regression studies that examine its effect on female board representation and its association with corporate social disclosures. Additionally, board size is investigated in relation to corporate social responsibility, highlighting its influence on governance practices and the overall effectiveness of corporate governance. Overall, board size plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics and effectiveness of a company's board.\",9\r\n641,CEO DUALITY,\"CEO Duality refers to the situation where the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also holds the position of chair of the board of directors. This dual role can significantly influence the governance structure of a corporation, impacting board independence and shareholder activism. CEO Duality is quantified as an indicator variable, which equals one if the CEO also serves as the chair of the board. \n\nThe concept of CEO Duality is also relevant in the context of corporate social disclosure (CSD), where it has been studied to understand its effects on corporate governance practices. In regression analyses, CEO Duality serves as a control variable, particularly in examining its relationship with female board representation. However, findings indicate that CEO Duality is generally insignificant concerning corporate social disclosures, although it may exhibit a negative association in certain contexts.
