Specifically, PANEL B details the dependent variable and various statistical measures related to the growth rate in total emissions, including the impact of the temperature shock factor during two sub-sample periods.\n\nAdditionally, PANEL B includes legacy sample data of carbon emissions from 2005 to 2017, concentrating on firms that existed prior to 2016. It provides the mean of the tracking portfolio return, supporting the hypothesis regarding risk premiums associated with temperature variation. The section also tracks portfolio regressions with alternative forecast horizons based on 10 industry portfolios, as well as regressions based on 10 industry-size and book-to-market portfolios.\n\nFurthermore, PANEL B reports the Fama and MacBeth two-pass OLS regressions using 55 size-value and industry portfolios as test assets, detailing the estimated risk premium and other relevant statistics. It also identifies the bottom 10 GIC 6 industries in terms of average emission production across scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 from 2005 to 2017. The results are broken down by investor category, illustrating how different types of institutional investors respond to carbon emissions in their portfolios.
