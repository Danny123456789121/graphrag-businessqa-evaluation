{"result": "Negativity bias is a psychological phenomenon characterized by the tendency for negative events and information to have a more significant impact on individuals than positive events and information. This principle suggests that negative experiences and negative information influence perceptions and decisions more profoundly than their positive counterparts. As a result, individuals may react more strongly to negative stimuli, leading to a skewed perception of reality where negativity is prioritized over positivity.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
