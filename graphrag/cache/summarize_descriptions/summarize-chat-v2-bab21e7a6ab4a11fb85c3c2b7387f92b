{"result": "META-ANALYSES refer to statistical analyses that combine the results of multiple scientific studies to derive conclusions about specific research questions. They serve as systematic reviews and aggregations of research studies, allowing researchers to draw generalizable conclusions across various fields. In particular, META-ANALYSES are utilized to assess the overall impact of sustainable finance practices and to evaluate the relationship between Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP). These analyses identify patterns and assess the overall effect size and significance of particular relationships or phenomena by aggregating findings from multiple studies. Ultimately, META-ANALYSES provide a comprehensive overview of findings in specific research areas, enhancing the understanding of complex relationships within the data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
