{"result": "SMB, which stands for Small Minus Big, is a variable used in financial analysis, particularly in the context of the Fama-French model. It represents the monthly return on a portfolio that is long on small-cap stocks and short on large-cap stocks, thereby highlighting size-based investment returns.
