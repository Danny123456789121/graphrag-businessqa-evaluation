{"result": "META-ANALYSES are statistical analyses that aggregate the results of multiple scientific studies to derive conclusions about specific research questions. They serve as comprehensive reviews that assess the overall impact of various practices, including sustainable finance, corporate social performance (CSP), and financial performance (CFP). By systematically reviewing and combining findings from numerous primary studies, meta-analyses identify patterns, discrepancies, and overall effects in research findings. They are particularly useful in evaluating relationships, such as those between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance, as well as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and CFP. Through this aggregation of research, meta-analyses provide a broader understanding of phenomena within specific research areas, allowing for generalizable conclusions across various fields.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
