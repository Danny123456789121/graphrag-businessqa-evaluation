{"result": "Haniffa and Cooke are researchers known for their contributions to the field of corporate governance. In their 2005 study, they found a negative and significant association between the presence of non-executive directors and corporate social disclosure (CSD). Additionally, they argued that stronger foreign ownership leads to increased geographic distance among owners, which may impact corporate governance dynamics. Their work highlights the complexities of ownership structures and their implications for corporate transparency and accountability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
