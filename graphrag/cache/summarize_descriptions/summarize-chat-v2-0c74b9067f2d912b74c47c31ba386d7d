{"result": "A \"WORKING PAPER\" is a type of academic publication that presents preliminary research findings intended for discussion and feedback. These papers are often subject to further review and revision before formal publication. They serve as a platform for researchers to share their studies and gather insights from peers. Notably, working papers are typically not yet peer-reviewed, which distinguishes them from finalized academic articles.\n\nIn the context of specific studies, a working paper was utilized by White to publish his research on CEP-related events in the United States from 1989 to 1992, while Yu published his own working paper on similar events from 2000 to 2007. Overall, working papers play a crucial role in the academic community by facilitating the exchange of ideas and fostering collaboration among researchers prior to the formal publication process.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
