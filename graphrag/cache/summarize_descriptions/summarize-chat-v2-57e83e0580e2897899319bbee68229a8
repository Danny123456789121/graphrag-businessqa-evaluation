{"result": "EFFECT SIZE is a quantitative measure that assesses the magnitude of a phenomenon, commonly utilized in statistical analyses and meta-analyses to summarize results and quantify the strength of relationships between variables across various studies. It serves as a crucial tool in research, particularly in evaluating the performance differences between socially responsible investing (SRI) and conventional funds. By providing a clear metric for the strength of relationships, EFFECT SIZE facilitates a better understanding of the impact of different variables in investment performance and other contexts.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
