{"result": "Green Shared Vision (GSV) is examined in relation to its impact on Employee Green Confusion (EGC) among employees. The findings indicate that GSV negatively influences EGC, suggesting that a clear and cohesive shared vision can effectively reduce confusion among employees regarding green initiatives.
