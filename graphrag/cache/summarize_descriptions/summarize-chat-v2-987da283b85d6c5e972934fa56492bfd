{"result": "Socially-motivated activists are individuals and organizations that engage in shareholder activism with a focus on promoting social values, particularly advocating for gender diversity on corporate boards. Their efforts are driven by social and ethical concerns rather than the pursuit of financial gains. These activists aim to influence corporate governance to reflect social issues, emphasizing the importance of gender diversity among board members. While they play a crucial role in advocating for these changes, it is noted that they may have less effectiveness in altering management behavior compared to other forms of activism that prioritize financial returns. Overall, socially-motivated activists represent a significant movement within shareholder activism, seeking to align corporate practices with broader social values.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
