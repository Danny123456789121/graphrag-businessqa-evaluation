{"result": "Table 5 is a comprehensive table in the document that presents a variety of analyses related to the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). It includes the results of moderating factors analysis, specifically focusing on the logistic regression analysis of target firm antecedents, which compares target and non-target firms while accounting for various controls and direct effects. Additionally, Table 5 details the logistic binary regression results concerning shareholder activism and presents the bootstrap test results that confirm the significance of mediation relationships.\n\nFurthermore, Table 5 examines the impact of temperature shocks on different portfolios and hypotheses, providing value-weighted annual impact estimates on the cost of equity capital attributed to these temperature shock factors. It also reports descriptive statistics that illustrate changes in the absolute value of effect sizes over the decades. Lastly, Table 5 includes results from robustness checks (Rob. 1.1 - Rob. 2.3), which detail the estimated annualized Greenium and its significance levels, thereby offering a thorough overview of the various analyses conducted within the study.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
