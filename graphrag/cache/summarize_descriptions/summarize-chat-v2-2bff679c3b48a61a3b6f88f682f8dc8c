{"result": "SCOPE 2 TOT is a variable that represents the total indirect emissions resulting from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling. It specifically refers to the total carbon emissions from these indirect sources related to energy consumption, measured in tons, for the years 2005 to 2017. This metric is crucial for understanding the environmental impact of a company's energy consumption, as it encompasses all indirect emissions associated with the energy that a company utilizes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
