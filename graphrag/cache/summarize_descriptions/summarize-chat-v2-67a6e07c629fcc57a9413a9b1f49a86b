{"result": "ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, refers to a set of criteria used to evaluate a company's ethical impact, sustainability practices, and overall corporate behavior. These criteria are essential for socially responsible investors who utilize them to screen potential investments, assessing how a company's operations align with ethical standards and societal expectations. ESG considerations are increasingly important in evaluating corporate performance, as they can significantly influence financial outcomes and stock performance. Additionally, ESG issues play a crucial role in the corporate social responsibility efforts of firms, particularly in the context of their impact on society and the environment.
