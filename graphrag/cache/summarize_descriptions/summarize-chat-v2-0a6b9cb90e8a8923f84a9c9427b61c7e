{"result": "TABLE 14 is a comprehensive table that estimates linear factor models applied to various portfolios. It reports results for different models, including the four-factor Carhart model and the three-factor Fama-French model. Additionally, TABLE 14 presents findings related to carbon emissions and stock returns over specific sub-periods, detailing the dependent variable and various statistical measures associated with these analyses. This table serves as a valuable resource for understanding the relationship between carbon emissions and stock performance, as well as the effectiveness of different financial models in capturing these dynamics.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
