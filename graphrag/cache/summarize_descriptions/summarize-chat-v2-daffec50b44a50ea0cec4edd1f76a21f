{"result": "Agency theory is a theoretical framework in economics and management that elucidates the relationship between principals, typically shareholders, and agents, such as company executives. This theory primarily focuses on the conflicts of interest that can arise when the interests of these two parties diverge. It highlights how agents may act in their own self-interest, potentially at the expense of the financial performance and overall objectives of the principals. Agency theory is particularly relevant in the context of corporate governance, as it provides insights into the dynamics between management and shareholders. Additionally, it serves as a management perspective that can be applied to various issues, including corporate social responsibility (CSR). Overall, agency theory is essential for understanding the complexities of principal-agent relationships and the implications of these dynamics in business settings.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
