{"result": "Meta-analysis involves the calculation and analysis of effect sizes to understand the strength of relationships across various studies. Effect sizes serve as a summary measure within the meta-analysis, providing insights into the magnitude of relationships identified in the research. Through this process, researchers can synthesize findings from multiple studies, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects being examined.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
