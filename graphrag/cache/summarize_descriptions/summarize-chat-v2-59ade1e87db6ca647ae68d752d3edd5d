{"result": "Bosch et al. are a group of authors who conducted significant research in the field of economics, particularly focusing on market reactions to events related to the Comprehensive Environmental Policy (CEP). In their 1998 study published in Managerial and Decision Economics, they analyzed how these events influenced market behavior. Additionally, Bosch et al. empirically examined the enforcement actions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and assessed their impact on firm response strategies as well as stockholder wealth.
