{"result": "Corporate Sustainability (CS) encompasses a range of corporate activities and strategies aimed at achieving a balance among economic, environmental, and social dimensions to create long-term value for stakeholders. It involves business approaches that not only focus on generating shareholder value but also embrace opportunities and manage risks associated with economic, environmental, and social developments. \n\nAt its core, Corporate Sustainability is about meeting the needs of current stakeholders while ensuring the ability to meet future needs, aligning closely with the principles of sustainable development. This practice prioritizes the long-term viability of organizations by integrating social, environmental, and economic considerations into their operations. Companies committed to Corporate Sustainability adopt practices that ensure they operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, thereby contributing positively to society.\n\nFurthermore, Corporate Sustainability is characterized by the management of a company's impacts across these three dimensions, aiming for long-term viability and responsibility. It emphasizes the importance of conducting business in a way that does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, often requiring a careful balance of economic success with social and environmental stewardship.
