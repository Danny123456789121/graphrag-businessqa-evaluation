{"result": "Razak and Mustapha are researchers who have made significant contributions to the study of corporate social disclosures (CSD). In their 2013 research, they found an insignificant negative relationship between CEO duality and CSD, indicating that having the CEO also serve as the chairperson of the board does not adversely affect corporate social disclosures. Additionally, they identified a significant impact of managerial ownership on CSD, suggesting that the level of ownership held by managers plays a crucial role in influencing the extent of corporate social disclosures. Furthermore, Razak and Mustapha explored the relationship between board size and CSD, contributing to the understanding of how board composition affects corporate transparency. They also suggested that board independence does not have a significant impact on corporate social disclosures, indicating that the presence of independent directors may not necessarily enhance the quality or quantity of disclosures made by corporations. Overall, Razak and Mustapha's research provides valuable insights into the factors influencing corporate social disclosures in the context of managerial ownership, board size, and independence.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
