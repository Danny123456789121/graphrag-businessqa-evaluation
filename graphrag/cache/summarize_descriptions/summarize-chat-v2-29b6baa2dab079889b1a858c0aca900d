{"result": "Razak and Mustapha conducted research on corporate social disclosures, examining various factors that may influence these disclosures. Their findings suggest that board independence does not have a significant impact on corporate social disclosures. Additionally, they identified a significant negative association between managerial ownership and corporate social disclosures, indicating that higher levels of managerial ownership may lead to reduced transparency in social disclosures. Furthermore, their studies also explore the relationship between board size and corporate social disclosures, contributing to a broader understanding of how governance structures affect corporate social responsibility practices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
