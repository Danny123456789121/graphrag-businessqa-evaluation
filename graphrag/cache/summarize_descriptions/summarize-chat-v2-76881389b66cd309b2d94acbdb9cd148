{"result": "Signaling theory is a theoretical framework in economics and social sciences that elucidates how one party credibly conveys information about itself to another party. This concept is particularly relevant in contexts such as job markets and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. In the realm of CSR, signaling theory explains how firms can use signals to communicate their quality and intent to stakeholders, thereby revealing important attributes about themselves.
