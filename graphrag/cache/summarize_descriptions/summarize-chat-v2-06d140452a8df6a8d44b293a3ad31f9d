{"result": "META-ANALYSIS and EFFECT SIZE are closely interconnected concepts in research methodology. Effect size serves as a crucial component in meta-analysis, quantifying performance differences between various entities, such as socially responsible investment (SRI) funds and conventional funds. It is utilized to evaluate the strength of relationships across multiple studies, providing a key outcome measure that indicates the magnitude of these relationships. In the context of meta-analysis, effect sizes are calculated and analyzed to determine the impact of variables, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) on corporate financial performance (CFP). Overall, meta-analysis employs effect sizes to summarize and assess the results of numerous studies, allowing researchers to draw comprehensive conclusions about the overall impact of specific variables.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
