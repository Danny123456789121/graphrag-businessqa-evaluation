It involves the integration of social and environmental concerns into corporate practices and decision-making processes. CSR encompasses a wide range of initiatives aimed at benefiting society, which includes both social and environmental dimensions.\n\nThe concept of CSR encourages businesses to assess and take responsibility for their effects on social and environmental well-being.
