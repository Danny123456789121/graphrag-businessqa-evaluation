{"result": "The \"RISK PREMIUM\" is a financial concept that represents the return in excess of the risk-free rate of return that investors require as compensation for the risk associated with an investment. This premium is crucial for investors as it reflects the additional return expected from an investment above the risk-free rate, particularly in relation to various factors such as the temperature shock factor and the greenness factor.
