These institutions are involved in significant financial transactions and risk management, making them essential to the overall functioning of the financial landscape. Due to their size and interconnectedness, European SIFIs are subject to rigorous evaluations, including climate risk assessments and sustainability-oriented policies. This focus on climate risks reflects the growing recognition of the potential losses these institutions may face as a result of environmental factors, underscoring their importance not only in traditional financial metrics but also in the context of sustainability and risk management.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
