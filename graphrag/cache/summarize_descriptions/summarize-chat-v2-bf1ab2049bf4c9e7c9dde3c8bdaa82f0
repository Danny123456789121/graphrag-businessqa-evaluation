{"result": "The \"Cognitive Framing Perspective\" is a theoretical approach that explores the role of individual-level factors in managerial decision-making, particularly concerning sustainability. It examines how individuals interpret and respond to complex issues, such as sustainability, through their cognitive frames. This perspective highlights the influence of different cognitive frames on managerial decision-making and sensemaking processes, emphasizing how individual cognition shapes organizational actions in the context of sustainability challenges. Overall, the Cognitive Framing Perspective provides valuable insights into the interplay between individual cognition and organizational behavior in addressing sustainability issues.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
