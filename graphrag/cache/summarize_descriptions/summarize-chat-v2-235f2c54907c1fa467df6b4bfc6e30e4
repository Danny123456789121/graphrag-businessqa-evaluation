{"result": "The REFLECT model is a theoretical framework designed to provide insights into the dynamics of value co-creation and co-destruction within the hospitality ecosystem, particularly as influenced by the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in hospitality (HT) firms. This model categorizes research questions based on their focus and significance in the context of GAI applications, facilitating a deeper understanding of how these technologies impact stakeholder interactions and experiences. Furthermore, the REFLECT model encourages HT firms to adopt a holistic perspective on value creation, emphasizing the importance of addressing the diverse needs and experiences of stakeholders involved in the hospitality sector.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
