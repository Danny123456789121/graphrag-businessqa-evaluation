{"result": "The Carbon Premium is a financial concept that represents the additional return associated with carbon emissions, particularly in the context of investments in firms that emit carbon. It is defined as the CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio, indicating the excess return that carbon-emitting firms receive, largely due to the allocation of free carbon allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). \n\nThis premium reflects the market's response to climate-related risks, as investors expect higher returns for holding assets with greater carbon emissions. The Carbon Premium is characterized by the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of \"dirty\" firms—those with higher carbon emissions—over a portfolio of \"clean\" firms during specific periods, notably from November 2003 to March 2009. \n\nAdditionally, the Carbon Premium can be estimated through cross-sectional return regressions over various sample periods, such as from 2005 to 2017. It highlights the additional value or cost associated with carbon emissions, emphasizing the significant topic of sustainable finance and the growing importance of considering environmental factors in investment decisions. Overall, the Carbon Premium encapsulates the complex interplay between carbon emissions, investor expectations, and regulatory frameworks in the financial markets.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
