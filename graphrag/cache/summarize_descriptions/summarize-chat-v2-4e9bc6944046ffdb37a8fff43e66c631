{"result": "META-ANALYSIS and EFFECT SIZE are closely related concepts in research methodology. Effect size serves as a crucial component in meta-analysis, where it is utilized to quantify the performance differences between socially responsible investment (SRI) funds and conventional funds. Additionally, effect size acts as a key outcome measure within the meta-analysis framework, indicating the strength of relationships among the variables being studied. This dual role underscores the importance of effect size in providing a comprehensive understanding of the data analyzed in meta-analyses.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
