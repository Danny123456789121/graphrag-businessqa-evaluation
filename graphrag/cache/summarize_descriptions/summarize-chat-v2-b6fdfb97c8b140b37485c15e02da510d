{"result": "A Confidence Interval is a statistical range of values that is used to estimate the true value of a population parameter. It is often employed in statistical analysis to provide an estimate of uncertainty regarding the results. Specifically, a confidence interval is likely to contain the true effect size or parameter being measured, thereby offering a range that reflects the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimate. This range is crucial for interpreting statistical results, as it helps to convey the reliability and precision of the estimates derived from the data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
