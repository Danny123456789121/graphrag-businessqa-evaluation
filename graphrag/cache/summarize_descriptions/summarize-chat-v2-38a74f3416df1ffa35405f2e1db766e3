{"result": "Institutional theory is a framework that investigates the impact of institutions on the behavior of organizations, particularly in relation to sustainability. It explores how institutional environments shape organizational actions and motivations, including the dynamics of shareholder activism. The theory emphasizes the role of established structures, norms, and routines as authoritative guidelines that govern social behavior within organizations.
