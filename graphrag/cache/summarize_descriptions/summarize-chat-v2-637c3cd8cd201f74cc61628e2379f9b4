{"result": "The \"SECOND-ORDER META-ANALYSIS\" is a sophisticated methodology that aggregates knowledge by combining multiple first-order meta-analyses. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of effects by statistically analyzing the results from various studies. It serves as a higher-level overview of the data, assessing overall trends and effects derived from the first-order meta-analyses. Proposed by Schmidt and Oh in 2013, second-order meta-analysis is designed to analyze existing meta-analyses, enabling researchers to draw broader conclusions about specific research topics.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
