{"result": "Lu and Abeysekera are researchers noted for their contributions to the study of corporate governance, particularly in the context of concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures (CSD). Their research highlights a negative association between concentrated ownership and the extent of corporate social disclosures, suggesting that higher levels of ownership concentration may hinder transparency in corporate social practices. Additionally, in 2014, they provided evidence indicating an insignificant positive relationship between auditor's credibility and corporate social disclosures, further exploring the dynamics of corporate accountability and the factors influencing CSD.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
