{"result": "Effect sizes are quantitative measures that assess the magnitude of a phenomenon or the strength of a relationship in research studies. They are commonly utilized in meta-analyses to summarize and compare the strength of relationships between variables across different studies. Effect sizes serve as statistical indicators that quantify the strength of a phenomenon or the impact of an event, making them essential in statistical analysis. Additionally, they are used to evaluate the relationship between sustainability performance and financial performance, highlighting their versatility in various research contexts. Overall, effect sizes play a crucial role in providing a clearer understanding of the relationships and impacts observed in research findings.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
