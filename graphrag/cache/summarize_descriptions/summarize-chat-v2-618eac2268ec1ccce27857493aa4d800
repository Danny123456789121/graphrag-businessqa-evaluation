{"result": "The \"PARADOXICAL FRAME\" is a cognitive perspective that recognizes and accommodates conflicting viewpoints, particularly in the context of decision-making related to sustainability. This conceptualization allows managers to navigate the interrelated yet contradictory nature of economic, environmental, and social concerns, rather than attempting to eliminate these conflicts. By embracing this cognitive approach, decision-makers can better understand and address the complexities inherent in sustainability issues. The paradoxical frame incorporates a combination of economic, environmental, and social attributes, which contributes to a higher level of complexity in decision-making processes. Ultimately, this framework leads to more comprehensive and informed decision-making by acknowledging the multifaceted and often conflicting aspects of sustainability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
