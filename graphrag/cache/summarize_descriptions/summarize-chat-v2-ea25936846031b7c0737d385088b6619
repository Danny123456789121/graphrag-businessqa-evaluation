{"result": "The \"FILE DRAWER PROBLEM\" refers to a bias in the publication process where studies that yield non-significant findings are less likely to be published. This phenomenon impacts the perceived effectiveness of research results, as it leads to an underrepresentation of studies with non-significant outcomes in the academic literature. Consequently, the file drawer problem can skew the findings of meta-analyses, as these analyses may only include published studies that often report significant results, thereby misrepresenting the true state of research in a given field.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
