{"result": "SCOPE 3 INT refers to a category of emissions reporting that encompasses all indirect emissions occurring in a company's value chain, which includes both upstream and downstream emissions. This category is distinct from SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 emissions, which cover direct emissions and indirect emissions from purchased energy, respectively. SCOPE 3 INT is recognized as the third scope of carbon emissions measured in various studies, highlighting its importance in understanding a company's overall environmental impact. Additionally, Scope 3 Intensity specifically measures these indirect emissions relative to a unit of output or revenue, providing a metric for assessing the efficiency of emissions in relation to production or financial performance. Overall, SCOPE 3 INT captures the comprehensive range of indirect emissions that a company is responsible for throughout its entire value chain.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
