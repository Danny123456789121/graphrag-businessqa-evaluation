{"result": "SCOPE 2 INT refers to a specific category of emissions reporting within an organization, focusing on indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation of purchased energy. This includes emissions from electricity, steam, heating, and cooling that are consumed by the reporting company. SCOPE 2 INT is recognized as the second scope of carbon emissions measured in various studies, highlighting its importance in understanding an organization's overall environmental impact. Additionally, Scope 2 Intensity measures these indirect emissions per unit of output or revenue, providing a metric for evaluating the efficiency and sustainability of energy consumption within the organization. Overall, SCOPE 2 INT encompasses the indirect emissions related to purchased energy, which are crucial for comprehensive emissions reporting and management.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
