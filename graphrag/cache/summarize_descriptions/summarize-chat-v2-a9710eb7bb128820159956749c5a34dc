{"result": "META-ANALYSIS and EFFECT SIZE are closely related concepts in research methodology. Effect size serves as a critical component in meta-analyses, where it is utilized to summarize the strength of relationships and quantify performance differences between various entities, such as socially responsible investments (SRI) and conventional funds. In the context of meta-analysis, effect size is a key outcome measure that indicates the strength of relationships across multiple studies. The process of meta-analysis involves calculating effect sizes to assess the overall impact of a variable and to synthesize results from different studies, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence. Overall, effect size is essential for understanding the magnitude of effects and relationships in the context of meta-analytical research.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
