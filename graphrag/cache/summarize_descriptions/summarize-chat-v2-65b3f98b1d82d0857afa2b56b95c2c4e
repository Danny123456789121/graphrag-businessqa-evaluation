{"result": "Governance modes refer to the various approaches and frameworks utilized for managing and implementing sustainability policies and practices. These modes encompass a range of strategies, including centralized governance, which involves decision-making concentrated in a central authority; decentralized governance, where decision-making is distributed among various stakeholders; public-private partnerships that facilitate collaboration between government entities and private organizations; interactive governance, which emphasizes stakeholder engagement and collaboration; and self-regulation, where entities take initiative to govern their own practices without external enforcement. Together, these governance modes provide a comprehensive framework for addressing sustainability challenges through diverse management strategies.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
