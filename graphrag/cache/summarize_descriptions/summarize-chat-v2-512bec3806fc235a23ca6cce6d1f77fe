{"result": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a comprehensive business model that emphasizes a company's accountability to itself, its stakeholders, and the public. It encompasses a range of practices and policies aimed at fostering a positive influence on society and the environment. CSR initiatives involve assessing and taking responsibility for a company's effects on social and environmental well-being, integrating these concerns into operations and interactions with stakeholders.\n\nThe concept of CSR has been studied for over 30 years, highlighting the relationship between a corporation's social actions and its financial performance. Companies that adopt CSR practices not only aim to operate ethically but also seek to contribute to societal goals, which can enhance public perception and potentially influence shareholder wealth.
