{"result": "Effect sizes are quantitative measures that assess the magnitude of a phenomenon or the strength of a relationship in research studies. They are commonly utilized in meta-analyses to summarize and evaluate the strength of relationships between variables. Effect sizes serve as statistical measures that quantify the strength of a phenomenon or the impact of an event, providing valuable insights in various fields, including sustainability performance and financial performance. By offering a clear representation of the strength of relationships, effect sizes play a crucial role in the analysis and interpretation of research findings.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
