{"result": "The retail industry is a non-manufacturing sector that is significantly negatively affected by temperature shocks. It is characterized by low carbon-dioxide emissions, which suggests that while it may not contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, it is still vulnerable to the impacts of temperature changes. These temperature fluctuations can disrupt operations and consumer behavior, highlighting the industry's sensitivity to environmental conditions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
