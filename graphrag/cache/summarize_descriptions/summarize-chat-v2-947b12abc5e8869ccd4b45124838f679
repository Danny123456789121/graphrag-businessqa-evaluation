{"result": "R2, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that quantifies the proportion of variance in a dependent variable that is explained by one or more independent variables within a regression model. This measure provides insight into the effectiveness of the independent variables in predicting the dependent variable, indicating how well the model fits the data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
