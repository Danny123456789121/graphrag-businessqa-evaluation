{"result": "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are defined as businesses whose personnel numbers fall below certain limits. They play a crucial role in the economy, particularly in developing Asian countries, where they are recognized for their potential to gain a competitive advantage through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices. SMEs may differ from larger firms in terms of CSR visibility and decision-making preferences, often relying more heavily on CSR initiatives to secure necessary resource support and legitimacy from stakeholders.
