{"result": "ADJ-R2 refers to the adjusted R-squared, a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It is specifically adjusted for the number of predictors used in the model, providing a more accurate assessment of the model's explanatory power compared to the regular R-squared. This adjustment helps to account for the potential overfitting that can occur when too many predictors are included, ensuring that the measure reflects the true explanatory capability of the independent variables.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
