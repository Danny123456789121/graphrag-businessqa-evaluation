{"result": "\"PRIMARY STUDIES\" refer to original research studies that provide foundational data for meta-analyses. These individual research studies contribute essential evidence for statistical analysis and are crucial in deriving conclusions about various topics, including the CSP-CFP relationship and sustainable finance. Unlike reviews or meta-analyses, primary studies present original data and findings, which are analyzed in the context of research evaluations. They serve as the original sources from which data is extracted for first-order meta-analyses and vote-count studies, highlighting their importance in the research landscape.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
