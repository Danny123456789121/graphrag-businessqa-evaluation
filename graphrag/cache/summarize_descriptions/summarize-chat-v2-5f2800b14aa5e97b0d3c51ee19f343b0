{"result": "PANEL A provides a comprehensive overview of total emissions data across various variables, emphasizing their statistical significance. It includes the full sample data of carbon emissions from 2005 to 2017, detailing the impact of temperature shocks on the cost of equity capital. Specifically, PANEL A of Table 5 illustrates the total value-weighted impact of these temperature shocks, while also presenting results related to aggregate institutional ownership measures and their influence on investment decisions concerning carbon emissions. Furthermore, PANEL A analyzes the performance of tracking portfolios in response to temperature shocks, and reports on the top 10 GIC 6 industries based on average emission production across different scopes (scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3) during the specified period. Overall, PANEL A serves as a critical resource for understanding the interplay between temperature shocks and carbon emissions, as well as their implications for investment strategies.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
