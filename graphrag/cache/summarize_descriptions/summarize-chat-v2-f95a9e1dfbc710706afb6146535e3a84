{"result": "Construction is a high-exposure sector that is significantly impacted by temperature fluctuations. This industry is particularly vulnerable to temperature extremes, which can adversely affect labor productivity and project timelines. Studies have identified construction as having significant negative sensitivity to temperature shocks, highlighting its high exposure to climate risks. Overall, the construction industry is recognized for its susceptibility to temperature variations, making it a critical area of concern in the context of climate change.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
