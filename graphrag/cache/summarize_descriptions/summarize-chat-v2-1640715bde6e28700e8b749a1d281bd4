{"result": "Europe is a continent that is part of the developed markets and comprises many countries, each known for its diverse cultures and economies. It encompasses several advanced economies and has a significant number of empirical studies related to various financial and environmental topics. Notably, Europe has a lower share of positive results from ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) mutual funds compared to North America. This trend is reflected in the region's approach to ESG investing, where it also shows a lower share of positive outcomes.
