{"result": "FAIL-SAFE N is a statistical measure utilized to evaluate the robustness of results in research analyses, particularly in the context of meta-analyses. It serves to determine the number of studies with null results that would be necessary to invalidate the significance of an observed effect size. Additionally, FAIL-SAFE N is employed to assess publication bias, helping researchers understand the potential impact of unpublished studies on the overall findings.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
