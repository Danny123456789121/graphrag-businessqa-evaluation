{"result": "Hart and Ahuja are researchers who have developed theories concerning the long-term effects of corporate environmental performance (CEP) on financial performance (CFP). They suggest that CEP positively influences CFP, with this effect becoming evident after one year for accounting-based measures and after two years for market-based measures. Their work highlights the significance of environmental practices in enhancing a company's financial outcomes over time.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
