{"result": "The \"Carbon Premium\" is a financial concept that represents the additional return that investors expect for holding assets associated with carbon emissions. It is defined as the CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio, indicating the excess return of a portfolio of firms with higher carbon emissions (referred to as \"dirty\" firms) over a portfolio of firms with lower emissions (referred to as \"clean\" firms). This premium reflects the risks associated with climate change and the regulatory environment surrounding carbon emissions.\n\nThe Carbon Premium is particularly relevant in the context of sustainable finance, as it highlights the financial implications of carbon emissions on investment returns. It has been estimated through cross-sectional return regressions over specific periods, notably from 2005 to 2017, and is often analyzed in relation to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). \n\nWhile some descriptions suggest that the Carbon Premium is associated with higher carbon emissions, others indicate that it can also pertain to investments in companies with lower emissions, emphasizing the complexity of investor expectations in relation to carbon risk. Overall, the Carbon Premium encapsulates the additional returns that investors anticipate from carbon-emitting firms, reflecting both the risks and the evolving landscape of climate-related regulations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
