{"result": "Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are independent entities that operate outside of government influence, primarily focusing on social and environmental issues. They are typically non-profit groups that advocate for corporate sustainability and engage in private politics to influence firms' Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. NGOs play a significant role in reporting on ESG issues and publishing related news, which can shape media narratives and affect investor reactions.
