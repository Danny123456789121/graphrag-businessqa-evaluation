{"result": "The \"CREDIBILITY INTERVAL\" is a statistical concept primarily utilized in Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. It represents a range of values that is believed to contain the true parameter or effect size with a certain probability. This interval serves as an estimate of the uncertainty surrounding the effect size, thereby indicating the reliability of the results obtained from statistical analyses. Specifically, the credibility interval provides a statistical measure that delineates the range within which the true effect size is expected to lie, reflecting the confidence in the findings of a study.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
