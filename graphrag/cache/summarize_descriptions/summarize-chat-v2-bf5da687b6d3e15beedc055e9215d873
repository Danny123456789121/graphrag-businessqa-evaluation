{"result": "Figure 2 serves as a comprehensive visual representation encompassing multiple aspects of research and analysis related to the CEP–CFP relation. It illustrates funnel plots that are pertinent to this analysis, providing insights into the data distribution and potential biases. Additionally, Figure 2 presents the initial hierarchical causal graph derived from the AHP-DEMATEL method, which aids in understanding the relationships between various factors. Furthermore, it details the conceptual structure of Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), outlining the different levels of CSR activities that organizations can engage in. The figure also summarizes the effect sizes of the main results from a second-order meta-analysis, highlighting the significance of the findings. Lastly, it encapsulates the search steps and strategies employed in a systematic literature review focused on organizational capabilities and sustainability, thereby offering a holistic view of the interconnected themes presented in the research.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
