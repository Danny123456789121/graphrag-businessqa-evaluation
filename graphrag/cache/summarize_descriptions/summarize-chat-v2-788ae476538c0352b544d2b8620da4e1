{"result": "Meta-analyses and primary studies are interconnected components of research that contribute to understanding sustainable finance. Meta-analyses aggregate data from multiple primary studies to derive overall conclusions regarding effect sizes and relationships. These primary studies serve as the foundational data sources that are analyzed within the meta-analyses, allowing researchers to draw comprehensive conclusions about sustainable finance based on the combined findings of various individual studies. Through this process, meta-analyses enhance the understanding of the effects and relationships identified in the primary studies, ultimately providing a more robust perspective on the topic.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
