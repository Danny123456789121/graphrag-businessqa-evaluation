{"result": "Small firms are businesses that are independently owned and operated, characterized by a limited number of employees and lower revenue compared to larger firms. They typically have a limited market presence and resources, which often leads to them being analyzed separately in studies of environmental performance. In East Asia, small firms are particularly noted for their reliance on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a strategy to gain resources and enhance their competitiveness, setting them apart from larger firms.
