{"result": "ABNORMAL RETURNS and CUMULATIVE ABNORMAL RETURNS are both important metrics utilized to assess stock performance in the context of Corporate Event Performance (CEP)-related events. Abnormal returns represent the difference between the actual returns of a stock and the expected returns, serving as a critical element in the calculation of cumulative abnormal returns. Cumulative abnormal returns, in turn, measure the total impact of CEP-related events on stock prices over a specified period, providing a comprehensive view of how such events influence market behavior. Together, these metrics offer valuable insights into the effects of corporate events on stock performance.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
