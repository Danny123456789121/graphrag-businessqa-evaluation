{"result": "Value co-destruction refers to the phenomenon where personalized experiences result in negative outcomes for both customers and companies, leading to issues such as dissatisfaction or loss of trust. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of the hospitality and tourism (HT) industry, where the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) can lead to adverse effects for certain stakeholders. Specifically, the implementation of GAI may result in negative consequences such as job loss or resistance from employees, highlighting the potential for value co-destruction when GAI applications are not managed effectively. Overall, value co-destruction underscores the importance of careful management of GAI to prevent detrimental impacts on stakeholders.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
