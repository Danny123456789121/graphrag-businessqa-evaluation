{"result": "The terms \"META-ANALYSIS\" and \"SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\" are closely related in the context of research methodology. Sensitivity analysis serves as a crucial component of meta-analysis, specifically designed to evaluate the influence of outliers on the overall results. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is employed to assess the robustness of the findings derived from the meta-analysis, ensuring that the conclusions drawn are reliable and not unduly affected by any singular data points. Together, these analyses enhance the credibility and validity of the meta-analytic outcomes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
