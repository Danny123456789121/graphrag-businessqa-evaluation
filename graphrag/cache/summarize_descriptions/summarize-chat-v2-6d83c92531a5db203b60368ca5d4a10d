{"result": "M. Orlitzky, also known as Marc Orlitzky, is a prominent author and researcher recognized for his significant contributions to the field of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its implications for financial performance. His work critically examines the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP), challenging conventional wisdom regarding the net benefits of CSR. Orlitzky argues that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news may have adverse effects on stock market volatility.\n\nIn 2011, Orlitzky categorized various studies, providing valuable insights into different hypotheses and their statistical significance, which have continued to inform research in the field. His findings on the CSP-CFP relationship are frequently referenced in contemporary literature, underscoring their ongoing relevance. Additionally, he has authored a meta-analysis that explores the connection between CSP and CFP, further solidifying his role as a key figure in this area of research.
