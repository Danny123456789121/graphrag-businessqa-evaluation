{"result": "The term \"sample size\" refers to the number of observations or data points included in a study, which plays a critical role in determining the reliability and validity of the results. It encompasses the number of observations or replicates utilized in empirical analyses, and its adequacy is essential for ensuring the precision of the findings. A larger sample size can enhance the reliability of research outcomes, while a smaller sample may lead to less dependable results. Additionally, sample size is particularly important in the context of meta-analysis, where it can significantly influence the validity of the conclusions drawn. In studies related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), the sample size is analyzed for its impact on the results, underscoring its importance in research design and interpretation.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
