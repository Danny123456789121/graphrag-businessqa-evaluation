{"result": "SCHMIDT AND OH are researchers recognized for their significant contributions to the field of meta-analysis. They developed a method for second-order meta-analysis, which enhances the accuracy of effect size estimations. In addition, they introduced the artifact distribution approach, a technique utilized in meta-analyses to improve the reliability of findings. Their notable work includes a 2013 paper in which they proposed a novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis, specifically contributing to the academic inquiry into the relationship between Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP). Through these advancements, SCHMIDT AND OH have made a lasting impact on research methodologies in their field.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
