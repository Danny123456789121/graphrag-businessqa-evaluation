{"result": "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are defined as businesses with fewer than 500 employees. They play a crucial role in the economy, particularly in East Asia, where they may benefit significantly from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies. SMEs often differ from larger firms in terms of CSR visibility and decision-making preferences, relying more heavily on CSR practices to secure necessary resource support and legitimacy from stakeholders. This reliance is particularly important as many SMEs have faced bankruptcy due to the pandemic, highlighting their unique challenges in policy implementation. In developing Asian countries, SMEs are recognized for their potential to gain a competitive advantage through effective CSR practices, underscoring their importance in both the economic landscape and the broader context of sustainable business practices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
