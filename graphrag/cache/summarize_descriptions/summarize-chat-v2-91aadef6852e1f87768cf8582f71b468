{"result": "The term \"WORKING PAPER\" refers to a type of academic publication that presents preliminary research findings intended for discussion and feedback. These papers are often subject to further review and revision before formal publication. They serve as a platform for researchers to share their studies and gather insights from peers, which can enhance the quality of the final published work. \n\nWorking papers are typically not yet peer-reviewed, making them a preliminary version of scholarly research. They can cover a wide range of topics and are commonly used in various fields of study. For instance, one working paper published by White focused on CEP-related events in the United States from 1989 to 1992, while another by Yu examined similar events from 2000 to 2007. Overall, working papers play a crucial role in the academic community by facilitating early dissemination of research findings and fostering collaborative improvement of scholarly work.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
