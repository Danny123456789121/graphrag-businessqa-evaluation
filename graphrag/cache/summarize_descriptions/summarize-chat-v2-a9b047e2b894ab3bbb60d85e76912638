{"result": "Legitimacy theory is a framework that posits organizations must operate within societal norms to maintain their legitimacy and power. It suggests that companies actively seek to ensure their operations align with the bounds and expectations of their respective societies. This theory is particularly relevant in explaining how banks respond to institutional pressures and societal norms, especially concerning sustainability practices. In the context of Bangladeshi banks, legitimacy theory elucidates the motivations behind their adoption of sustainability strategies as a response to external pressures and societal expectations. Overall, legitimacy theory provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between organizations and the societal contexts in which they operate, highlighting the importance of aligning with societal norms to achieve legitimacy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
