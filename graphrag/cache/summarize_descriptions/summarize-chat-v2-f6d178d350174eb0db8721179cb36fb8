{"result": "\"PRIMARY STUDIES\" refers to individual research studies that serve as the foundational basis for meta-analyses, particularly in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance (CFP). These studies provide original data and findings, distinguishing them from reviews or secondary analyses. They contribute essential data for both vote-count analyses and meta-analyses, which are utilized to derive conclusions about sustainable finance and the relationship between corporate social performance and financial performance. Overall, primary studies are critical as they are the original research efforts from which data is extracted for first-order meta-analyses, thereby playing a vital role in the statistical analysis of CSR and its impact on financial outcomes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
