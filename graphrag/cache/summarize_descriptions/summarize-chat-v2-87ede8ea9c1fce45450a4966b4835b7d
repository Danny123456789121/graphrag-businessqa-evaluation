{"result": "Reactive Environmental Strategies refer to the approaches that organizations adopt in response to environmental issues after they have occurred. These strategies are primarily compliance-driven, aiming to meet legal requirements and address environmental challenges as they arise. Rather than taking proactive measures to prevent environmental problems, Reactive Environmental Strategies focus on implementing pollution control measures and other responses to mitigate the impact of environmental issues once they have been identified.
