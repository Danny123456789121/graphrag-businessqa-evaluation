It encompasses the inclusion of both male and female directors on corporate boards, with a particular focus on the representation of women. This diversity is believed to enhance monitoring and decision-making processes within organizations. Furthermore, board gender diversity is a subject of shareholder proposals and activism, reflecting its importance in influencing a company's reputation and engagement with social issues.
