{"result": "Lipsey & Wilson are a group of researchers recognized for their significant contributions to the field of meta-analysis. They developed a coding protocol specifically designed for extracting effect size and sample size information from studies, which has become a foundational methodology in this area of research. In 2001, they also discussed meta-regression analyses, further enhancing the understanding and application of meta-analytical techniques. Their work is frequently referenced in academic literature, highlighting their influence on methodologies related to effect size calculations and the overall conduct of meta-analyses.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
