{"result": "The term \"EFFECT SIZE\" refers to a quantitative measure that assesses the magnitude of a phenomenon or the strength of the relationship between variables in research studies. It is commonly utilized in meta-analyses to summarize results and evaluate the strength of relationships across various studies. Effect size serves as a statistical measure that quantifies how significant the relationships are, making it a crucial tool in the analysis of data.\n\nIn addition to its general application, effect size is discussed in specific contexts, such as investment performance, where it is used to compare performance differences between socially responsible investing (SRI) and conventional funds. Furthermore, it is also applied in examining the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business performance. Overall, effect size is an essential concept in statistical analysis, providing insights into the strength and significance of relationships in various fields of research.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
