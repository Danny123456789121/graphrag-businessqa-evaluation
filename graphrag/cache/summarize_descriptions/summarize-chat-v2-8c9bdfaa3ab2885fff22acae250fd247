{"result": "Productivity growth refers to the increase in the efficiency of production, often measured as the ratio of outputs to inputs in the economy. It has been a key driver of economic growth over the past decades. Specifically, productivity growth measures the increase in output per worker, and it is anticipated that generative AI will significantly influence this area through automation and efficiency improvements. Overall, productivity growth is expected to be enhanced by generative AI, leading to improved processes and greater production efficiency.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
