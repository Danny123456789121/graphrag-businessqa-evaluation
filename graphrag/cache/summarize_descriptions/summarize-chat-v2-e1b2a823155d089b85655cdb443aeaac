It measures a company's ability to manage its economic, social, and environmental responsibilities, assessing the impacts of its activities and the resources it utilizes on society and nature. This performance is particularly relevant for banks, as it reflects their efforts and results in implementing sustainable practices and policies, integrating environmental and social criteria into their operations and reporting. Furthermore, sustainability performance also considers the effectiveness of business practices in achieving sustainable development goals and the resultant impacts on financial performance.
