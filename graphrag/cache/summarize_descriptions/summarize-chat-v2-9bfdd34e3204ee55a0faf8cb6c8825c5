{"result": "The \"SECOND-ORDER META-ANALYSIS\" is a sophisticated methodology that aggregates knowledge by combining multiple first-order meta-analyses. This statistical analysis aims to derive a more comprehensive understanding of effects by analyzing the results of these first-order meta-analyses. By assessing overall trends and effects, second-order meta-analysis provides a higher-level overview of the data, allowing researchers to synthesize findings across a wide range of studies. Ultimately, it serves to enhance the understanding of a specific research topic by integrating insights from various first-order analyses.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
