{"result": "CARBON EMISSIONS encompass various measures that assess the impact of human activities on the environment, with SCOPE 2 INT being a specific metric within this framework. SCOPE 2 INT refers to the indirect carbon emissions resulting from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling. These emissions are a significant component of overall carbon emissions, as they arise from the energy consumed by an organization but are produced by external sources. Thus, SCOPE 2 emissions play a crucial role in the comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions, highlighting the importance of energy consumption in contributing to the total carbon footprint.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
