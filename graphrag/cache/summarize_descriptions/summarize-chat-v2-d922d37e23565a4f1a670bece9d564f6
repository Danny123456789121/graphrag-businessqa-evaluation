{"result": "Institutional theory is a framework that explores the significant impact of institutions on the behavior of organizations, particularly in relation to sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR). It examines how external social, political, and economic systems shape organizational legitimacy and influence practices and performance. The theory highlights the motivations behind shareholder activism and how institutional environments affect organizational behavior. \n\nFurthermore, institutional theory delves into the ways in which institutions establish structures, norms, and routines that serve as authoritative guidelines for social behavior within organizations. It is particularly relevant in the context of CSR practices, as it investigates how these practices are accepted across different cultural settings and in transitional economies, such as those in East Asia. Overall, institutional theory is a crucial component of sustainability literature, providing insights into how institutional structures drive corporate sustainability practices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
