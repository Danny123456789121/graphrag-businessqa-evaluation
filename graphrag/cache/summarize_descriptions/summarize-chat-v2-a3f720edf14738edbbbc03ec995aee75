{"result": "The term \"sample size\" refers to the number of observations or data points included in a study, which plays a critical role in determining the reliability and validity of the results. It encompasses the number of observations or replicates utilized in empirical analyses, and its adequacy can significantly influence the precision of the findings. A larger sample size generally enhances the reliability of research outcomes, while a smaller sample size may lead to less dependable results. Additionally, sample size is essential in the context of meta-analyses, as it pertains to the number of observations or replicates from the studies being analyzed, thereby affecting the overall validity of the meta-analysis results. In studies related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), the sample size is particularly important as it is analyzed concerning its impact on the results.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
