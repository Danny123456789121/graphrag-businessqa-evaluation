{"result": "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that is utilized to determine the expected return on an asset based on its risk in relation to the overall market. CAPM establishes a linear relationship between systematic risk and expected return, making it a crucial tool in finance for pricing risky securities and evaluating fund performance. By quantifying the relationship between an asset's risk and its expected return, CAPM aids in determining the cost of equity and is widely used in asset pricing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
