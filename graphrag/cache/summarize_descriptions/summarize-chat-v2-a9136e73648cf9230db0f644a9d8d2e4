{"result": "SCOPE 1 INT refers to the direct greenhouse gas emissions that originate from owned or controlled sources. This category of emissions is significant for institutional investors as they consider it when making investment decisions. SCOPE 1 INT represents the first scope of carbon emissions measured in studies, highlighting its importance in understanding environmental impact. Additionally, Scope 1 Intensity is a metric that measures these direct emissions in relation to a unit of output or revenue, providing a clearer picture of the emissions efficiency of an entity. Overall, SCOPE 1 INT encompasses the direct greenhouse gas emissions from controlled sources, which are critical for assessing both environmental performance and investment viability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
