{"result": "Social CSR refers to a company's initiatives aimed at improving social conditions and relationships, contributing positively to society, and addressing social issues through ethical behavior and community engagement. While it encompasses practices that promote social welfare, it is noted that in East Asia, Social CSR tends to be less impactful on firm performance compared to environmental CSR. This indicates that while organizations engage in corporate social responsibility practices focused on societal benefits, the emphasis on environmental initiatives may overshadow the importance of social initiatives in this region.
