{"result": "Board Independence is a critical measure that reflects the percentage of board members classified as independent, which plays a significant role in determining the governance structure of a company. It is assessed at year t-1 and serves as an important indicator of governance quality. The degree of board independence indicates how much the board of directors is free from the influence of the company’s management, which can significantly affect both corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (CSR). \n\nIn various analyses, board independence is recognized as a control variable that may influence female board representation. Additionally, studies have examined its association with corporate social disclosures, noting a positive but insignificant relationship.
