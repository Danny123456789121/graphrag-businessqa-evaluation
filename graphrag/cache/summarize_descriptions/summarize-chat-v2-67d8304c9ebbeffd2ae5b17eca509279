{"result": "The term \"EFFECT SIZE\" refers to a quantitative measure that assesses the magnitude of a phenomenon or the strength of the relationship between variables in research studies. It is commonly utilized in statistical analysis and meta-analyses to summarize results and evaluate the strength of relationships across various studies. Effect size is particularly relevant in contexts such as investment performance, where it can be used to compare performance differences between socially responsible investing (SRI) and conventional funds. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in assessing the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on corporate financial performance (CFP) and in examining the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP. Overall, effect size serves as a vital statistical tool for quantifying relationships and summarizing findings in research.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
