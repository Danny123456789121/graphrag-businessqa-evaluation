{"result": "Friedman refers to an influential economist and author who is recognized for his critical perspectives on the social responsibility of business organizations, particularly articulated in 1962. He is well-known for advocating the principle of shareholder wealth maximization, which emphasizes that the primary responsibility of a business is to its shareholders. Additionally, Friedman’s views have been referenced in discussions surrounding capital markets, particularly in the context of the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP).
