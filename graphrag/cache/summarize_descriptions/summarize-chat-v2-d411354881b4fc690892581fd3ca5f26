{"result": "The \"CREDIBILITY INTERVAL\" is a statistical concept that refers to a range of values believed to encompass the true parameter with a specified probability, commonly utilized in Bayesian statistics. It serves as an important tool in meta-analysis, where it indicates a range likely to contain the true effect size. Additionally, the credibility interval provides an estimate of the uncertainty surrounding the effect size, thereby reflecting the reliability of the results derived from the analysis.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
