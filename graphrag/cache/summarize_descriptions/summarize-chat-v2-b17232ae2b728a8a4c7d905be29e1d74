{"result": "AES, which stands for Average Effect Size, is a statistical measure used to quantify the magnitude of effects in research studies, particularly in the context of meta-analysis. It serves to summarize the impact of various factors across multiple studies, providing a coherent overview of the effects observed. In addition to Average Effect Size, AES can also refer to Adjusted Effect Size, which takes into account various factors in the analysis of effect sizes. This measure is particularly relevant in evaluating the performance of socially responsible investing (SRI) compared to conventional investments, as it helps to summarize the average magnitude of effects observed in such comparative studies. Overall, AES encompasses a range of metrics that are essential for understanding and quantifying research outcomes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
