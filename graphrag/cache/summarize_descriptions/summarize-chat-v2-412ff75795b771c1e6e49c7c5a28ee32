These returns are often analyzed in the context of event studies, which assess the impact of specific events—such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives or news announcements—on stock prices. Abnormal returns are particularly relevant in evaluating how certain events, including those related to corporate earnings performance (CEP), influence the performance of stocks, highlighting the discrepancies between actual and expected returns.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
