{"result": "Table 5 is a comprehensive table in the document that presents a variety of analyses related to the relationship between Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP). It includes the results of moderating factors analysis, specifically focusing on the logistic regression analysis of target firm antecedents, which compares target and non-target firms while considering various controls and direct effects. \n\nAdditionally, Table 5 provides descriptive statistics that highlight the strategic aspects of sustainable management activities. It also includes results from logistic binary regression concerning shareholder activism, as well as bootstrap test results that confirm the significance of mediation relationships. \n\nThe table further details moderator results for subsamples in the study, illustrating the impact of different accounting measures on the CSP-CFP relationship. It presents findings on the effects of temperature shocks on various portfolios and hypotheses, along with value-weighted annual impact estimates on the cost of equity capital attributed to temperature shock factors. \n\nMoreover, Table 5 reports descriptive statistics for changes in the absolute value of effect sizes over decades and includes results from robustness checks (Rob. 1.1 - Rob 2.3), which detail the estimated annualized Greenium and its significance levels. Overall, Table 5 serves as a critical resource for understanding the multifaceted analyses surrounding the CSP-CFP relationship and related factors.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
