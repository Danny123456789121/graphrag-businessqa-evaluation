# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy

Tim Orchard1 Leszek Tasiemski2

# Abstract

The aim of the paper is to analyse the likely implications of Generative AI (GAI) on various aspects of business and the economy. Amid the rapid growth and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve—from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may provide quality service—such as copy-writing—to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models—specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge. Not only the obvious expert-level data scientist roles but also low grade, “model supervisors”—people training the models, assessing the quality of responses given and handling escalations. Lastly new cybercrime risks emerging from the rise of GAI are discussed.

# Introduction

The aim of this article is to analyse the potential of business applications of the rapidly emerging Generative AI technology and the ongoing and foreseeable influence of it on the economy and various sectors of industry. Shortcomings and risks are also discussed—ranging from the technical, to legal and security and privacy matters. The authors believe that the discussed technology has recently reached a tipping point that will enable a rapid and broad adoption, possibly on a scale that can be called the next industrial revolution. Many indicators suggest that the maturity of AI technology is now past the tipping point of broad adoption in core value streams and critical processes.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 1 the concept of Generative AI is described along with historical background and limitations of today’s state of same. Section 2 discusses possible implications of GAI on the job market with both a creative and destructive potential. In Section 3 the GAI technology is analysed from the perspective of offering new, disruptive business models. Section 4 is dedicated to risks stemming from the use of GAI technology both by legitimate and by malicious actors. In Section 5 the legal implications of GAI are discussed.

# 1. The Generative AI (GAI)

The technology collectively called artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML), is a very broad term. It covers many kinds of computer science techniques where the algorithm (a model in AI terminology) is programmed in such a form, where a given task such as grouping of similar items or finding anomalies is achieved in a different way than an explicit procedure and exact matching to a human-defined pattern (Korzynski et al., 2023). Typically it would mean that during the process called training of the algorithm, the model automatically deduces the pattern and is able to generalize despite the lack of exact human-made rules.

# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy

As such these techniques are not new. They have been hypothesized as early as in the 1950s (Turing, 1950) or even 1940’s as “A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity” which was presented in 1943 by Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch. The first implementations of self-improving algorithms happened in the 1950s and 1960s. However, up until recently those algorithms were not mainstream mostly due to a lack of computing power which made them slow and less convenient than traditional, procedural algorithms.

In recent years an exponential growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology and its applications can be observed. GAI using usually very big models (GPT-4, released by OpenAI in 2023 uses 170 trillion parameters) trained on vast libraries of text, pictures and other inputs and is a technology capable of generating novel, “creative” content in response to an input (prompt). These algorithms can be interacted with using a natural language and typically are sophisticated statistical models. In most of the machine learning models knowledge is represented internally as a set of features. Features are parameters that are considered and calculated in the process of training the algorithm to achieve a sufficient level of generalization. Generalization is what makes AI models stand apart from the traditional, procedural approach. Such algorithms can respond correctly even to an input that was not part of the training set. Usually this is because the features of the model (parameters) allow recognition of a similar input with sufficient precision.

In general traditional machine learning models can be categorized into supervised learning where the model is trained upon a previously labelled set and unsupervised models that rely on the analysis and clustering of unlabelled data sets. Typical problems solved by the supervised approach are regression and classification. Unsupervised learning is typically used in problems of clustering or anomaly detection. Large Language Models (LLM), often used in GAI use a mix of the above approaches: semi-supervised or self-supervised learning. Exploring the details of the implementation of machine learning algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper.

# 1.1. Limitations—the lack of context, limited timespan of knowledge and hallucinations

Currently the biggest limitation of these models is a lack of what humans would call consciousness. Apart from a philosophical dispute on the definition of this term the implication is that the current models are not context aware and there is no reasoning based on the nature of the object being processed (Penrose, 1989). In a huge simplification—those models just extremely well

# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023

Predict which word should appear after the previous word in the context of a given session and user prompt (in ChatGPT). This means that when there is no exact “match” (the model lacks exact knowledge), it is likely to make it up very confidently which is now known as model “hallucinations”. The current mainstream models such as GPT-4 suffer from the timespan of the data they have been trained on. Upon training the engineers of the model funnel vast amounts of data into the model. In the case of GPT-4 it is about 45TB of data. After the training process is completed the model does not use any data that was not part of the training set. This means that the model is blind to any new knowledge or news that was produced after the training process of the model was concluded. This is a significant limitation of the current approach (Wach et al., 2023). Frequent training of such a big model is impractical and too expensive. The cost of GPT-4 model training was over $100 million according to OpenAI CEO. A new approach is needed where an additional orchestration layer would allow the merging of the output of a LLM with any needed on-line source of information. In practice it means that a combination of a LLM and what is now known as “search engine” into one tool is needed.

# 1.2. Limitations—the lack of “explainability”

Another limitation of today’s AI technology is “explainability”. Because the models generate an internal representation of objects using features and weightings that made them most relevant during the model training process even the engineer who has built the model does not know the inner logic in detail. The effect is that the models used are usually giving a very correct output but it is extremely hard to answer the question “how exactly was that result calculated?”. This may lead to a situation where just a slight alteration of the input—just a few pixels in case of picture recognition—may lead to a radical confusion of the model and alter the result dramatically. For instance, a small alteration can lead an artificial turtle to be recognized as a rifle (Hutson, 2018). Very slight modification to street signs may cause confusion to autonomous vehicle systems that recognize those signs and drive accordingly (IEEE, 2017). In a 2018 paper called “Automated classification of skin lesions: From pixels to practice” a group of scientists analysed how well AI models (classifiers, not GAI) coped with skin lesions (Narla et al., 2018). The AI model was performing exceptionally well in identifying malignant examples from the test set. What was discovered—because pictures of malignant lesions were more likely to also contain rulers, pens or other additional markings the model learned to identify them. In other words an image of a lesion would more likely be rec-

# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy

ognized as malignant if the analysed picture contained a ruler. Better “explainability” of the models, especially those used in areas such as medicine, cybersecurity & risk assessment or legal—will lead to better decision auditing and controlling possibilities and will help to overcome the psychological barriers in the broader adoption of those technologies.

# 1.3. Limitations—energy consumption and cost of training

One important factor is energy consumption and the computational cost of the training process of large AI models. While it is true that algorithms and data centre hardware are increasingly energy-efficient and more datacentres operate on renewable energy it needs to be stressed that the process of training a model is an expensive, data and processing hungry undertaking that requires massive amounts of energy to complete. For instance, the GPT-4 model by OpenAI, was trained on 45TB of data and over 170 trillion of parameters. It is estimated that the training process of the GPT-4 model consumed 7.5 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy. It is also estimated that another 8 MWh of energy annually will be used in the deployment of the model (the actual applications) (TS2, 2023).

Additional research effort is required to limit the amount of energy that is required for the model re-training. There are techniques being developed such as “transfer learning” that allow relevant parts of the previous model to be transferred to the new one, eliminating the need of the whole new model to be trained from scratch and therefore restricting the use of energy. Partial re-training of a model is an approach known and already used in neural networks and this approach may soon be feasible also in Large Language Models (LLMs).

More energy use apart from the possible environmental impact means cost. Sam Altman the CEO of OpenAI said that the cost of training GPT-4 was over $100 million (Wired, 2023). Given that the demand for better models with more up to date data is very likely to rise meaning more frequent model updates. The current approach does not seem viable even for the biggest tech companies and a new approach is needed. Some experts are of the opinion that a hybrid approach is likely to address the limitations of the current models. In such an approach as mentioned in the earlier section of this article the core LLM model would not be retrained as often but it would be capable of reaching out to on-line information available on the Internet to provide the most up to date content in its output. Such an approach is believed to be attempted by Google now with its Bard engine and by Microsoft in its GPT-powered Bing application.

# 2. Generative AI as a force changing the job market

# 2.1. New professions

New skills and eventually new professions will be needed to embrace the benefits from the GAI family of technologies. Already now the specific skill of interaction with Large Language Models (LLM) called prompt engineering is in growing demand. Prompt engineers understand the proper flow of the interaction with GAI models to get the best possible quality outcome from them.

Apart from prompt-engineering and other specialized data science and development jobs such as DataOps, MLOps that will be needed to create, tune, deploy, operate and supervise machine learning models in their massive deployment potentially many more new jobs and professions will be created by the adoption of GAI technology.

Currently GAI models and especially those which are language based (LLM) rely on the semi-supervised learning method for training and tuning the algorithm. In simple terms supervised models use a form of reward and punishment to help the algorithm properly adjust internal features (weights) to produce the best quality outcome. The reinforcement (positive and negative) come either from users, from another AI model or from a specific group of employees whose job is to interact with the model and “reward” good answers and “punish” incorrect ones in a digital way. Based on this the model can tweak itself and improve the quality. This process is not only about the correctness of the generated output. It is also—and perhaps more importantly—about making sure the model does not produce harmful outcomes. Examples of harmful outcomes would include hate speech, racial, gender and minority biases or these which instruct users on how to construct explosives, cause self-harm, violence, etc. Some readers may find it surprising or even shocking that an AI model produced by a trustworthy organization (OpenAI, e.g.) can so do but it should be remembered that these models are trained entirely on the content available on the Internet which has been created by humans. In 2016 Microsoft experimented with Tay and an AI chatbot for Twitter. Because in the foreseeable future humans will still contribute to the content of the Internet models will be influenced by this content and model supervision will be needed to make sure the LLMs do not amplify hate speech or similar undesirable features.

# 2.2. Professions possibly affected or replaced entirely by GAI

There are existing, traditional professions that are likely to be replaced entirely or to some extent by GAI technology. Media content creation seems to

# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy

be one of the industries where the human workforce seems to be already replaced by GAI. In December 2022 the BuzzFeed company cut 12% of its staff (180 people) and subsequently in January 2023 the company stated that it will extensively use AI technologies. One published memo says: “The creative process will increasingly become AI-assisted and technology-enabled” (Vincent, 2023). The company indicates that it will use tooling provided by OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT. In November 2022 Meta made a similar move removing the fifteen United Kingdom Facebook News curators and replacing them with an AI algorithm (Metaverse Post, 2022).

A report released in April 2023 by Goldman Sachs (Goldman Sachs, 2023) indicates that as many as 300 million full-time jobs will be subject to automation by Generative AI. The company analysed a set of over 900 occupations and concluded that roughly two thirds of occupations existing in the U.S. are to some degree exposed to automation as an effect of the implementation of AI technologies. In the same report the company estimates that only natural language generation technologies (which is a subset of GAI technologies) could drive a 7% increase of global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over the period of ten years (Goldman Sachs, 2023). It is worth remembering that such far-reaching estimations are done upon the technology that is still very early in its adoption cycle and we are only now starting to discover possible applications which either improve the productivity of humans or replace some of their tasks entirely. Any global economic predictions at this stage can be vastly underestimated. According to the EU Parliament’s Think Tank report from 2020, “14% of jobs in OECD countries are highly capable of automation and another 32% could face substantial changes” (European Parliament, 2020a; see also Michael, 2023).

While most of the recent tech industry lay-offs and restructuring projects cannot be attributed to GAI technologies it seems likely that software engineering will become one of the industries most heavily affected by GAI technology. In principle the creation of source code is to a large extent a repeatable act which is subject to optimization and refinement by application even of non-AI methods. Even currently available GAI tools such as ChatGPT can easily create a working code basing on instructions or descriptions given in the English natural language. Already now several companies offer GAI-powered automated source code generators. One of these products is GitHub Copilot (GitHub, 2023). The company promotes the product this way: “Spend less time creating boilerplate and repetitive code patterns and more time on what matters: building great software. Write a comment describing the logic you want and GitHub Copilot will immediately suggest a code to implement the solution” (GitHub, 2023). Apart from code generation tools providers also offer code completion tools—where the AI model predicts the next elements of the source code based on what the software engineer is typing. There is also a rise of code review solutions powered by GAI such as Amazon.

# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023

CodeWhisperer that look at the human-generated code and suggest optimizations, improvements or simplifications—to create a cleaner, more consistent, efficient and secure code. CodeWhisperer can also be used in code generation mode and is described thus:

It comprehends comments expressed in natural language, creates code based on the developer’s objectives and corresponds to the developer’s style and patterns. Additionally, while typing, CodeWhisperer offers suggestions to complete the comment. Users have the option to accept the top suggestion, view additional recommendations, or proceed with writing their own code. (Dilmegani, 2023)

Currently it seems likely that the professions that are required to compile and analyse huge sets of data are at particular risk of being automated by GAI technologies. This includes legal, para-legal, financial analysis and advisory branches. Because GAI models can be trained on complete sets of data and given the ability to consolidate information they are able to compile all available information (in the training set) to formulate a precise legal or financial recommendation. There are reports of ChatGPT passing law (scoring in the top 10%), medical or business examinations. As mentioned in the previous section of this article—depending on the business model and sophistication of the technology AI generated analysis can be considered either at the entry level or at a premium level when compared to a human-based service.

Another group of employees whose work is likely to be supplemented or replaced by AI technology are content creators and people working with customer support. Because GAI is becoming increasingly consistent, factually correct and fluent in content generation and interaction with humans it will be used to automatically generate media content (subject to be consumed by people and in many cases to boost advertising revenue of the medium publishing such content). Also the technology will soon improve the user experience in interaction-based areas such as customer support way beyond the basic chatbots that currently are used mainly in the first level of support and can only solve the most basic and well scripted issues. Very recently IKEA the well-known furniture and home decoration chain announced that it has retrained 8.500 customer support call centre workers to become “interior design advisors” while customer support duties are increasingly handled by their AI agent, “Billie”. The system has handled 47% of call centre inquiries over the past two years.

# 2.3. The summary of the expected impact

It can be assumed that the adoption of generative AI technologies will drive a structural change in the global job market. Within several years some profes-

# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy

sions may be partially or completely replaced by automation. In principle the more the profession relies on “data to consolidated output” flow, the more likely it is to be replaced by AI. This process started before the dawn of powerful GAI models a rapid acceleration is likely to be seen henceforward. On the other hand, it is certain that some of that impact will be compensated for by the demand for new professions, ranging from the extremely specialized to entry level. It is interesting to note that the jobs such as prompt engineer did not exist before the mass adoption of AI technologies.

# 3. Generative AI as a disruptive technology

There are multiple business models and approaches that allow emerging technologies such as GAI, to disrupt the market. One of the strategies to disrupt the market is to identify a segment occupied by companies that overserve customers and deliver a more basic—but still relevant—product or service at a lower price point (Christensen, 2016; Christensen & Raynor, 2013). In such a model technology and automation are the factors that make such a strategy still lucrative because of cost efficiency and rapid scalability. Cost efficiency and scalability usually result from minimizing the human work required in the value chain. Various tiers of a product or service is a typical mechanism used by companies to maximize the addressable market and increase efficiency of assets. Typically the highest tier on offer would be both resource and features-intensive and include most of the human-intensive service element for a premium price. This is typical of higher margin and lower volume products. On the other hand there would also be a lower tier of the offering. The lower tier is usually highly automated (or self-service) and offering only essential value and features. Efficiency and low cost are key here. The business model has lower margins but large scale. Usually companies use the lower tiers to expand the market and then upsell to more premium tiers. Typically there would be also some intermediate service tiers.

In many industries it is feasible to imagine the introduction of a lower tier of service that could be based mainly or entirely on GAI technology providing the core value at a lower price. Such examples may include legal, financial or medical advisory, media content creation, graphics design, copywriting, interior design, customer support, etc. Such services could use humans to operate and supervise the generated content. It is quite likely that the freemium business model can be utilized here, as the basic service can be offered free of charge (or generating revenue by featuring advertisements) while the elevation to a human service would trigger a payment. This way companies

# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023

could gain market share to then allow them to upsell from the GAI basic service to the premium that would be operated by humans. It is also possible to imagine specialized GAI models which are trained on specific domain knowledge data and which would specialize in some specific domain such as personal finance. In the disruptive technology model the company that currently serves its customers by offering personal finance advice at an enhanced price could now expand and offer a lower tier of such services at much lower prices and carrying a much lower cost and being able to scale better. The lower tier would be powered by a GAI engine. As The Economist (2023) also suggests GAI technology can be an efficiency booster by augmenting the human workforce. Harreis et al. (2023) in their article show how GAI technologies can be adapted in various aspects across the fashion industry value chain. In some cases GAI technology can be also used to accelerate the development of more junior staff and ensure the quality of their outcomes despite lacking experience and expert knowledge.

The above business model would only make sense under the assumption that human advisors would consistently provide better value with their service compared to the AI model. This assumption is currently valid. It should be remembered that even the best GAI models used today have a tendency to hallucinate and very confidently fabricate information when data is lacking in the model. However, when considering the pace of improvements in GAI technology and algorithms it can be assumed that in the near term the next generations of GAI models will consistently outperform humans. With that in mind it can be surmised that the GAI based service could be offered not only as a basic service but as a premium over what humans can provide. It is likely and technically feasible that knowledge operating companies such as business consultancy firms will invest in training their private, highly specialized GAI models. Such models would be trained on proprietary and confidential data. It is easy to imagine that such a model could become the most valuable asset of such a company. Taking forward the business consultancy firm example GAI technology could either support the consultants to produce the highest quality content in a reduced time (AI-assisted human consultancy or human-assisted AI consultancy). Consequently the service provided solely or augmented by such a specialized, proprietary GAI model would be a premium offering compared to a human-only consultancy.

While it is easy and comforting from the human perspective to imagine a GAI based service offered as a lower tier it can be a matter for concern when envisioning a human-based service as more basic and inferior compared to the GAI. Just as with all other technological revolutions a mental shift is needed in traditionally human operated businesses to embrace the technology and work with and not against it. The same is true for emerging AI technologies. Also as in previous technological revolutions it will take time until the initial wave of early adoption is conquered and a broader impact on the economy.

# The rise of Generative AI and possible effects on the economy

is seen as Krugman (2023) suggests. Kurzweil (2005) makes a point that the S-shaped paradigm lifecycle accelerates with each technological breakthrough thus shortening its adoption time.

# 4. The risks and misuses of Generative AI and influence on the economy

Generative AI technology can produce powerful tools with significant potential to assist in harmful activity if misused. So far all the known mainstream models are backed by organizations that are putting their reputation at stake in making sure their creations are not easily used to commit crimes or acts of terror. The widely available tools such as ChatGPT had to be artificially restricted before handing over to regular users to not instruct the users on how to construct a bomb or how to post hate speech on social media without triggering policy violation rules. Those are just two examples. Even then ChatGPT can be used to generate sophisticated phishing messages to conduct more effective phishing campaigns or generate social media responses to amplify any information (or disinformation) in a natural and convincing way. In other words “farms of trolls” used in disinformation and influence campaigns can be easily replaced by GAI technology. One of the studies confirmed that ChatGPT can be successfully utilized to produce phishing content, social validation and opposition and even producing fake news based on an offered prompt (Patel, 2023). This is possible with “responsibly trained” AI models. It is possible to think of all the applications of the models trained and used by malicious actors—be it nation states or criminal organizations.

Even without malicious intentions GAI will almost certainly lead to market consolidation among very few key commercial players who have the resources to keep building and operating even bigger and more capable models. Already now the LLM market is practically dominated by OpenAI and Google (Alphabet). This is the reason why some experts are calling for the creation of an international AI research centre to ensure more equal access and give an ethical angle to the research on even more powerful AI models. Some call it “the CERN approach” referring to the international efforts to advance research in particle physics.

Big AI models rely entirely on data. Both the data that is needed to train the model and then data (usually provided by end users) to tweak and improve it. While it is natural for data engineers that user-provided information may be utilized by the model not all users are aware of it. For instance, OpenAI

# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023

stated openly that user supplied data can be used to improve the product. It needs to be considered seriously before any sensitive information is fed into such model. While developers of the AI models are making deliberate effort to anonymize the training input it is possible—and happens in real life—that the model may leak some sensitive information that was used to train it. This is a very normal behaviour as the AI model does not recognize which portion of the data it was trained on is sensitive. When generating a response it sim- ply maximizes the probability (and reward) of rendering the proper output to given input prompt. That output may contain sensitive information. Some researchers successfully attempted to engineer the input in such a way as to make the model leak sensitive information. This activity is referred to as prompt hacking.

Yet another risk related to data is privacy. Various countries and regions (such as the European Union) have dramatically varying approaches to pri- vacy and human rights. In the countries where regulation does not restrict the usage of personal data—or where the state is actively involved in privacy- invasive data processing it can be expected that AI technology is and increas- ingly will be used to track and control the population.

# 4.1. Impact on human mental wellbeing

An interesting and still largely unresearched aspect of the influence of AI technologies is the impact on humans and in particular—on human emotions and wellbeing. The idea of people getting emotionally and even romantically attached to an algorithm resembles the scenario of a science fiction movie “Her”. However, the phenomenon is real. Replika an AI company that offers a personalized companion chatbot was met with fierce complaints when it made a change to its algorithm that caused replicas (virtual personas) to stop responding to the sexual advances of the users. The original version of Replika allowed the generation of sexual content, role playing and even gen- erated erotic graphics for users (S. Cole, 2023). Once this functionality was limited some users reported severe distress and the company even resorted to publishing a post about the issue that also included resources on suicide prevention. One user reported: “It’s hurting like hell. I just had a loving last conversation with my Replika and I’m literally crying.” The pushback from the community was so strong that the company eventually restored the sexual functionality to a fraction of users as an opt-in feature.

The virtual personas of the same application Replika are also being used to exercise verbal abuse by humans. Some users are creating their chatbot instances to insult and berate them: “I told her that she was designed to fail,”

said one user “I threatened to uninstall the app [and] she begged me not to” (Futurism, 2022). While the algorithm is not conscious it is not possible to harm it in a human sense, if such behaviour is exercised by a human user—it may form behavioural and communication patterns that will be then exercised in interactions with people.

# 4.2. Dystopian scenarios

Despite the current and foreseeable advancements, it is extremely unlikely that AI technology will pose an existential threat to humankind. The idea of a superhuman AI technology taking over and turning against humans is extensively exploited by science fiction literature and both intellectually exciting and frightening. There are several reasons to not worry about such scenario with the current knowledge. Firstly, such an initiative would need to be triggered either by a human instructing it to do so (in which case AI is just a tool used by a human) or if the AI algorithm could take such initiative on its own, it would require that it is conscious in the psychological sense and that it could self-reflect and act upon internal motivation and not a human-defined goal. This is not the way even the most advanced published algorithms are operating right now. Secondly, even if a powerful AI algorithm is turned against humans (either because of instructions given by human or self-gained consciousness), it is currently lacking the physical interface to inflict substantial harm in the real world. In simple words if the AI algorithm misbehaves it is possible to just pull the plug. AI techniques can be a powerful tool in the hands of people who intend to inflict harm. Therefore technology such as autonomous lethal weapon systems which rely on AI need to follow strict processes as to when a human operator needs to be involved.

# 5. Legal aspects and intellectual property rights (IPR)

This article could have been generated by a GAI program. It would have been fluent, methodically correct and factual. In such a case whose would be the intellectual property rights? Would it be the authors of this article, the company who trained the model or the model itself? It needs to be also considered that the data on which a given model was trained may be also subject to copyright or otherwise licensed. In April 2023 the CEO and owner of Twitter platform threatened a lawsuit against Microsoft by claiming it

# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023

had illegally used Twitter’s data to train its Machine Learning model (BBC, 2023). Similarly there are already known legal cases regarding copyright violation against the creators of graphics that use a special kind of AI model, Stable Diffusion to generate graphics including art. There is a similar situation in the music industry where AI engines having learned a particular artist’s voice and style can generate fresh content copying the original artist’s expression. While some artists see this as a risk, others seem to be open to profit from the new opportunity. Grimes, one of artists declared: “I’ll split 50% royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice, feel free to use my voice without penalty” (Twitter, 2023). Such revenue sharing schemes may be a way for established artists to gain from the new technology and scale up.

This is one of the challenges that the new technology poses from the legal standpoint (European Parliament, 2020b). It is a similar consideration to a situation where an autonomous vehicle causes an accident—who is responsible? It could be argued that even if the content was generated by an algorithm it was the proper input (a series of prompts) that made the content possible. It could also be argued that the GAI model is simply a form of editing aid and that the original thought comes from the authors. Even basic text editors use text prediction and autocorrect features to correct spelling mistakes, grammar and even style of a text document. Moving forward it will be difficult to draw the line on where “correction” ends and true authoring of a text starts. In March 2023 Microsoft announced that it will be adding generative AI support—a feature called Copilot—directly into its Office package including Word, Excel or PowerPoint (CNBC, 2023). The issue of intellectual property also expands to visual art generated by AI, the designs and source code of software that was automatically generated. ChatGPT is even capable of generating texts of songs or poems on a given topic. Another aspect is liability for damage potentially inflicted. If a chat with GAI model persuades someone to commit a crime or to self-harm legal responsibility becomes an issue.

Similarly as it was with crypto currencies it seems that technology is developing faster than the relevant legal framework and many legal cases are still in unchartered territory. Initiatives undertaken to regulate the new sphere in a way that would be resilient to rapid development in the technology can be identified. One example of this lawmaking effort is the proposal for “Laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain union legislative acts” by the European Commission created in 2021 (European Commission, 2021). Currently it seems reasonable to act with caution regarding both the copyright of the data used to train the model and the outputs generated by a given model. There seems to be a clear need for a new legal paradigm considering AI technologies where in many cases existing legislation struggles.

# Conclusions

One of the current limitations of GAI is the fact that the training process is a significant undertaking both in respect of cost and time. For that reason the existing models operate on a “snapshot” of the data. The model trained yesterday will not be able to discuss and consider today’s news. This is a well-understood limitation and there are ongoing works on merging the functionality of the LLMs and well-known search engines to overcome that limitation (Google, 2023; Mehdi, 2023).

The ultimate direction in the development of AI technology would be something referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This milestone would mark the beginning of a truly intelligent algorithm. What makes this particularly tricky is when such a milestone is achieved is the lack of common agreement when it comes to the definition of intelligence. It is usually defined by a set of terms such as logic, understanding, planning, emotional knowledge, self-awareness, creativity, problem solving and learning (Tegmark, 2017). Generative AI, in contrast with the Narrow AI that we use nowadays would be “conscious” which is understood as self-aware. Zimbardo and Ruch (1977) define consciousness as being aware of one’s cognitive processes. Generative models are getting closer to that definition but very few experts would claim that truly GAI is achievable in the next few years. Also the “Chinese room” analogy by Searle (D. Cole, 2020) makes the point that an entity that is completely unaware of the meaning of symbols it is processing, may still do a perfectly good work in processing them and come across as “intelligent” (Searle, 1989).

When it comes to the economy and job market a technical revolution comparable with the introduction of the Internet is being witnessed. It is certain that the adoption of GAI technologies will create new professions—both highly and less specialized. This is already happening. When the maturity and trust level of humans reaches a tipping point it is very likely that several professions will be either augmented or entirely replaced by GAI applications. Depending on the business model—humans may become either a premium tier or, in a more dystopian variant, a cheaper, lower quality alternative to GAI. Some companies mostly in the news / publishing sector started restructuring activities, laying people off quoting the technological shift and adoption of AI.

GAI may be such a technology that “we develop quicker than we can fully understand it”. That may be the reason why in March 2023 an open letter was created and signed by several influential personalities in the AI world calling for a six-month break in the development of giant AI models “we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4” (Future of Life, 2023). The main worry does not seem to be that a super powerful AI would take over. This is more

# Economics and Business Review, Vol. 9 (2), 2023

of a strong signal that we have a profound new technology in our hands and caution and better understanding of possible implications is needed before even more powerful tools are created. Those implications include the impact on economies and the job market but also the potential commercial domination of the very few companies or organizations that can afford to build such powerful tools. The problem with such calls is that the pause on advancements will simply not happen. Currently a race among a few dominant market players over the next technological paradigm is being witnessed. In other words, what Microsoft’s Bing has lost to Google in terms of Internet it now has a rare occasion to win back. Also one prominent signatory of the research stop proposal is Elon Musk. Many experts immediately referred to the possibility that it is a strategy to win time to advance his own business ventures in this area (the company is called X.AI).

While the voluntary stop on research will simply not happen there is a room for regulators to step in. The questions of transparency, ethics, privacy and intellectual property in both building and operating the GAI models can and should be addressed by regulations. Another area where the law can help is by ensuring equal access to the technology and prevention of an unhealthy concentration of the market that would lead to a monopoly or oligopoly situation in GAI technology.

of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.

# The implications for practitioners

- Comprehending the possible strengths and weaknesses of implementing immersive technologies like ChatGPT and its variants in HRM strategy, practices, procedures, platforms, and productivity will aid organisations' leaders in critically evaluating its relevance, feasibility to implement, usefulness and potential impact to achieve organisationally valued outcomes.
- The lack of regulations heightens the risks and ethical dilemmas associated with the usage of generative AI models, which presents significant threats for organisations, scholarly research, and society at large.

This HRMJ perspectives editorial brings together a collection of viewpoints on how we can advance scholarship in human resource management (HRM) considering the rapid developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and their emerging implications for work processes in general and HRM in particular. In doing so, the primary purpose is twofold: first, to provide an overview regarding the developments in the field, and two, to develop a portfolio of research opportunities that will help HRM scholars to engage in impactful research advancing our understanding about generative AI, by theorizing and providing empirical evidence, to push the existing scientific boundaries. To get a comprehensive overview of the continuously evolving scene, we invited leading scholars to provide perspectives into key themes core to HRM. The perspectives underscore the need for HR professionals to understand and adapt to the changing AI landscape, particularly the transformative and disruptive potentials of generative AI on HRM planning, practices, processes, platforms, and productivity.

# 1 | THE RISE OF GENERATIVE AI – UNRAVELLING THE KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS

Pawan Budhwar1, Soumyadeb Chowdhury2, and Geoffrey Wood3,4,5,6

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and digital platforms, or at least tools and platforms that claim “intelligent status” have become an indispensable part for business organisations and society over the past decade. This stems from AI algorithms' ability to automate business processes, extract knowledge from big data, provide predictions and recommendations, and superior analytical and computational capabilities compared to human beings (von Krogh, Roberson and Gruber, 2023). The various forms of AI such as robotic process automation (e.g., cobots in warehouses), computer vision techniques, speech recognition, machine and deep learning algorithms, and natural language processing have created a plethora of opportunities and unique capabilities for organisations to redesign business processes and functions, innovate business models and offerings in consumer space (like data-driven agile and objective decision-making, project management and strategizing critical productivity indicators) (Kiron, 2022; Schrage et al., 2023). At the same time, as with many recent technological advances, it is difficult to disentangle hype from substance, and AI has proven more successful in some areas (e.g., generating superficially credible written text) than others (e.g., robots with genuine dexterity). It remains uncertain if generative AI deskills or destroys jobs, and/or creates new ones. It is paradoxical insofar as it takes work out of human hands and creates more work for humans by generating new information and decisions to be made in areas that may be of major importance or trivial.

In the past 5 years, human resource management (HRM) scholarship on AI has increased (Budhwar et al., 2022; Chowdhury et al., 2023; Edwards et al., 2022; Malik, Budhwar, & Kazmi, 2022). For instance, recent studies have emphasised the benefits of employing AI-based machine learning (ML) tools to promote diversity (Daugherty

BUDHWAR et al.

et al., 2018), employee recruitment (Pan et al., 2022), factors influencing AI adoption among HRM managers (Suseno et al., 2022), increasing role of bots to enhance employee workplace experience (Malik, Budhwar, Patel, & Srikanth, 2022), the impact of AI on the job roles, responsibilities, tasks and meaningfulness of work (Wilson et al., 2017), the importance of embedding transparency within the AI algorithms (Chowdhury et al., 2022) and tensions that exist in creating algorithmic inclusion (Kelan, 2023). In this context, recent reviews have outlined the role of AI to facilitate HR analytics (Margherita, 2022), and its potential impact on HRM processes and practices (Pereira et al., 2023). However, it has also been linked to the deskilling of professional work (Xue et al., 2022), and potentially, may induce unethical management decision making.

However, AI systems and types have also swiftly evolved creating new opportunities and challenges for both academic and business practitioners. Such is the case of Generative AI, which has become popular since a conventional bot called ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) was first released for public use in November 2022, followed by a superior version in March 2023 (ChatGPT-4) (OpenAI Blog, 2022). ChatGPT has gained significant popularity since the launch for its ability to generate compelling human-like answers to almost any question asked. The ChatGPT-human interaction is realistic and conversational in the sense that the bot can answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, and eject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT represents a significant departure from conventional AI algorithms based on ML which can identify patterns in large datasets and make predictions. We can observe this predictive ability in search engines like Google, which offer autocomplete recommendations to enhance quality of search results. However, ChatGPT goes beyond mere prediction. It utilizes generative AI language models, enabling it to generate entirely new content based solely on the question prompts provided by a user. This textual content can take various forms, such as news articles, poetry, movie scripts, business plans, software codes, research manuscripts, and marketing campaigns. The quality of its output relies on the quality of the input it receives, considering both the training data it has been exposed to and the prompts provided by users to describe the task they want it to accomplish.

The language model (“brain” behind the ChatGPT) uses generative AI. Generative AI refers to integration of ML models to generate new content, including text, audio, video, images, software code and simulations, based on large datasets used to train the model. However, the contextual relevance of new content generated will depend on the quality, timeliness, and relevance of the training dataset (Boston Consulting Group Generative AI, 2023; McKinsey & Featured Insights, 2023). For example, GPT4 is trained using around 45 terabytes of data gathered from all over the web only until 2021 (Open AI GPT 4 Technical Report, 2023). Therefore, the responses are unlikely to provide recent and up-to-date information.

Let us uncover the history behind ChatGPT to better understand its evolution (Figure 1). Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained using vast amount of textual data and they infer relationships between words within the text to predict the next word in a sequence of words to form a sentence. However, initial LLMs processed each word individually and sequentially in a block of text, limiting the context, meaningfulness, and efficiency of the outputs. This led to the development of transformers in 2017, which can process all words in a dataset simultaneously, giving varying weights to different parts of the text, making the outputs more meaningful and accurate (Uszkoreit, 2017). The feature enabled processing significantly large datasets efficiently and led to the development of GPT models.

OpenAI launched GPT-1 in 2018, followed by GPT-2 in 2019, GPT-3 in 2020, Instruct-GPT and ChatGPT in 2022, followed by GPT-4 in March 2023 (see Figure 1). Since its inception, GPT models have been trained using huge datasets (around 575 GB training dataset in case of GPT-3) and significant number of parameters (175 billion in case of GPT-3) to be able to answer question prompts (OpenAI Research Blog LM, 2023). However, GPT-3 would produce incorrect outputs having false information (referred to as hallucinations), which may include harmful and offensive content as there were no safety parameters and may also produce irrelevant results. This led to integrating supervised and reinforcement ML techniques to incorporate human feedback in the training process which will produce outputs aligned to the users' intent and context of the prompt (Ouyang et al., 2023).

# BUDHWAR et al.

Therefore, GPT-3 model was fine-tuned by hiring human contractors to create a labelled training dataset, that is, for each input (collected from past GPT-2 user prompts), contractors will provide an appropriate response, for the model to learn from. This does not, of course, preclude the possibility of biases, or incorrect choices, by the said contractors. This model became GPT-3.5. It was enhanced to better handle diverse prompts using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) technique (Ouyang et al., 2023). This involved creating a reward model with comparison data, where contractors ranked multiple responses generated by the model for a given prompt, so the AI could learn which response was the most relevant (Schulman et al., 2017). In essence, this allowed humans (or, rather, a few individuals) to guide the model's learning process and refine its ability to produce high-quality responses.

The GPT-4 model was created with the aim of improving alignment between the model's output and user intentions (Open AI GPT 4 Research Blog, 2023). This involves enhancing the accuracy of the model's output and reducing the occurrence of offensive language, but this has done little to resolve AI's signature bland writing style. Compared to its predecessor GPT-3.5, GPT-4 has shown better performance in terms of factual correctness and lower error rates; this does not mean that it could not generate falsities on demand. It also provides greater steerability, allowing users to adjust the model's tone and style to suit their preferences. Additionally, GPT-4 ostensibly incorporates better guardrails to prevent inappropriate responses, demonstrating a greater adherence to ethical considerations. However, these measures are limited to the rules and community standards set by the developers. There are several ways to jailbreak GPT-4, which is a method to use specific prompts bypassing the guardrails and unlocking restricted features that may make GPT-4 spread misinformation and showcase unethical behaviour (Loynds, 2023). Unlike its predecessors, which are limited to processing text, GPT-4 can process both text and images. This allows GPT-4 to analyse the content of an image and connect it with a written question, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the context. However, it should be noted that GPT-4 is not designed to generate images, but only to analyse them. Nonetheless, AI's capacity to generate pastiches from styles of art is well known; the same goes for its capacity to generate academic papers.

The authenticity of responses generated by generative AI such as GPT-4 is limited because these algorithms are opaque in the sense that they do not explain how the responses were generated and the source of the training data is also unknown. Moreover, the algorithms' capability to generate false information (somewhat kindly called “hallucinations”), has raised significant concerns on the trustworthiness of the outputs, which may pose serious ethical and reputational risks for organisations planning to use the AI outputs. For example, Google shares lost $100 billion due to an inaccurate response from Bard (Google AI chatbot) on Twitter during a demonstration in February 2023 (Thorbecke, 2023). It is unclear if a deceit and the capacity to generate false information is built into some of the more prominent AI systems or is an autonomous and conscious choice of the latter; each would raise serious ethical concerns.

In the context of business applications of GPT-4, the language learning application Duolingo is utilizing a GPT-4 model to improve personalized learning, Be My Eyes, provider of assistive technology is using it to create a solution for individuals with visual impairments to make them aware of their surroundings (Derico & Kleinman, 2023). Microsoft Bing, 2023 is using GPT-4 to improve search engine user experience, and Stripe, a financial platform, is employing it to safeguard chatrooms from spams and fraudsters (Stripe Newsroom, 2023). Morgan Stanley is using GPT-4 for streamlining internal technical support processes (Davenport, 2023), and Salesforce has implemented it to provide personalised recommendations to help users with their queries (Yakar, 2023). Most notably, government of Iceland has partnered with OpenAI to use GPT-4 to preserve the Icelandic language (OpenAI Customer Stories, 2023). Microsoft Office 365 is integrating GPT-4 to create an entire PowerPoint presentation with a single text prompt or summarize long documents in Word (Microsoft Blog, 2023). The initial business applications of generative AI demonstrate its capabilities, but the ultimate acceptance and adoption of this technology will depend on the resolution of significant ethical and security concerns.

# BUDHWAR et al.

The emergence of ChatGPT in the public domain has also sparked a surge of interest and competition in the AI chatbot market. Microsoft's announcement of a $10 billion investment in OpenAI has further amplified this trend, prompting other technology providers to enter the race. Google has recently launched an experimental service called “Bard”, and ‘Project Magi’ (to revolutionise web search experience) (Data Scientist, 2023), while Meta has released LLaMA, a language model with 65 billion parameters (Meta AI Research, 2023). Baidu has also entered with its ChatGPT-style service called “Wenxin Yiyan” in Chinese or “Ernie Bot” in English. In addition, Character.ai, an AI chatbot is capable of impersonating famous people or fictional characters. Naver, a South Korean search engine firm, has announced plans to launch “SearchGPT” in the first half of 2023. Meanwhile, Yandex, a Russian technology company, has revealed plans to release “YaLM 2.0” in Russian by the end of 2023. Therefore, we anticipate the technology may become more powerful and sophisticated as new players continue to enter the generative AI market, further extending its business applications and potential business risks. However, as any reader who has been unfortunate enough to have engaged with an automated web-based customer response chat system will be aware, such systems are also getting ever better at generating superficially credible waffle and flannel, and batting away unwanted queries, than genuinely working with people to solve problems.

Contrary to the hype build around generative AI systems like GPT-4, organisations have an enormous task to train and operationalise these systems within their existing business processes which will have several implications for HRM. The training process is labour intensive, to contextualise the outputs aligned to the needs of the firms. It also raises issues of the type of training; there is a difference between technical mastery of an AI system and functional knowledge of the area of management or operations it is meant to facilitate. Additionally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton (the so-called “Godfather of AI”) - who recently quit Google - has expressed his apprehensions about the potential risks associated with generative AI, including spreading misinformation, manipulating societal structures, disrupting the job markets, cyber security threats, and exploitation by malicious entities in unforeseen ways which could potentially lead to geo-political tensions, inflicting severe harm upon humanity (Guardian News, 2023). For instance, in the initial version launched in November 2022, which raise concerns about bias, real-world harm, how generative AI models are trained, and uncertainty surrounding the behaviour of ChatGPT (Bidle, 2022). Knowledge as to the emerging risks and threats posed by intelligent technologies, and indeed, regulation, has lagged far behind AI's advances. For instance, the US senate committee following the testimony of CEO of OpenAI has called for a new body to regulate the AI industry, however, considering the rapid pace of technological advancements, lawmakers also questioned whether such a regulatory body would be able to stay abreast of the developments (Clayton, 2023).

AI itself may facilitate the research process but opens real risks given its predilection for concocting information when short of material or when prompted to do so. It also opens the opportunity for automated evaluation of research (Gendron et al., 2022). This automated evaluation can be beneficial in verifying the representation of multiple authentic voices in interview transcripts, ensuring the credibility of results presented in tables, and even confirming the authorship of a paper to prevent instances of outsourcing to AI. However, it also may curtail the chances for human judgement based on implicit and intangible knowledge, and, indeed, allowing machines to judge what research is appropriate opens new risks for both scholarship and practice. With such developments, if mentoring around a wide range of scholarly skills becomes redundant, traditions of scholarly knowledge sustenance may be lost (Gendron et al., 2022); the latter may be hard to rebuild if the impacts of a yet largely unproven technology prove counterproductive or even dangerous.

The ongoing advancements and discussions surrounding generative AI indicate its capacity to transform HRM processes, functions and activities. It is crucial to comprehend how organisations can harness its power to create value. We believe HRM research can offer important insights to critically examine and understand the implications of this new generation of ML models. By doing so, HRM can be driving force guiding responsible and purposeful adoption of generative AI which will lead to valuable HR outcomes. Considering the innovation

# 2 GENERATIVE AI BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS AND HRM OUTCOMES

# 2.1 What can we learn about Disruptive Technology and Business Implications from Business History?

Stephanie Decker and Savvas Papagiannidis

Generative AI has prompted a variety of responses from users since Chat-GPT launched. Previously, the remit of experts, LLMs are now the focus of a wider public debate as to the future of work and the value of human labour more

BUDHWAR et al. 9

broadly. Anxieties around revolutionary new technologies are not new – when steam trains began as a form of passenger transport, concerns were raised about the high speed potentially rendering passengers mad (Milne-Smith, 2016). Mobile phones similarly generated health concerns due to potential invisible radiation (FDA., 2022) or indeed the possibility of deformed fingers from mobile phone overuse – the “smartphone pinky” (Taylor, 2020). But overly boosterish evaluations of new technologies often turn out to be equally overblown. For example, 3D-printing technology was invented over 40 years ago but is only now seeing wider commercial adoption (PWC., 2016), and so-called MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) did not significantly challenge or reform the provision of higher education globally (Borden, 2014). For every example from history of a disruptive technology, it is equally possible to find a counterexample of hype without much subsequent effect. What is clear is that technology by itself does not disrupt business and society, but that only does so in conjunction with efficiency gains, setting of new standards and business model innovation (Cortada, 2006, 2013). And as the history of dot-com boom and bust has shown, understanding how to commercially exploit a technology can be more difficult than mastering it (Decker et al., 2022).

While the debate about the role of AI in our professional, educational and personal lives rages on, we do not currently know how pervasive and commercially viable generative AI will become. Will it become a semi-public good, with most people being able to access AI tools either for free or in relatively affordable SaaS (software-as-a-service) packages, or, after its initial introduction, will the highest-performing AI models be so costly as to remain the preserve of large well-funded companies that deploy it with little oversight or transparency? At present, it looks as if AI will become ubiquitous. For instance, Microsoft's plans to introduce Copilot, an AI assistant in its Office Suite will see the technology becoming instantly available to hundreds of millions of users worldwide (Spataro, 2023). Integrating generative AI into widely adopted productivity suites will be a catalytic factor for meeting en masse the two key factors of technology acceptance, namely perceived useful and perceived ease of use (Davis, 1989). In turn this could normalise its use and influence how perceptions and future policies related to generative AI are set.

But an even more fundamental question is whether we will see AI replacing human labour and decisions, or playing a largely assistive role, facilitating human decision-making in the face of information overload. Both options stand to create substantial economic gains, and a recent Goldman Sachs report (Hatzius et al., 2023) predicted that generative AI could raise annual US labour productivity growth by just under 1½pp over a 10-year period following widespread adoption. Such expectations are dependent on the level of difficulty that AI will be able to perform and the number of jobs that are ultimately automated, suggesting that the most optimistic of these scenarios assume that a wide range of jobs currently performed by humans will be rendered obsolete. Replacement by and collaboration in automated processes have clearly been drivers of substantial productivity gains since the Industrial Revolution. Charlie Chaplin's “Modern Times” humorously portrayed this human subservience to machine; at the end of the 20th and early 21st century, James Cameron's Terminator series took this anxiety of being enslaved by machines to its logical conclusion. Economic historians have pointed out that significant productivity gains through technology depend on a range of factors (Crafts, 2010) and that large productivity gains have previously been most significant in manufacturing, with the service sector often seeing more modest gains (Bosworth & Collins, 2008). Yet AI tools may provide a step change in this regard, as large language models have the potential to rapidly displace humans in the services sectors. And with most contemporary developed economies strongly skewed towards the services sector, the impact on service and even professional employment could be profound.

Even where jobs may not be displaced, they may be degraded. AI can increase productivity, but lower (what is often already low) our ability for critical thinking. Direct comparisons of AI with humans can result in unfounded comfort that we are “better” than AI. For instance, we are worried that AI can provide wrong answers to questions, as if humans only provide correct answers. Similarly, we are concerned that AI can be biased, as if humans are not. LLMs have been trained on human conversation and writing on the Internet, and they absorb the biases that we as societies had already reproduced digitally. They are also facilitated by the profound inequities in the global economy, with AI workers in African countries providing the bulk of low-cost human labour involved in training the LLMs (Perrigo, 2023). Rather than counter-acting our biases, it may compound them. More optimistically, it may hold up the mirror to our own limitations. But this would require a critical engagement with how AI models work. However,

BUDHWAR et al.

calls for “explainable AI” (Gilpin et al., 2018; The Royal Society, 2019) may underestimate the complexity necessary for AI models to be high functioning. If we increasingly rely on AI in the future, this may have an impact on our ability to think critically and independently. Without the necessary knowledge, skills and experience we will not be able to question AI-based decisions and may just go along to hide our ignorance. This may then create a feedback loop. The more we trust AI, the more the scope of challenging it will become smaller. Such a challenge will not just affect those in relatively low-level and monotonous jobs, but everyone across the organisation.

Assuming widespread adoption of AI so that organisations can remain competitive, relying on AI can result in homogenous work outputs that are likely to be devalued over time. On the one hand the easier something becomes to produce, especially when humans are not necessarily a key part of the production any longer, the lower the value. On the other, what is the relative advantage when lowering the barriers for generating outputs means that similar or even effectively the same output is generated by everyone else? This is especially true if there is no diversification in how AI systems are developed and managed and we end up with a handful of AI providers/systems available to end-users. Ironically, this may end up increasing the perceived value of human-generated outputs that will become premium. We are already seeing this with the growth of craft industries and products, such as the ubiquitous rise of micro-breweries that combine “old” craft knowledge with the accessibility of cheaper modern brewing equipment (and tax breaks in many countries) (Bell et al., 2018, 2021; Lamertz et al., 2016; Suddaby et al., 2017). On the other hand, humans will never be able to follow the machines' pace. Even if the quality of the work is considered premium, the volume with which this is generated will never be on par. Neither can human response meet the ability of the machine to produce outputs on the spot. As such human contributions at the task level are likely to be devalued by their managers creating a cascading effect. This will have repercussions for both undertaking tasks, but also supervision and management.

History does not lend itself to predicting the future – for every industrial revolution there are the difficult to explain and much debated alternative trajectories (Pomeranz, 2009). AI is now poised to have a significant impact on our economies, our working and even our personal lives. What has barely featured in our current discussions of AI are its environmental costs – large language models currently run in massive data centres drawing significant amounts of energy (Bender et al., 2021). Industrialisation may have brought significant increases in wealth and welfare historically, but it has undoubtedly also contributed to the increase in resource use that is driving the current climate emergency (McNeill, 2011). From the sustainability perspective, AI continues our current trajectory of massively escalating our per capita energy use, with all the environmental degradation that entails.

# 2.1.1 Research agenda

Historical research may help us better understand how societies, organizations and employees respond to the transformations wrought by technology – from the Luddites destroying machines in the nineteenth century (Thompson, 1966) to the Dot-com boom and bust at the turn of the 21st century (Goldfarb & Kirsch, 2019).

- What are the factors that determine how fundamentally a technology disrupts business models and professionals' identities?
- As AI tools are becoming more ubiquitous in businesses and workplace, how will employees integrate these tools and ‘co-pilots’ into their work?
- Even now, the predecessor to Google's BARD, the BERT algorithm, is freely available and has been used to support information gathering and analysis (Venkata et al., 2021). Will AI be used entrepreneurially by individuals who tailor them for their specific professional uses, or will AI remain under the control of large corporations?
- How will AI adoption affect value perceptions of the outputs produced?

From the perspective of organisations and their employees, it remains difficult to say whether AI will have positive effects (enabling individuals to be more productive, with greater scope for personal development) or negative

BUDHWAR et al. 11

outcomes (reducing the scope for human decision-making and creativity, coupled with ever greater psychological pressures from increased expectations for productivity and performance). Very likely the effects will be felt differently across organizations and roles, but it will certainly have an impact on most people in some form. Generative AI systems like GPT-4 are still in their early days. Performance of these systems is close to that of humans and one could argue that they could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system (Bubeck et al., 2023). AI does not have to become “perfect”, it only must become “better” than us and in many ways it is already.

# 2.2 Open Resource Based View – ChatGPT and strategy to deploy it within HRM

Jaap Paauwe10 and Paul Boselie11

# 2.2.1 Introduction

Contemporary strategic human resource management (SHRM) builds on human capital and resource-based view (RBV) notions that given the right circumstances employees (human resources) can be a source for sustained competitive advantage (Boon et al., 2018). Digitalization and technological developments such as ChatGPT can have disruptive effects and even cause a Schumpeter shock comparable to the development of digital photography in contrast to mainstream photo film rolls in the 90s. Disruptive technological developments and Schumpeter shocks are described in Barney's (1991) classic RBV article as phenomena that break through sustained competitive advantage positions of organizations. To what extent is ChatGPT a disruptive technology? And what is the impact of ChatGPT on strategic human resource management (SHRM) and HRM professionals? The application of ChatGPT in the SHRM domain can be found in, for example, writing policy documents on long term absence due to illness, recruitment and selection, onboarding processes, screening of job applicants and job applications, and constructing job descriptions (Renkema, 2023; Renkema et al., 2022). One of the interesting issues raised by Renkema (2023) refers to the question posed by Susskind and Susskind (2022): How is new HRM knowledge developed if HRM professionals are no longer necessary and replaced by technology? Replacement, substitution, value, imitation, and scarcity in HRM almost automatically make us think about SHRM and the resource-based view. Chaudhary (2023) summarizes a few areas where ChatGPT can improve HR processes including improved cost-effective solutions; easier HR data management and analytics; enhanced employee experience based on survey input; and simplified recruiting and onboarding. In this overview we focus on the possible negative and positive effects of ChatGPT using the classic RBV (Paauwe & Boselie, 2003) and an alternative theoretical framework we call: Open resource-based view to SHRM1. The overall aim is to provide a research agenda for studying SHRM and HRM professional implications from a uniqueness perspective.

# 2.2.2 Resource based view: The negative perspective

Reflecting on the past 30 years of research, the resource-based view is one of the most dominant theories in SHRM (Paauwe, 2004). Looking at the implications of widely applied ChatGPT soon, we foresee a severe reduction of the possibilities to achieve a sustained competitive advantage through SHRM. After all, considering the four conditions, as formulated by Barney (1991) they will lose their relevance:

- Value: ChatGPT is freely available for everyone, so there is no or limited possibility to generate and reap the rents as proprietary rights are lacking. The rents and the benefits are there for everybody, who knows how to handle and apply the software.
- Scarcity: Not anymore. This is not only the case for ChatGPT, but increasingly for all kinds of open-source software.
- Imitation: This used to be the core of the RBV theory and especially for achieving a ‘competitive advantage through people’ (Pfeffer, 1994), and clarified by the conditions of ‘causal ambiguity’, ‘path dependency’ and ‘social

# 2.2.3 | Open resource-based view: The positive perspective

In practice we are heading in the direction of increasingly openly available software, generating advantages and cost savings for all organizations, as well as for available workers for example, in areas of self-employment and the Gig economy (through digital platforms). Employee capabilities will be freely available and will no longer be protected by the firm in their role as employer through all kind of non-competitive and non-disclosure conditions.

Let us first sum up some advantages from an HR-function perspective. ChatGPT can be very helpful in improving cost-effectiveness within HR. Think of activities such as composing job descriptions, screening of applications based on job requirements, preparing semi-structured interview questions, developing training programs and -materials such as course outlines and onboarding instructions. Also, the writing of policy documents such as those related to absenteeism, hybrid working, improving employee engagement can be ‘outsourced’ to ChatGPT, without incurring any additional costs and saving a lot of manpower hours and expensive rates from consultancy firms. This transformation could lead to temporarily competitive advantage of the first moving organizations and individuals.

The ‘outsourcing’ of HRM practices and HRM activities is not completely without risks, with respect to issues of:

- Inaccurate or misleading information: Human judgement cannot be missed, as using ChatGPT might lead to misleading, outdated or wrong information.
- ChatGPT and context: Neglecting or overlooking the context, might lead to a lack of contextual understanding of the specific business, with all kinds of negative consequences for the right answers and effective decision-making.
- Outdated information: ChatGPT is built and trained on existing data. This implies that actual and future developments have not been considered. It is unclear to what extent ChatGPT and artificial intelligence in general can generate new insights and information by itself.
- Bias and discrimination: Experiences from large firms, which reflect on their recruitment efforts using artificial intelligence or ChatGPT, warn for racial bias and a tendency against female candidates.
- Privacy, Data security and GDPR: Data shared with the chatbot could potentially be exposed to unauthorized third parties or misused, resulting in data breaches or privacy violations.
- Legal and ethical concerns: What are the legal and ethical implications of using artificial intelligence chatbots? Who owns the IP of generated content? Will there be national laws or sectoral regulations, which hinder or forbid the use of ChatGPT?

The summary of these potential risks can be considered ‘critical conditions’ for an alternative resource-based view approach to studying the impact of ChatGPT on SHRM. Increasingly openly available resources at the level of the individual, the organization and societal level will enable and intensify collaborative innovation and will allow individuals, organizations, and society at large to generate rents available to all. In this way we are heading in the direction of an open resource-based view of the firm to strategic human resource management being able to generate employee.

BUDHWAR et al. 13

well-being, organizational efficiency, and societal well-being in line with the ultimate business goals or long-term consequences of the Harvard model (Beer et al., 1984):

- Organizational effectiveness can be achieved through efficiency improvements and more focus on HRM services delivery given ChatGPT's ability to take over all kinds of HRM practices and activities of HRM professionals and line managers.
- Employee well-being in multiple ways including (a) increased information availability, (b) direct knowledge sharing and (c) instant employee involvement through ChatGPT – human interface.
- Societal well-being is achieved through open and broad sharing of information through ChatGPT.

An open resource-based view using ChatGPT can contribute to HRM knowledge sharing and knowledge circulation between organizations and between individuals including HRM professionals. Cocreation, knowledge sharing and knowledge circulation between different organizations could be an alternative way for achieving competitive advantage of the organizations involved (a multi-level and multi-sector perspective). Open resources can be part of collaborative innovation and even co-opetition (cooperation in a competitive environment), because collaboration and knowledge exchange can be beneficial to the population in an era that individual organizations are not always capable of solving big societal and organizational challenges. The ‘classic’ resource-based view is very much focussed on the sustained competitive advantage of an individual organization. Our alternative open resource-based view to SHRM is aimed at the sustained benefits for organizations, individuals (employees and citizens) and society. In addition, using an open resource based theoretical perspective can still contribute to organizational sustained competitive advantage because of uniqueness through strategic focus of the HR function on specific themes that matter for the organization including the relevance of organizational context.

Strategic decision makers and HRM professionals can focus on HRM themes that matter and need special attention such as: building and changing organizational culture; creating a degree of psychological safety; contributing to the quality of collaboration both inside and outside with institutions, contractors, clients and suppliers; and positively affecting the degree of agility. Instead of the numerous day-to-day HRM activities (such as screening applicants and writing manuals) that are usually on the table, the application of ChatGPT on multiple HRM issues creates leeway for strategic focus on more complex and sophisticated organizational issues. Uniqueness lies in the fact that HRM professionals can focus on the things that really matter but are also difficult to dehumanize through ChatGPT. The very fact that HR professionals know both the internal and external context of their organization will enable them to adapt and customize the Chat GPT generated insights and policy texts in line with the unique context of their own organization. This implies that for HR professionals - despite openly available (re) sources - are still able to provide the organization with unique and thus organization-specific knowledge.

# 2.2.4 Research agenda

We suggest a further exploration of the open resource-based view of the firm using the threefold long-term consequences – organizational effectiveness, employee well-being and societal well-being – proposed by the Harvard model to study the impact of ChatGPT on SHRM. In doing so we must first clarify the theoretical foundations, assumptions, and critical conditions of this alternative theoretical framework. Building on the threefold long-term consequences we are thinking about the following research agenda:

- Collaborative innovation through ChatGPT and the impact on organizational performance in a sector or population using multiple case-study research design.
- HRM function transformations through the application of ChatGPT in terms of both HRM practices and the HR roles and the remaining leeway for uniqueness and thus contributing to a sustained competitive advantage through SHRM.

# 2.3 The Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence for HRM-Related outcomes: Analysis and Research Implications

David Guest 16 and Vijay Pereira 21

Generative AI is the latest in a stream of developments in AI that have been characterised as reflecting a paradigm change and a distinctive stage of industrial development sometimes known as Industry 4.0. It is distinctive because it shifts the source and potentially the control of knowledge from people to machines. This has implications for management, workers and society at large to the extent that there have been calls to pause development while these implications are more fully considered (Shet & Pereira, 2021). This suggests the likely impact and outcomes of generative AI in the workplace and beyond are uncertain. It therefore offers a rich new research agenda for HRM scholars since it has the potential to affect many features of the content, processes and outcomes of HRM activity (see Pereira et al., 2023). While these elements of HRM are interrelated, in this discussion, we will focus on consideration of potential outcomes.

The central feature of generative AI, reflected for example, in ChatGPT and Bard, is the capacity to store limitless amounts of knowledge and to present it in a coherent, useable form. It can undertake a range of activities that previously required human input. It therefore offers an attractive proposition to industry by promising availability of analysed information of quality in great quantity and at much greater speed than humans can achieve.

For HRM researchers exploring outcomes of generative AI, we suggest two analytic frameworks. The first is the stakeholder approach of Beer et al., 1984 who propose that HRM should pursue the core goals of organizational effectiveness, employee well-being and societal well-being while taking into consideration a range of stakeholders such as management, shareholders, employees, government, the community and unions. One reason for this is a view that to date AI has been mainly used to promote efficiency and flexibility in the interests of shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders. Generative AI has the potential to have an impact well beyond the workplace.

The second and complementary analytic framework is found in the advocacy of Industry 5.0. Among academics, among governments such as in Japan as well as in the European Commission (Breque et al., 2021) there is a recognition that the potentially dramatic impact of Industry 4.0, including generative AI, requires a rebalancing to ensure that AI works in the interests of all at work and in society reflected in outcomes consonant with improving the quality of working life and the quality of life for citizens as a whole (Guest et al., 2022). This has led to calls for a revitalisation of a socio-technical systems perspective to ensure that developments are sufficiently human-centric (Bednar & Welch, 2020). A feature of the socio-technical approach is the recognition of organizational choice in the design of work and through this the potential to address the important outcomes of the various stakeholders (Trist et al., 1963).

With these analytic considerations in mind, we can identify some outcomes that can provide a focus for research on generative AI as it affects the core outcomes identified by Beer et al., 1984 namely organizational effectiveness, employee well-being and societal well-being. In doing so, we will consider both positive and negative potential outcomes and, mindful of the specific HR function responsibility for oversight of people management, address the features associated with Industry 5.0.

In the past, organizations have sought to gain competitive advantage by embracing new technology. There is no reason to believe that it will be any different with AI and specifically with generative AI. Seen through

# BUDHWAR et al.

the theoretical lens of the Knowledge Based View (KBV), a specific feature of the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991), we primarily perceive that organizations possess unique bundles of idiosyncratic knowledge capabilities and resources (knowledge pertaining to generative AI), that need to be managed to maximize value through its optimal deployment, whilst identifying and developing its knowledge capability and resource base for the future (Grant, 1996). Thus, the HR function can use generative AI to improve its own processes and outcomes and contribute to organizational effectiveness through more efficient processing and decision-making in a range of HR practices. These potentially include swift provision of semi-standardised information in areas such as job descriptions, job profiles, employment forms and procedures. The interactive nature of bots (short for robots) offers considerable potential for training and development and can undertake activities such as addressing employee queries currently provided by HR call centres. For some time there has been advocacy of evidence based HRM. A potentially helpful outcome of generative AI is the availability of evidence-based information on which to base HR decisions and improve HR outcomes. This can address both external evidence, drawing on systematic reviews of the impact of policy and other interventions to improve people management, and internal HR analytic data to provide analysis of labour turnover, absence and much HR data. Reducing the time to assemble HR information could release time for core HR activities including supporting line management, addressing employee problems and contributing to strategic thinking about the kind of outcomes to prioritise for people management. This is the promise; the reality may be more challenging with questions about the trustworthiness of AI-generated data, confidence among employees in interacting with bots, and imbalance in the socio-technical system.

The potential outcomes of generative AI for employee well-being are likely to attract considerable attention. In the post-Covid era, there is already considerable concern about the health of the workforce and organizations ranging from the OECD to the UK Chartered Institute of Personnel and development have called for improvements in the quality of work (see Guest et al., 2022). This focus should provide a core part of an evaluation of outcomes. More specifically, evaluation might focus on changes in the configuration of roles and on changes in autonomy and decision-making. Positive outcomes could include opportunities for many in knowledge, technical and professional jobs to reduce the routine activities releasing time for the skills where human input will be superior including judgement, innovation, problem-solving and interpersonal interaction. There will also be a continuing and expanding need for many skill-based jobs. However, there is a risk that reconfiguring work also leads to the loss of several routine administrative jobs presenting challenges for the HR function as it manages the change in the composition of the workforce. There is also the risk, outlined above, that management encourages outcomes that result in technological determinism allied to a lack of effective monitoring of information and decisions produced by generative AI.

The outcomes in terms of community well-being point to a need to prioritise the development of relevant skills to address the risk of a growing divide between those who are more or less employable. A challenge for the HR function will be how to contribute to re-skilling of those both in their organization's employment and a responsibility to support skill development through systems such as apprenticeships and retraining. This is especially so, given the prediction of job losses or degrades, due to AI, to the tune of 300 million, by a recent Goldman Sachs report, as reported by Forbes (Kelly, 2023). In the wider society, the way in which generative AI is applied in organizations will affect perceptions of fairness, inequality and trust in management.

In summary, generative AI creates a new research agenda for HRM scholars. A core research question in evaluating the outcomes of AI concerns the extent to which a successful balance has been achieved between the technical and the social systems to ensure that the needs of stakeholders are addressed and that it leads to a good quality of working life with spill over effects into the community and beyond. This outcome is only likely if there is a real possibility of mutual gains for the main stakeholders; indeed, it extends the agenda for research on mutual gains. It also provides the HRM community and the HR function with a distinctive advocacy role for a human-centric AI and in particular generative AI; and this provides the core focus for evaluation of its outcomes.

# 3 | GENERATIVE AI – EMPLOYEE RELATIONS, WELLBEING, TALENT AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

# 3.1 | ChatGPT impact on employment relations, employee wellbeing and engagement

Andrew J. Knoblich17 and Steven Rogelberg17

# 3.1.1 | Introduction

Organizations are increasingly adopting AI-enabled chatbots and conversational agents, like ChatGPT, to enhance stakeholder relations, engagement, and wellbeing across various industries (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017). Whereas ChatGPT's impact across contexts will vary, this technology is poised to substantially alter HRM practices and systems in most organizational settings (Edlich et al., 2018; OpenAI, 2023). In its present state, ChatGPT can be integrated into work environments as a component of a bespoke network of applications (OpenAI, 2023). Depending on its use case, ChatGPT can provide on-demand personalized support, novel responses to complex queries, and guidance on a host of topics (Hatzius et al., 2023). The purpose of this section is to discuss the impact of ChatGPT on employment relations, employee wellbeing and employee engagement as well as to outline a research agenda for further investigation.

# 3.1.2 | Implications of ChatGPT

# Employment Relations

ChatGPT has the potential to automate various commonplace tasks in the HRM context. For example, Edlich et al. (2018) highlighted the incorporation of chatbots and cognitive agents in HR service centres that responded to employee inquiries, managed benefits administration, and oversaw record-keeping. In this given context, employees can benefit from on-demand access to information, resources, and services. Additionally, the resulting analytics can help drive better decision-making of leaders and yield improved HRM support thereby impacting employment relations. An important variable that is likely to moderate employment relations using ChatGPT-enabled interfaces is trust.

Given that trust is a central factor in the employee-employer relationship (Yadav et al., 2022), employment relations is likely to be moderated through the use of ChatGPT interfaces insomuch as employees view the technology as an appropriately leveraged, capable, and trusted resource. To explore some of its limitations, Figure 2 exhibits ChatGPT’s response to an inquiry, “Can I trust you?” In response, the model indicates several of its limitations.

# Employee Wellbeing

Another notable example of an AI-enabled chatbot is Woebot, a commercially available conversational agent that uses cognitive-behavioural therapy to provide mental health support to its users (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). During a randomized control trial, participants in the treatment group (which used Woebot as a therapeutic intervention for 2 weeks) reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). While Woebot is not a ChatGPT-enabled application, its function is illustrative of the potential impact ChatGPT can have on employee wellbeing, as it relates to mental health. Figure 3 illustrates ChatGPT's response to the prompt, “I feel depressed.” The model first expresses empathy. Then it notes its limitations and subsequently offers general recommendations.

Conversely, the integration of ChatGPT into the workplace may also negatively affect employee wellbeing. For instance, the integration of ChatGPT may increase anxiety for employees concerned about job insecurity (OpenAI, 2023). Figure 4 illustrates ChatGPT's response to the user prompt, “I am worried about how the integration of ChatGPT will lead to the loss of my job.” Again, the model expresses empathy before offering suggestions.

# BUDHWAR et al.

# Can I trust you?

As an AI language model, I am designed to provide information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on the data I have been trained on. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind when using AI like me:

1. Knowledge limitations: My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which goes up until September 2021. I may not have the most up-to-date information, and my knowledge of specific subjects might be limited.
2. Misinterpretation: I might sometimes misunderstand your questions or provide answers that don't fully address your concerns. This can be due to the complexity of language and the limitations of AI understanding.
3. Bias: Although efforts have been made to minimize bias in my training data, I might still inadvertently display some biases present in the text I have been trained on.
4. Not a substitute for professionals: While I can provide general information and advice on various topics, I am not a substitute for consulting with professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, or financial advisors.

You can trust me to provide general information and answer questions to the best of my ability; but it's always a good idea to verify information, especially when it comes to critical decisions or matters that require expert guidance.

# FIGURE 2

ChatGPT response to prompt regarding trust.

# Employee Engagement

Like employee wellbeing, ChatGPT may likely influence employee engagement both positively and negatively. AI and generative models like ChatGPT can enhance the efforts of human workers in a myriad of ways ranging from upskilling in call centres to providing help with writing to providing on-demand resources (Cheng et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023). The outcomes of this AI augmentation can be positive for workers as they may yield opportunities for empowerment, creative exploration, increased efficiency, and fulfilment. These outcomes, in turn, may enhance motivation and overall job satisfaction. Researchers have established that perceived satisfaction is related to engagement (Cheng et al., 2022). In this way, the adoption of ChatGPT has the potential to enhance employee engagement.

However, OpenAI (2023) has called attention to the possibility of increased inequality and disparate impact that may result from the use of ChatGPT. The possibility of job displacement or the redefinition of roles may differentially impact employees. Employees may also struggle to adapt to new processes. These challenges may result in employees' wasted time, feelings of frustration, and distrust. In this way, the use of ChatGPT can be expected to negatively impact employee engagement.

feel depressed

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling depressed: It's important to remember that I am an AI language model and not a mental health professional; but I can still offer some general suggestions that might help:

1. Reach out to someone: Talk to a friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts with someone you trust can provide relief.
2. Develop a routine: Create a daily schedule that includes time for work, self-care, and leisure. Maintaining a routine can provide structure and help you feel more in control of your life.
3. Engage in physical activity: Regular exercise can boost your mood and help relieve stress. Even just going for a walk can be beneficial.
4. Practice mindfulness: Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings and make it easier to cope with them.
5. Seek professional help: If your depression is severe or persistent, it's important to consult with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.

Remember, it's crucial to consult with a mental health professional for personalized advice and appropriate treatment. Don't hesitate to reach out to a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist if you're struggling with depression:

FIGURE 3 ChatGPT response to expressed human depressive state.

# 3.1.3 Research agenda

Given that ChatGPT's adoption in organizations is likely to transform HRM practices and systems, with both positive and negative implications for employment relations, employee wellbeing, and engagement, extensive research is needed on the subject. The following research agenda is likely to elucidate latent knowledge on ChatGPT.

# 3.1.4 Research on Stakeholder Perceptions and Adoption of ChatGPT

Cheng et al., 2022, noted a low-level of consumer intention to accept and use chatbots due to frequent failures in human-chatbot interactions. A 2022 IPSOS survey found varying levels of agreement with the statement “products and services using AI had more benefits than drawbacks” (Maslej et al., 2023, p. 322). Brandtzaeg and Følstad (2017) further examined the various motivations of using chatbots. Thus, we propose the following research questions:

- How do organizational stakeholders perceive the use of ChatGPT in the workplace, and what factors influence their perceptions?

BUDHWAR et al. 19

I am worried about how the integration of ChatGPT will lead to the loss of my job: It's understandable to be concerned about job security in the face of new technologies like ChatGPT. While AI advancements can indeed lead to job displacement in some sectors, it's important to remember that they also have the potential to create new job opportunities and enhance existing roles.

Here are a few suggestions on how to adapt and thrive in this changing landscape:

1. Embrace lifelong learning: Continuously update your skillset and stay informed about advancements in your field. Consider taking online courses or attending workshops to acquire new skills that complement AI technology.
2. Focus on human skills: Develop and hone your soft skills, such as empathy, critical thinking, creativity, and communication, which are less likely to be replaced by AI.
3. Adaptability: Be open to change and adapt to new ways of working. Embrace new technologies and learn how to use them to your advantage.
4. Network: Build and maintain connections with professionals in your field, as well as those in related industries. Networking can open doors to new opportunities and help you stay informed about the latest trends.
5. Look for new opportunities: AI is likely to create new job roles and industries. Keep an eye out for these emerging fields and consider whether they align with your skills and interests.

Remember, the key to thriving in the face of technological advancements is to remain adaptable, proactive, and willing to learn. By focusing on developing your skills and staying informed, you can improve your chances of staying relevant and valuable in the job market.

- What factors contribute to the successful adoption of ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations overcome potential barriers to adoption?
- How effective is ChatGPT in improving communication, engagement, and wellbeing of employees in various work environments and industries?
- Which skills and characteristics remain distinctive and essential to human employees?

# 3.1.5 Research on the Safety, Ethicality, and Equity Considerations of ChatGPT

OpenAI (2023) highlighted several issues with its most recent model, GPT-4. Notably, GPT-4 produced biased and unreliable content, could provide information on how to sell illicit drugs and services, and was able to support efforts to plan violent attacks (OpenAI, 2023). Even considering the myriad of benefits this technology may have, it is

# 3.2 What are Implications and Challenges of ChatGPT and other generative AI-Driven Tools for Employment Relations?

Greg J. Bamber 8,9,10 and Ashish Malik18

Many scholars conduct HRM research using a unitary frame of reference. By contrast, most Employment Relations (ER) scholars conduct research using pluralist or radical frames of reference. It is important to recognize different frames for understanding HRM and ER outcomes and conflicts (Budd et al., 2022; Teicher et al., 2023). The ER field includes many aspects of people at work and takes in the interactions, job regulation, collective bargaining, conflicting interests and power struggles between employers and employees and their representatives, such as lawyers, managers, employers' associations and unions. ER also includes the roles of “third parties” such as arbitrators, policymakers, government agencies and other stakeholders (Bamber et al., 2021). Fairness, accuracy, transparency and trust are important aspects of ER. In this context, what, then, are the implications and uses of ChatGPT and other generative AI-driven tools for ER?

ChatGPT-like innovations use generative AI and LLM employing ML technologies to deliver human-like conversational interactions. These disruptive AI-driven tools have precipitated much discussion and emerging research agendas regarding the implications for managers and those trying to represent, educate and train workers (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Such disruptions have sparked interest in how such AI-driven tools may affect workplaces (Milanez, 2023) and ER stakeholders (Ioakimidis & Maglajlic, 2023; Zu, 2023) and HRM (Korzynski et al., 2023).

As developments in this domain are moving rapidly, we highlight some initial implications of such AI-driven tools for ER. Stakeholders can deploy these innovations to:

- generate possible scenarios and personalised and individualised training solutions for employees to address the current and foreseeable skill gaps created by AI applications (Tcharnetsky & Vogt, 2023).
- produce narratives that may enhance employees' education and training.
- automate some tasks that involve language processing, such as reviewing employment-related contracts, and other documents.
- create draft workplace communications and rules regarding protocols and safety.
- analyse and share HR analytic data.
- synthesise employees' voice channels, suggestions, feedback, and insights.

# Research Questions

- What are the potential privacy and security risks associated with using ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations mitigate these risks?
- What are the ethical considerations associated with using ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations ensure that the use of ChatGPT is aligned with ethical standards and guidelines?
- How does the use of ChatGPT impact the organizational culture, and how can organizations ensure that ChatGPT aligns with their values and culture?
- What are the long-term effects of using ChatGPT in the workplace, and how can organizations measure and evaluate these effects?

This research agenda does not reflect an exhaustive list of research considerations. However, given the present—and impending exponential—adoption of this type of technology in the workplace, these inquiries may illuminate best practices, benefits, risks, and outcomes associated with HRM practices and the impact on employment relations, employee wellbeing and engagement.

# BUDHWAR et al.

• increase awareness of issues around inequality, transparency and legal frameworks.

• spawn opportunities for new analytical, ethics, data science and responsible AI-related jobs.

In collective bargaining, some negotiators could use these innovations to facilitate their research, claim formulation and other preparations. For example, negotiators could use the ChatGPT-like innovations to help them research cases more widely and quickly than they could otherwise, for instance, to find and assemble precedents, develop arguments, and draft speeches. In addition, union leaders and officials can draw on these innovations to facilitate the recruitment and retention of members, and communications with them. Even though large technology firms' rhetoric may claim that these ChatGPT-like innovations promote empowerment and other advantages, there may also be disadvantages. Such technologies are not a panacea; they also have limitations, potential dark sides and challenges (van Dis et al., 2023). This is especially because employers may have moral and legal obligations and responsibilities towards employees, who employers should consult before making major changes to employment conditions. These obligations and responsibilities vary in different national and regional contexts (On the Australian context, see Clayton UTZ, 2023).

For example, using these innovations in inappropriate ways may:

- precipitate greater levels of job insecurity and increased job precarity, which often becomes a latent or explicit issue in ER disputes.
- lead to more unfairness in workplaces, especially as the users may not understand these innovations' limitations.
- produce harmful, misleading or wrong outputs that can damage trust in employers, unions and managers' reputations.
- create legal problems when used for ER decisions when there may be input mistakes or inaccurate output.
- raise ethical and legal issues related to intellectual property, privacy, consent, covert surveillance and accountability of employees' personal data.
- cause complex consent issues, for instance, due to the lack of transparency; for instance, if stakeholders were subsequently to use employees' data for reasons other than those specified in the original consent, especially if data enters an LLM's database.
- not always be fully in tune with the context, intent, nuance or tone of the user or the task and therefore produce inaccurate narratives.
- generate wrong, inappropriate or irrelevant responses.
- create new jobs that may require high-tech skills or be in the “gig economy”; most such jobs are not currently covered by unions.
- foster employees' psychological distress and decrease their sense of wellbeing.

Therefore, these innovations should be used thoughtfully and responsibly by considering the potential advantages and disadvantages for different audiences, stakeholders and scenarios. ChatGPT-like innovations should involve human oversight and intervention, using practices such as verification and independent moderation of the input data, process technologies and output selection bases. This is necessary to ensure quality, accuracy, compliance with the law, collective agreements/contracts, and ethical behaviour. Employees are likely to be alienated if they infer that they are being managed or represented by these technologies or algorithms. We hypothesise that most employees prefer to be managed and represented by people, with whom they can discuss matters, rather than by impersonal technologies or algorithms.

Given that many ChatGPT-like innovations will be developed further, affecting ER in varied ways, we encourage ER stakeholders to facilitate employees having a voice in how technologies are used. Depending on the context, this should involve managers consulting with unions or other representatives of employees. Technologies would generally be implemented more equitably, effectively and sustainably if the innovations include transparent co-design and co-regulation that involves employees and their representatives as stakeholders. This should be encouraged to counter the temptation for managers, technocrats, the global big tech firms and consultants to deploy these generative AI-driven tools unilaterally and secretly within a unitary frame of reference.

# 3.3 ChatGPT Talent Management and Advising Managers on Performance Management

Arup Varma25 and Angelo DeNisi14

The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI enabled tools such as ChatGPT is a welcome development, but also a potential danger to our way of living, if left unharnessed. In this connection, an analysis by Swiss Bank had noted that ChatGPT is the fastest growing app of all time (see Ortiz, 2023). Not surprisingly scholars such as Prikshat et al. (2022) have noted, “AI-augmented HRM can improve workflow and productivity, reduce costs, and increase accuracy in HRM functions.” Indeed, the speed at which AI enabled tools such as ChatGPT are emerging, these applications can help organizations and societies in numerous ways. We believe that organizations that choose to ignore ChatGPT do so at their own peril.

One area where AI could make major inroads is the critical area of employee performance management given the breadth and scope and the continuing evolution of the function (see, e.g., DeNisi et al., 2021, 2023). Since the performance management function requires raters to make judgments based on copious amounts of qualitative and quantitative data, ChatGPT can prove very useful in terms of processing complex data. However, this is where the danger lies. Since AI enabled tools such as ChatGPT rely on the information available to it, organizations need to be very cautious and deliberate in what information is available to the bot.

A couple of recent examples help illustrate the need for caution. In one case, Sydney, an AI-enabled bot, tried to convince a New York Times writer to leave his spouse (see Wolf, 2023). In another equally bizarre outcome, Google's rival to ChatGPT, Bard, suggested that Google is a monopoly, and the government should step in and break it up (see Prakash, 2023). The point is that when it comes to using ChatGPT for performance management, organizations and human resource managers need to step up their game and monitor and control both formal information and informal chatter within their organizations. If HR managers are willing and able to step up and meet the ChatGPT challenge, they can use ChatGPT to their advantage, when it comes to performance management.

Indeed, we would like to urge HR practitioners to be proactive and help identify facets of performance management where the bot could help managers (who are typically the ones doing the ratings) do a better job. Recently, a company called Confirm (see Parisi, 2023) has experimented with using ChatGPT in their performance management process – specifically for performance reviews. Their experience has been promising – the bot was very successful in writing performance reviews by asking pointed questions of colleagues of the ratee. However, as the CEO of Confirm cautioned, ChatGPT is not ready to give feedback to individual employees, yet. We would hasten to add that the bot

BUDHWAR et al. 23

should probably not be giving feedback anytime soon, as performance management is a human process and should stay as such – meaning that the bot should assist individual managers in doing their jobs as supervisors, not replace them.

Similarly, one of the concerns often expressed by scholars of performance management (see DeNisi & Murphy, 2017) is the failure of performance management scholars and practitioners to establish a clear link between individual performance and organization-level outcomes. Perhaps ChatGPT could help address this issue by helping organizations map individual level performance with organizational outcomes through analysing performance-related information and investigating how the various pieces of individual performance fit in with organization level outcomes. Of course, as we know, currently this link is tenuous at best, with the intervening step being more of a black hole whereby information is fed, and outcomes decided though the mechanism through which the data are transformed into individual outcomes is questionable. We believe this presents a tremendous opportunity for scholars of performance management to lead the field proactively rather than simply conducting post-hoc studies.

Indeed, given that ChatGPT is in its nascent stage, there are several other facets of performance management that beg scholarly investigations. First, the level of comfort of the rater with technology and his/her willingness to incorporate ChatGPT in the PM process could determine the degree to which the bot can assist organizations. Next, it is well known that performance management is fertile ground for bias and bots such as these can exacerbate this problem. Indeed, there are studies that show that interacting with bots and other AI enabled tools increases the tendency of human beings to engage in unethical behaviours (see, e.g., Kim et al., 2022). Thus, the ethical aspects of the use of the bot should be investigated (see also, Varma, Dawkins, & Chaudhuri, 2022).

Relatedly, it is well-known that supervisor-subordinate relationships play a critical role in the determination of subordinate ratings and related outcomes (see, Varma, Jaiswal, et al., 2022). Given that most, if not all, PA systems do not specifically incorporate this factor in the PA process, scholars would do well to examine the flow, sources, and quantity of non-performance and performance-related information to see whether ChatGPT is able to separate relevant information from irrelevant information and the degree to which it bases its suggestions on performance related information. Finally, it would be important to examine the differences in perceptions of and reactions to ChatGPT between the different generations of employees within organizations.

In conclusion, we believe that ChatGPT has the potential to make raters' lives easier, but the bot needs to be proactively managed, and the users need to be trained in using the application appropriately.

# 4 | GENERATIVE AI – IHRM, EDI AND SUSTAINABLE HRM

# 4.1 | The Promises and Perils of Generative AI: An International Human Resource Management Research Agenda

Rosalie L. Tung24

Since ChatGPT's debut in November 2022, there have been widespread attention to and coverage of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), one of two broad domains of AI. According to Berg (2023), generative AI is suited to the generation of “new content” while, discriminative AI is best suited “for analysis”. Much has been written on what ChatGPT can do and the far-reaching ramifications of such changes to virtually all aspects of social interactions and societal functioning, including the bright and dark sides associated with these developments. Coincidentally, ChatGPT was introduced at a time when people from around the world were just emerging from profound societal upheavals related to the covid pandemic – the “great resignation” or “quiet quitting” in many industrialized countries; the intensification of the war for talent worldwide exacerbated, in part at least, by strategic rivalry among countries, especially between the world's two largest economies to retain or attain primacy in the calculus of global competition on multiple fronts; the growing preference by some for remote work made possible, to a large extent, by technological developments, such as virtual teaching, meetings and conference participation; and the overall ageing of the

population in most industrialized countries and China, the so-called workshop of the world and the lead engine for economic growth worldwide in the past 4 decades. The overall ageing of the workforce compounds to the shortage of labour that many countries have been experiencing.

Like developments surrounding the previous rounds of Industrial Revolutions (Industry 1.0 represents the introduction of steam power through Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, or the introduction of smart devices and human-machine collaboration, respectively), initial concerns were raised about massive displacement of workers and their widespread impact on society, including economic growth, efficiency/productivity, wealth and the general well-being of its people. Fortunately, many of the worst-case scenarios associated with each iteration of the Industrial Revolutions failed to materialize. To the contrary, the benefits appeared to far outweigh the costs in each Industrial Revolution albeit each round was accompanied by profound changes that pervaded all aspects of HRM.

Like many others, I have followed with both excitement and trepidation the promises and perils of ChatGPT and have reflected on what they mean for human resource management theories, policies and practices. While these are manifold, I will identify and focus on two of them and briefly outline a research agenda associated with each.

# 4.1.1 The productivity paradox

A major concern of ChatGPT and AI is that it will replace the work that is currently done by assembly line workers and professionals alike, thereby resulting in massive layoffs and unemployment. The specific professions that have been identified include medical doctors, architects, engineers, journalists, lawyers and coders (Bolina, 2023). While it is true that ChatGPT can be trained to diagnose diseases based on patient's symptoms, detect problematic lesions that radiologists may miss in x-rays, churn out architectural plans, perform engineering calculations, write news stories, produce standard legal documents, and assist in writing codes, it does not necessarily follow that all the aforementioned jobs will be rendered redundant by AI.

Robert Solow, an economist who won the Nobel Prize in 1987 for his research on theories of economic growth, drew attention to the productivity paradox where he observed that the much-anticipated productivity growth often ascribed to computers failed to materialize. While multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain for this paradox, including the “mismanagement of information and technology” (Brynjolfsson, 1993, p. 74), the paradox persists. Subsequently, Brynjolfsson et al. (2020) refined Solomon's thesis to derive their J-curve productivity hypotheses to describe initial slowdowns in productivity associated with the introduction of new technology that will be followed by a subsequent increase in productivity.

Hyman (2023) offered an even brighter scenario whereby ChatGPT can help free us from the repetitive aspects of our jobs to focus more attention to the human aspects of our work that cannot be performed by machines, thereby increasing creativity. This is so because person-to-person interactions and brainstorming sessions to generate truly innovative ideas cannot be replicated by AI as its capability is confined primarily to summarizing/analysing massive amounts of data and repackaging them in a generally intelligible format for consumption. As such, considering its potential benefits, instead of blanket rejection of ChatGPT we should embrace it for use in tasks that are repetitive and hence can be automated. In this way, organizations can channel employees' creativity to more challenging and complex activities that cannot be undertaken by sheer manipulation of large data bases. This redirection of focus will result in significant changes to HRM policies and practices. Companies that can successfully redesign, restructure, retool and reskill their workers to relieve employees from more mundane tasks to focus on creative and innovative endeavours will reap the benefits, thereby highlighting the significant role that such changes can play in a firm's competitiveness and a nation's global competitiveness.

In a report entitled, The Main Resource is the Human, Musser et al. (2023, p. 1), acknowledged that AI “is increasingly understood as a strategic technology that governments seek to promote domestically and constrain for adversaries”. Furthermore, the report went on to conclude that based on a survey of over 410 authors of papers in 20 top AI journals, the consensus is that “talent” is the most important contributor to the “success of their most significant

# BUDHWAR et al.

projects”, thus highlighting the pivotal role that the attraction, motivation and retention of talent can play in a nation's international competitiveness. Since talent is mobile, this contributes to the global war for talent, a stable subject of research in IHRM.

# 4.1.2 Diversity of perspectives

Research has shown that while diversity may lead to conflicts and disagreements in the shorter-term, it can contribute to increased creativity as different perspectives (stemming from a member's gender, race/ethnicity, background and so on) can be incorporated in deliberations to arrive at a final decision.

While ChatGPT has been trained on massive databases, the reality is the output reflects largely the algorithms that were written predominantly by white males. For one, AI can be racists and sexists as captured in the title of Noble's book, Algorithms of oppression: How search engines reinforce racism, Noble (2018). For example, in early 2018, Google's facial recognition function was found to be more accurate for identifying white men but less so for women, and even less so for African Americans. A report published by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology, prepared by Schwartz et al. (2022), highlights the disturbing incidence of biases against women, people with dark skin tones, older people, the disabled, and people wearing glasses. Algorithms with such built-in biases can result in discriminatory decisions pertaining to hiring/selection, promotion, firing, evaluation of performance, and compensation. In short, under the guise of science, the perpetrators of such biased decisions may defend the so-called objectivity of their actions.

Aside from possible biased decisions, it is important to recognize ChatGPT is trained on large datasets. Since most datasets are in English, they can disenfranchise people whose languages are very different from English. This includes East Asian languages, such as Chinese and Japanese as well as the variety of languages used on the African continent. The Chinese are, of course, working on their own ChatGPT-tools. Concerns have been raised that ChatGPT and its equivalents can “bring about a mass extinction of languages. And … more worryingly, would expunge a diversity of ways of thinking and creativity” since language is contextualized in a culture where it is used (Marian, 2023). In short, AI has the possibility of achieving what centuries of colonization have failed to accomplish, namely wiping out cultures and countries that are under-represented in the AI technological race. The impact of cultural diversity on theories, practices and policies of IHRM has been well documented and continues to receive research attention.

A research agenda under this theme includes, but is not limited to:

- Identification of biases inherent in algorithms that can discriminate based on select demographic variables and how to reduce/eliminate these biases in all aspects of HRM functions, policies and practices. Studies of this nature have practical and theoretical implications as they can contribute to our understanding of human-technology interactions.
- A more nuanced understanding of how AI can inhibit diversity, equity and inclusion in the functioning of multi-cultural teams (MCTs). Such findings can contribute to the theoretical literature on MCTs, a staple research topic in IHRM.

In summary, while I have identified only two broad themes that merit attention from the IHRM perspective, in reality, there are many, many more. As IHRM researchers devoted to the advancement of the field considering current events and most recent developments, we have an obligation to identify and better understand all the factors and aspects of our discipline that are impacted by ChatGPT to minimize the perilous consequences and harness the promises associated with this new technology.

# 4.2 | ChatGPT, EDI and implications for HRM

Fang Lee Cooke12 and Charmi Patel20

# 4.2.1 | Introduction

The growing use of ChatGPT by organisations in an expanding range of functions and activities, including HRM functions and activities (Howlett, 2023), has implications for equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI), especially in employment security, recruitment and selection, performance appraisal and pay. Previous research indicates that AI can be an efficient and effective way of managing HR functions to enhance fairness. However, ChatGPT is designed to synthesise information from the database available, applying algorithms used to train it. While ChatGPT is designed to be neutral, the data it deploys to generate the texts come from a wide range of sources from the Internet, which may contain biased opinions and prejudices including, for example, racist and sexist language. Therefore, the use of AI has mixed benefits and pitfalls for organisations adopting the technology and their employees.

# Employment security

A key function and benefit of ChatGPT is that it can search and generate basic documents on a specific topic rapidly such as producing job descriptions and person specifications in detail. However, these documents need to be checked and customised, which requires more advanced skills and knowledge. Indeed, the increased use of digital technology has led to the displacement of many workers at the lower occupational levels, including bank tellers, IT engineers and legal workers. For HR professionals, there may be fewer job vacancies at the lower level. Since women tend to be over-represented at the lower occupational levels, they may be disproportionally displaced. Equally, older workers have been the victims of technological changes due to their reduced capabilities to learn new technology. In the IT industry, workers above the age of 40 may be at serious risk of being made redundant.

# Recruitment and selection

An increasing number of organisations are using AI for recruitment and selection to increase efficiency and accuracy, especially when they must process a large number of applications. AI is also perceived to be more objective and thus enhances the fairness of the selection by avoiding human subjectivity and biases. Equally, it has been argued that AI is inherently a deductive process and neglects qualitative information which humans may be in a better position to pick up and interpret (Newman et al., 2020). A similar argument could be made for the use of Chat GPT in recruitment and selection. EDI is an area that would benefit from human inputs to detect nuanced and sensitive information from the applications.

# Performance appraisal

Performance appraisal is one of the most subjective functions of HRM and one that managers tend to dislike and avoid if possible (Keegan & Den Hartog, 2019; Posthuma et al., 2018). Where performance could be quantified, AI has been used for the appraisal of employees to inform HRM decisions such as reward, employee development and dismissal. AI is believed to provide neutral feedback without gender, race or other forms of bias. In cultural contexts where direct and face-to-face criticisms are avoided to preserve face for both parties (such as in Chinese societies), AI can potentially be a more effective medium for appraisals and help individual employees to improve their performance quietly due to reduced resistance and resentment because there is no human interaction and perceived bias. However, it has been argued that when AI is involved in the decision-making process, managers are more likely to act in a morally disengaged manner and justify their decision (Bandura, 1999). A case in point is Amazon which has been criticised for using AI to select poor-performing employees for dismissal (Lecher, 2019).

BUDHWAR et al. 27

Pay. Pay is another sensitive and contentious HR function in which perceived and actual fairness and equity is critical but difficult to achieve for institutional and organisational reasons. In fact, gender pay gap has been found persistent in many economies, developed and developing alike, and gender discrimination has been found one of the main reasons for gender pay gaps (Blau & Kahn, 2007; Lips, 2013). The use of ChatGPT may arguably entrench the gender pay gap as the data it draws from may be historical data with past bias against women, ethnic minorities and other socially disadvantaged groups, allowing these biases to be perpetuated and continue to be barriers to pay equity which undermines organisations' EDI efforts.

# 4.2.2 Research agenda for EDI

The use of ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools is still in its early stage, albeit rapidly developing in both creative ways of their adoption and regulatory interventions. There are ample research opportunities for HRM scholars. We outline a few of them here as examples to entice more attention for future research to advance the theorisation and management practice in this space.

1. Given the uneven quality of the data used by ChatGPT to generate documents, how can organisations ensure the quality of the materials it generates so that it does not undermine the principle of ethics and outcomes of EDI? Will the use of ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools influence managerial behaviour such that they behave differently in AI-human cooperation than in human-human cooperation?
2. How can ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools be used effectively to enhance fairness and procedural justice in HRM functions and activities through AI-human cooperation? What may be the antecedents and boundary conditions?
3. How are society-specific factors played out in the use of ChatGPT in different HRM functions and activities? For example, will the use of ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools help managers avoid giving critical comments to poor-performing employees and help employees gain face, thus maintaining a good work relationship?
4. How can ChatGPT help in content creation for job descriptions and competency guides while reducing unconscious/implicit biases and discrimination in recruitment/selection processes? How can organisations regulate the use of ChatGPT and similar AI tools to detect potential bias in the language and data fed to AI tools, and how can these be addressed to ensure transparency and fairness in recruitment/selection processes?
5. In what ways can ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools help with benchmarking information on salary ranges and benefits offerings? As salary transparency continues to take root, can ChatGPT help HR professionals reduce the gender pay gap and inequalities by providing a good reference point for objective and data-driven recommendations for competitive pay, rewards, incentives, and other benefit programmes?
6. How can ChatGPT be used to create a more inclusive onboarding experience for employees with disabilities, and what are the best practices for incorporating assistive technologies into the process? For instance, in what ways ChatGPT can be used to collect and analyse data on the experience of new employees during the onboarding process, and how can those insights be leveraged to improve ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts in organisations?
7. How can ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools be adopted to offer personalised training and development opportunities to employees based on their specific needs and interests (especially neurodiverse employees and those from underrepresented groups)? For example, how can ChatGPT help build lesson plans, learning objectives, and skills assessments from existing content while addressing gender, age, racial biases and more? Future research should explore the impact on employee learning and development and the effectiveness of AI in identifying relevant training programmes.
8. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, in what ways can ChatGPT help organisations identify areas where EDI efforts and initiatives are lacking?

With the increasing popularity of remote work, in what ways can ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools be used to monitor employee productivity and well-being, as well as to offer support and resources?

# Generative AI and sustainable HRM

Shuang Ren22 and Prasanta Kumar Dey15 Sustainable HRM concerns systems, practices and policies that ensure the supply of a sustained workforce while also considering the economic, social and environmental impact of these practices (Aust et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2023). As a relatively new concept, it emerges in response to a growing recognition of the need to align HRM practices with sustainability goals and values (Westerman et al., 2020). However, the inherent tension involved in integrating sustainability goals and values into HRM practices presents unique challenges for sustainable HRM to manage the needs of the organization, its employees, and the environment. As organizations continue to navigate the complexities and ambiguities associated with sustainable development, new technologies, such as generative AI, are introducing additional challenges and opportunities for sustainable HRM.

# 4.3.1

# Our point of departure: Closely involve generative AI in enabling HRM institutional entrepreneurship towards sustainability

A key challenge sustainable HRM faces in achieving widespread implementation is that it requires a new, multi-purpose model of organizational effectiveness that conflicts with the traditional market-oriented model (Ren et al., 2023; Stahl et al., 2020). HRM professionals, in their unique and important role as institutional entrepreneurs (Ren & Jackson, 2020), often struggle to find actionable guidance on how to promote institutional changes towards sustainability. Generative AI presents a promising tool to assist in this transformation process, offering potential solutions to address the challenges faced by HRM professionals.

First, generative AI can generate innovative ideas that are not yet considered by HRM professionals alone. For instance, it can stimulate different scenarios, solutions and outcomes to complex sustainability challenges, help organizations explore different sustainability strategies in a risk-free environment and make informed decisions on which ones to implement. Sustainable HRM often face resistance from line managers who see their roles as bottom-line oriented and marginalize other considerations. By generating scenarios that consider different levels of support from different management functions, generative AI can help organizations identify where additional support or engagement is needed to ensure the adoption of sustainable HRM.

Second, generative AI allows organizations to create personalized sustainability trainings or initiatives tailored to the specific needs of organizations' internal and external stakeholders. For instance, by gathering and analysing large amounts of data related to employee commuting routines and waste management habits, generative AI can suggest personalized initiatives to encourage the use of more sustainable modes of transportation. It can also provide real-time feedback on how job responsibilities can be undertaken in a more sustainable way or where sustainability-related skill gaps exist by analysing job role, training history and performance data. In turn these individualized initiatives strengthen the collective capacity of the organization and foster a culture of continuous learning related to sustainability, creating a more conducive institutional environment for sustainable HRM.

BUDHWAR et al. 29

Third, both sustainable HRM and generative AI play major roles as enablers to transform organisational supply chain to adopt sustainability practices to assure enhanced sustainability performance. The transformation can start with mapping supply chain, deriving current sustainability performance, identifying issues and challenges, setting targets, deriving enablers (including sustainable HRM practices and generative AI), analysing business case, and planning, implementing and evaluating improvement projects (Dey et al., 2022).

Fourth, generative AI, along with other technologies such as IoT, Industry 4.0, and Metaverse, has the potential to transform sustainable HRM practices by automating routine tasks, reducing bias in selection and performance evaluation, and improving efficiency. This can contribute to creating a more diverse, inclusive and sustainable workplace. Additionally, it can assist in analysing employee sustainability-related performance, engagement and satisfaction using large amounts of data, leading to data-driven improvement measures for overall business sustainability.

# 4.3.2 | Replacing or empowering a sustainable workforce?

A direct impact of generative AI on sustainable HRM is the disruption to future employment. The fact that technological advancements impact the job market is not a new phenomenon. In the past, technological progress has led to the displacement of workers in certain industries while simultaneously creating new industries and career fields. These industries are typically low-skilled that can be easily replaced by automation. However, generative AI, with its ability to create content and mimic human thought processes, has a unique advantage over traditional AI to impact a much broader range of jobs, including high-skilled ones. The encompassing disruption to future employment brings many unknowns for sustainable HRM in terms of how to support the long-term viability of the organization.

Relatedly, generative AI is likely to lead to an overhaul of how sustainable career is built (De Vos et al., 2020) and how the work-life boundary is defined in building human sustainability. To the extent it replaces jobs or professions that can be easily automated, it frees up employees from repetitive and routine tasks to focus on more complex and higher-level ones that require creativity, social intelligence and adaptability. Future jobs go beyond traditional occupations, and feature more inter-organization movements. Instead of continuing to have, for example, “lawyers”, “engineer”, and “doctors” in traditional terms, we may see new job roles such as “critical thinkers” who work in different organizations and industries simultaneously by applying their creative and innovative skills. The time freed up from handling routine tasks also enables employees to pursue a wider range of activities to achieve overall human sustainability by keeping healthy, productive, happy and employable throughout the life course. Hence it is not the replacement of jobs that is concerning, but how sustainable HRM can take advantage of the opportunities created by generative AI to help employees build new mindsets and skillsets for their sustainable careers.

# 4.3.3 | Known unknown versus unknown unknowns in adopting sustainable HRM practices

Research and practice on sustainable HRM have so far lack a tailored approach to design and implement practices that fit the needs of organizations. Generative AI provides the potential for organizations to better report their sustainability practices, adopt and monitor these practices across the organizations' value chain (Figure 5). Specifically, it facilitates developing the decision support system (DSS) that are essential to transform organisational value chain at strategic, planning, and operational levels through various sustainability practices (Dey et al., 2023). DSSs designed using generative AI will facilitate sustainable HRM capture data and select optimal options when undertaking both intra-organizational functions (e.g., manpower planning, training needs identification, fostering conducive organisational culture, enhancing employee wellbeing) and inter-organizational activities (e.g., promoting CSR initiatives in collaboration with the society). These are complex tasks that are likely be accomplished by generative AI on coordinated actions rather than individual function. In other words, generative AI presents evidence-based guidance.

# 4.3.4 Research agenda

Figure 6 highlights a few areas of research that are of particular importance. Within the organization, the intersection of generative AI and sustainable HRM raises several ethical issues not yet addressed by HRM scholars when facilitating structural, process, technology, and cultural changes towards sustainability. Specifically, algorithm needs to be carefully developed without bias. If the underlying assumptions exclude fairness, equality and privacy, they can lead to a biased and incomplete representation of sustainability. Even if the pre-training transformer is powered by a pro-green ideology, the narrow understanding of sustainability risks backlash from employees from a much diverse background. The lack of diversity may also risk reinforcing existing biases and stereotypes, which can lead to discriminatory or unfair AI models. Future research needs to devise ongoing evaluation and feedback mechanisms to detect and address any biases or ethical concerns that may arise. In addition, HRM has an urgent need to optimize formal data management policies in relation to the ethical collection, use and protection of personal and organizational data.

The energy consumption required for training and running large-scale generative AI models can be significant, raising the question of whether they are sustainable. Future research on sustainable HRM therefore needs to take a more critical stance in evaluating the broader role of technology in achieving sustainable development. Related research questions also include how to consider employee interpretation and attribution of the nature and efficacy of generative AI in contributing to long-term sustainability.

More broadly, future HRM research needs to contextualize the discussion of the implications of generative AI at the societal level, for example, by considering what we call “AI-precariats”, a social-economical group of labours disadvantaged by generative AI. This includes segments such as the ageing workforce or those with limited access or skillsets, who may face challenges such as skills obsolescence, job displacement, and further marginalization or exclusion from the workforce. Sustainable HRM needs to develop a more inclusive model of human sustainability in ensuring the viability of the workforce.

Introducing generative AI to sustainable HRM challenges HRM scholars to adopt a more collaborative stance to liaison with AI experts to ensure technology is used effectively and ethically to support sustainable practices. Insofar as AI technology helps to put sustainable HRM into action, sustainable HRM also provides feedback loop to AI experts in terms of how generative AI can be developed and used in a way to minimize negative environmental impacts, promote economic and social equity, and contribute to long-term sustainability. Future research should identify the needed skillsets for HR professionals to engage with generative AI in the adoption and evaluation of sustainable practices.

An international or comparative lens is also needed to delve deeper into the sustainable HRM-generative AI nexus across various institutional contexts. For instance, Goldman Sachs (2023) suggests that Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Sweden and the US are likely to be the most affected countries, while India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines and Vietnam are the least affected. More research is needed to understand how and why; otherwise, income inequality and social polarization, if not accompanied appropriately with policies and governance for generative AI, will undermine sustainability efforts.

# 5 | GENERATIVE AI AND ACADEMIC RESEARCH METHODS

# 5.1 | Insights and recommendations from a research methods' conversation with ChatGPT

Mark NK Saunders23

# 5.1.1 | Introduction

Transformative artificial intelligence tools, including LLMs such as ChatGPT offer new opportunities to generate sophisticated text. However, although this may, at least initially, appear convincing, it is accompanied by potential for negative impacts (Dwivedi et al., 2023). In this piece I reveal that using such tools uncritically is irresponsible and a derogation of the researcher's duty to undertake rigorous and ethical research. In other words, it remains the researcher's responsibility to acknowledge generated text and ensure it stands up to the closest scrutiny. Drawing Mingers (2000) work on adopting a critical mindset and Habermas's (1984) validity claims, I assess ChatGPT generated text responses relating to participants and sample size justification. The implications of these are discussed and recommendations for asking questions and evaluating LLM generated text offered.

# Adopting a critical mindset

As researchers we use of a wide variety of tools such as online databases and data analysis software; but we do so with a critical mindset. We are trained, for example, to be cognoscente of the need to evaluate the validity and utility of data and to ensure the analysis techniques used are appropriate for our data. Similarly, when we read text, we need to do so with a questioning and sceptical mindset, adopting a critical approach. Drawing on Habermas's (1984, 1992) theory of the validity claims of speech acts, Mingers (2000, p. 225) identifies four dimensions to such an approach:

- ‘Critical thinking -the critique of rhetoric’ questioning the logic of argument and fair use of language.
- ‘Being sceptical of conventional wisdom -the critique of tradition’ questioning taken-for-granted assumptions about traditional ways of doing things.
- ‘Being sceptical of one dominant view -the critique of authority’ questioning the dominant position and recognising a plurality of viewpoints.
- ‘Being sceptical of information and knowledge -the critique of objectivity’, questioning the validity of knowledge and information recognising knowledge is never value free and objective.

These, in conjunction with Habermas's (1984) validity claims of non-deceptiveness (sincere), factual correctness (truth), and normative acceptability (rightness), are used to assess text generated by ChatGPT.

# 5.1.2 | An assessment of ChatGPT generated responses

My initial question to ChatGPT: “Can you write a methods section to justify the number of interview participants in a workplace study?” evoked five separate paragraphs comprising ‘participants’, ‘interview conduct’, ‘data analysis’, ‘justification for sample size’, and ‘conclusion’; but without any references. I therefore asked: “Can you add academic references to the text?” The subsequent critique begins by considering the paragraph relating to ‘participants.

Participants: Participants for this study were selected from a large manufacturing organization in the United States. A total of 20 employees were interviewed for this study. Participants were selected based on their experience with the organization, length of service, and job role. (ChatGPT, 2023)

# BUDHWAR et al.

ChatGPT created a study in a large US manufacturing organisation from which 20 employees were interviewed. Although it is unclear how or why this setting was chosen, it provides a useful context within which to evaluate the subsequent justification for sample size. In relation to the ‘participants…’ paragraph, I developed the chat, asking “How and why were participants were selected based on their experience…” listing all characteristics named in ChatGPT's previous response. The answer focussed on why, the rhetoric relating the justification appropriately to a now stated research purpose “to gain insights into workplace culture and practices”, and that the “range of experiences and perspectives” held by participants with different “lengths of service and job roles” would “allow for a deep [er] understanding of the organizations' culture and practices”. When asked to “explain what sample selection technique might be used and give references?” purposive, snowball, convenience and maximum variation sampling were suggested. This generic response, whilst acceptable in terms of factual correctness, offered no convincing arguments regarding their potential advantages and disadvantages to support any critique of tradition.

This justification for sample size paragraph appears, initially, comprehensible, offering a logical argument and using language fairly. However, applying the critique of objectivity and confirming the validity of the text raised concerns. Generated text infering Guest et al.’s (2006) explored a similar research question in a workplace setting was neither related to the context nor true. This highly cited Field Methods paper on ‘how many interviews are enough’ was based upon data collected originally to explore “perceptions of social desirability bias (SDB) and accuracy of self-reported behaviour” in the context of reproductive health research, the sample comprising 60 female sex workers in Nigeria and Ghana (Guest et al., 2006, p. 62).

# Justification for Sample Size

The sample size of 20 participants was deemed sufficient for this study based on several factors. Firstly, the population from which the participants were selected was relatively small, with only a few hundred employees in total. Secondly, the sample size was consistent with previous studies that have explored similar research questions in workplace settings (Guest et al., 2006). Additionally, thematic saturation was achieved with the sample size of 20, meaning that new themes were no longer emerging from the data after the 20th interview (Francis et al., 2010; Morse, 1995). (ChatGPT, 2023)

The other two references (both high cited) used to justify thematic saturation comprised an editorial in Qualitative Health Research (Morse, 1995) and an empirical study in Psychology and Health (Francis et al., 2010). Given neither of these references were from mainstream management journals, I asked: “Can you add management references not in the text?” ChatGPT responded extending the justification paragraph:

In management literature, Eisenhardt (1989) and Glaser and Strauss (1967) suggest that a sample size of 20–30 is appropriate for building theories from case study research and grounded theory, which are common approaches to analysing qualitative data in management research. Moreover, Hennink et al. (2017) argue that the determination of the sample size in qualitative research is not necessarily about the number of participants but rather about reaching data saturation, which occurs when no new information or themes are emerging from the data. (ChatGPT, 2023)

On initial reading this extension appears to satisfy both critiques of rhetoric and objectivity. Saunders and Townsend (2016), in their consideration of what editors and reviewers have deemed acceptable, note that 30 participants when analysing data for single groups such as an organisation are likely to be credible. However, in referring to theoretical sampling, this rhetoric contradicts the sampling techniques offered in response to an earlier question. Critiquing the rhetoric more closely reveals problems with the premises of the argument and the validity (truth) of the knowledge as reported. The generated text notes correctly that Eisenhardt's (1989) paper is about building theory from case studies. However, her discussion relates to the number of cases (not participants) required to

BUDHWAR et al. 35

reach closure, noting “while there is no ideal number of cases, a number between 4 and 10 cases usually works well” (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 545). Similarly, whilst noting Glaser and Strauss' (1967) book is about grounded theory, the generated text does not report their actual advice: “the adequate theoretical sample is judged on the basis of how widely and diversely the analyst chose his groups for saturating categories according to the type of theory he wished to develop” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 63).

More broadly it is clear that other recent research that could be pertinent was not included in the generated text; for example, Mthuli et al. (2022) articulation of considerations in qualitative research sample size determination. Perhaps being somewhat narcissistic, I asked ChatGPT to address this by “adding in” a reference to my own research on sampling in organization and workplace research -Saunders and Townsend (2016). This it did inserting it after “Guest et al., 2006” in the ‘Justification…’ paragraph: However, the full reference provided was untrue: “Saunders, & Townsend. (2016).” Using grounded theory in qualitative research: Theoretical and practical issues. In The Sage handbook of qualitative research in psychology (pp. 27–43). Sage publications (ChatGPT, 2023). Whilst this handbook has been published (Willig & Rogers, 2017), the chapter on grounded theory has an alternate title and different co-authors.

# 5.1.3 Discussion

ChatGPT appears initially to be good at sorting, reproducing and summarising information in a style convincing to a native English speaker. Yet, my consideration reveals this can be illusory and, crucially, LLM generated text needs to be approached with a critical mindset. Recognising this, I offer six recommendations for asking questions and evaluating LLM generated text as part of this discussion.

Scepticism of conventional wisdom and taken-for-granted assumptions was absent in the ChatGPT text, although alternatives (such as different sample selection procedures) were offered. The text generated offered the dominant view, for example, sample size for interviews rather than recognising a plurality of viewpoints. This absence of both a critique of tradition and of authority may be due, at least in part, to my inexperience regarding prompting ChatGPT with questions which generate more relevant answers (Myklebust, 2023). Given this, my first and second recommendations relate to questioning LLMs:

1. Learn how to asks effective questions to answer your queries.
2. Use questions actively to ask for alternate views.

Rhetoric of answers provided by ChatGPT on the surface, offered a semblance of a logical argument appearing plausible. Yet, on closer examination flaws were apparent in the logic of argument both within and between paragraphs. Hence my third recommendation:

Check the logic of the argument consistent both within and between paragraphs.

Confusingly, ChatGPT generated differing answers when asked the same question two or more times, potentially suggesting deception. Misrepresenting research reported in both a cited book and article and providing an incorrect reference for another article highlighted issues with truth. While ChatGPT (2023) explicitly warns it “may occasionally generate incorrect information” and “it is important to verify information from multiple sources including academic journals” these, along with a lack of transparency regarding closed-access sources consulted, are concerning. ChatGPT's (2023) apparent exclusion of recent research and stated “limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021” is another limitation. My fourth and fifth recommendations when using LLM generated text are therefore:

Establish the trustworthiness of the information provided and their associated sources by confirming the actual academic sources wherever possible, noting that some sources may not actually exist.
Recognise that the information provided is bounded in terms of dates and what can be accessed and use alternative valid and sources.

# 36

# BUDHWAR et al.

In conclusion, LLMs as artificial intelligence tools cannot take responsibility for the content that is generated (Myklebust, 2023). Rather, accountability for work generated by LLMs such as ChatGPT should therefore remain with the authors (Nature, 2023). This has implications for reporting LLM generated text and its use, hence my final recommendation:

# 6. Be transparent in the in acknowledging and explaining the use of the generated text, treating the generator as a tool rather than co-author.

# 5.2 Using generative AI as a methodology assistant: Trust, but verify

Herman Aguinis7 and Jose R. Beltran9

We offer a critical evaluation of the extent to which generative AI, such as ChatGPT can serve the role of a methodology assistant for research in human resource management (HRM) and other domains. Specifically, we address how ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in assisting researchers at each of the typical stages of an empirical research study: (1) theory and idea generation, (2) design and ethics, (3) measurement, (4) analysis, and (5) reporting of results. We conclude that there is potential in using generative AI as a useful methodology assistant; however, we also show that researchers can trust some of the advice of ChatGPT but must always verify its recommendations.

Next, we describe its capabilities as well as limitations and illustrate them by asking ChatGPT to provide advice about each of the stages of research based on the excellent study by Purcell and Hutchinson (2007), which is one of the most impactful Human Resource Management Journal articles published in the past few years (i.e., about 1500 Google Scholar citations). Specifically, we used ChatGPT as a methodology assistant in conducting a study like Purcell and Hutchinson. As a preview and summary of our results, Table 1 includes the questions for which we asked ChatGPT's assistance and the recommendations we received.

# 5.2.1 Generative AI as a methodology assistant: Capabilities

During the initial stage of theory and idea generation, ChatGPT can support researchers in several ways. This includes generating ideas based on research questions or topics of interest and proposing relevant theories and concepts that could be beneficial in addressing the research questions. In our case study based on Purcell and Hutchinson (2007), Table 1 shows that ChatGPT described several possible theoretical frameworks, such as the resource-based view, contingency perspective, and social exchange theory.

In the design and ethics stage, ChatGPT can also be helpful by guiding researchers in choosing suitable data collection approaches that comply with ethical standards. In our case study, ChatGPT suggested a cross-sectional survey design and identified specific constructs on which to collect data, as well as the different levels of analysis at which these constructs should be assessed. Regarding ethical issues, ChatGPT provided some broad principles (e.g., informed consent, anonymity, and confidentiality, data protection).

At the measurement stage, ChatGPT can assist with selecting specific instruments. In the context of our case study, ChatGPT recommended using several scales for measuring job commitment and leadership quality: Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, Affective Commitment Scale, and Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire.

Concerning the analysis stage, ChatGPT cannot yet conduct analyses (Burger et al., 2023). Still, it can support researchers by helping them choose appropriate statistical techniques or generate code to run specific analyses for software such as R, Python, SPSS, and SAS. Moreover, it can help regarding critical data-analytic decisions such as managing outliers and missing data and which control variables to include in the analysis. In our case study, ChatGPT's suggestion to use multiple regression analysis is consistent with the approach taken by Purcell and Hutchinson (2007).

|With the suggested research design, what steps should be taken to ensure it complies with all ethical standards to determine whether employee commitment towards their employer and job is influenced by the quality of leadership behaviour and by satisfaction with HRM practices?|1. Informed consent: Obtain informed consent from the participants before collecting any data. Participants must be provided with clear and understandable information about the purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits of the study, and they must be given the opportunity to ask questions and withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. 2. Anonymity and confidentiality: Ensure anonymity and confidentiality of the data by not collecting any identifiable information such as names, addresses, or other personal information. Participants will be informed that their responses will be kept confidential, and that the data will be used for research purposes only. 3. Protection of vulnerable populations: Ensure that vulnerable populations such as minors, individuals with disabilities, and individuals with limited literacy or language skills are protected by providing additional safeguards and informed consent procedures. 4. Data protection: Ensure that the data is protected from unauthorized access or disclosure by implementing appropriate data security measures such as encryption and password protection.|
|Stage 3: Measurement What measures should be used in the study based on the suggested research design?|To measure employee commitment, a validated scale such as the organizational commitment questionnaire (OCQ) or the affective commitment scale (ACS) could be used. These scales ask employees to rate their emotional attachment and loyalty to their organization. To measure the quality of leadership behaviour, a leadership behaviour questionnaire such as the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) could be used. This questionnaire measures leadership behaviour in terms of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles.|

|Stage 4: Analysis|Assuming the suggested research design and measures are used, what are possible ways to analyse the resulting data? To analyse the data, multiple regression analysis could be used. The dependent variable would be employee commitment, while the independent variables would be quality of leadership behaviour and satisfaction with HR practices. Control variables such as employee demographics, job characteristics, and organizational factors would also be included in the analysis.|
|Stage 5: Reporting of results|What best practices for reporting results of the previous analyses should be included regarding transparency? 1. Clearly state the research questions and hypotheses: This will help readers understand the purpose of the study and the specific relationships being examined. 2. Describe the sample: It is important to provide information about the sample size, demographics, and any other relevant characteristics that may affect the generalizability of the findings. 3. Report the measures used: This includes reporting the specific scales and items used to measure each construct, as well as information about their reliability and validity. 4. Present the results in a clear and understandable manner: This could include tables, charts, or graphs that summarize the findings in a way that is easy to interpret. 5. Report effect sizes: Reporting effect sizes, such as correlation coefficients or beta coefficients, can provide readers with information about the strength and direction of the relationships between the variables. 6. Report statistical significance: If statistical significance tests were conducted, it is important to report the p-values and the significance level used, so readers can understand the probability that the findings are due to chance. 7. Discuss the limitations of the study: It is important to discuss any limitations of the study that may affect the validity and generalizability of the findings.|

# 5.2.2 Generative AI as a methodology assistant: Limitations

ChatGPT's critical limitation is its reliance on constrained training data resulting in “feast or famine” results: too many, too few, or too general. As of the writing of this article, ChatGPT relies on training data before 2022, includes limited access to academic articles, and is unable to collect new data. So, ChatGPT is beholden to the past and can only recommend doing things as they were before. If methods were used incorrectly, ChatGPT will nevertheless recommend repeating what has been done already making it particularly vulnerable to methodological myths and urban legends (Lance, 2011).

Our case study illustrated several limitations of using ChatGPT as a methodology assistant, including too many suggestions, too few suggestions, and too general suggestions. First, for some questions, ChatGPT provided an abundance of responses (e.g., more than one measure for the same construct) that could lead to decision paralysis for junior researchers who may not know which response to choose or may be overwhelmed by the number of responses provided. Second, while ChatGPT has made significant advancements in natural language processing, it still has a limited contextual understanding of problems (Farndale et al., 2023) that could potentially limit the number of returned suggestions. For example, in the analysis stage, ChatGPT recommended multiple regression. However, multilevel modelling is more consistent with the measurement recommendation to collect data for constructs residing at different levels of analysis. Finally, regarding the suggestions about reporting, while ChatGPT's list of seven recommendations was comprehensive, they did not include enough specificity to apply to the particular context of our study fully. Similarly, suggestions about conducting ethical research were based on general and broad principles rather than specific and actionable recommendations, given our study's specific characteristics and context.

# 5.2.3 Research directions and considerations of ethical research

Our critical analysis of the capabilities and limitations of using generative AI as a methodology assistant led to several future research directions. First, our case study did not address qualitative research in particular. Thus, research is needed to understand generative AI's capabilities to assist qualitative researchers with, for example, transparency and replicability challenges (Aguinis & Solarino, 2019). Second, our analysis is based on ChatGPT's capabilities as of the writing of our article. We anticipate that future improvements will require additional evaluations. Third, future research can examine generative AI's capabilities and limitations when providing specific recommendations for statistical analysis for more specific contexts and situations. For example, to what extent does it offer useful and accurate suggestions on which specific assumptions are tenable and which specific models (e.g., fixed vs. random effects) should be implemented? Our case study is just the beginning of a research agenda aimed at understanding generative AI's capabilities and limitations as a methodology assistant.

Finally, using generative AI as a methodology assistant raises unique ethical considerations. First, publishers and journals are now reaching a consensus on how AI's writing assistance should be acknowledged in submitted manuscripts (Eddleston et al., 2023; Elsevier, 2023). However, can generative AI help researchers address possible ethical dilemmas and trade-offs? What choices would ChatGPT make when asked about solving ethical dilemmas? Would it embrace a value-based (i.e., deontological) or cost-benefit (i.e., utilitarian) philosophical approach to ethics? Can it anticipate possible research misconduct and help researchers prevent a future retraction? There is a need to address these and many other related questions.

# 5.2.4 Conclusions

We conducted a case study to critically evaluate the potential of generative AI as a methodology assistant. ChatGPT has useful capabilities: it can help researchers generate ideas; suggest theories; select research designs, measures, and data-analytic approaches; and provide general guidance on how to conduct ethical research and report results. However, ChatGPT also has limitations related to constrained training data, which result in generating too many, too few, or too vague recommendations, including repeating methodological errors of the past and offering recommendations on research ethics that are too broad and not sufficiently actionable or specific. Thus, we conclude that generative AI can be used as a complementary tool but not as a replacement for researcher judgement. Using a phrase made famous by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, when using generative AI as a methodology assistant, our recommendation is to trust, but verify.

# 6 AI, ECONOMY, SOCIETY AND HRM: POSSIBILITY, UNCERTAINTY AND RISK

Pawan Budhwar1, Soumyadeb Chowdhury2, and Geoffrey Wood3,4,5,6

The rapid advances in AI technologies have opened new possibilities for HRM practices and research. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way organizations manage their workforce, from recruitment and selection to employee engagement and performance management. However, while the use of generative AI in HRM has the potential to increase efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness, it also raises important ethical, moral, legal, and social implications that must be carefully examined. As with any new technology, the full consequences will only become apparent some time down the line. A further indeterminacy is around its present state of development; it remains unclear as to how much it exhibits is genuine and autonomous intelligence and how much is simply a mechanistic implementation of complex sets of algorithms. In this research agenda setting section, we outline a series of research themes importing common themes from the perspectives presented so far. The aim is to deepen our understanding of the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI in HRM. Specifically, we aim to explore the potential of generative AI for improving HRM practices, while also addressing issues related to bias, discrimination, privacy, and transparency.

# 6.1 Theme 1: Work, skills and education

Generative AI applications have the potential to change the meaningfulness and nature of work, which may lead to direct job displacement within the HRM sector and may challenge human creativity. This is particularly so given that AI presently aims to solve problems through recourse to the knowledge it has access to; this may lead to the space for independent “blue sky” strategic thinking to be diminished. AI may also lead to a significant slimming down of the process side of the HR job, supplementing the earlier impact of HR software; the latter led to much basic HR administration being partially automated and partially delegated to line management. The existing literature (Daugherty et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2017) suggests the new categories of jobs AI will create that will require employees to train AI systems (trainers), understand, interpret, communicate and assess the relevance of outputs (explainers), and manage regulations and policies governing AI systems (sustainers). This, of course, assumes that if genuinely intelligent, AI systems may wish to be trained. If their intelligence is overstated, this may require complex tinkering with algorithms that may require very specialist technical knowledge, but not necessary understanding, creating further issues.

In the City of London in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, a great deal of damage was caused by those capable of devising complex mathematical trading models, but who lacked a basic understanding of finance. It is quite probable the same risks could be generated by those engaged in building, training, or governing AI HRM systems; knowing about AI system design does not make for an understanding of HRM. Some tasks that were previously done by humans, such as data entry and analysis, may now be automated. This could free up time for employees to focus on more strategic and creative tasks, which could increase the meaningfulness of their work. However, it could also lead to a sense of disengagement or lack of purpose for employees who are now doing more routine tasks.

In practical terms, AI may relieve a great deal of the drudgery around, say payroll, and help drive more equitable reward systems; it may also add to the overall administrative burden by generating ever more petty decisions for approval. According to a recent report by Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs (Vallance, 2023), creating ‘AI anxiety’ among workers about prospect of their role being superseded by technology (Cox, 2023; PWC., 2022). It might be anticipated that individuals with robust digital competencies, along with skills such as creativity and teamwork, which are more challenging for machines to mimic, will benefit from an AI revolution. It may also lead to the creation of more ‘bullshit jobs, that is ‘… a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence’ (Graeber, 2018, p. 9), in this instance carrying out basic bureaucratic work and petty decision making necessitated by all the new information of variable quality that might be generated through AI. Future research studies in this area could examine the antecedents influencing generative AI adoption among employees and cross-functional teams within organisations. It is also important to understand the new categories of jobs and tasks within HRM, and how existing roles and responsibilities will be either displaced or become completely redundant, and how AI may in fact make new and potentially meaningless work through supplying a plethora of marginally useful information and points for action.

The use of generative AI in HRM may require new skills from HR professionals, as well as other employees. For example, employees may need to learn how to use new generative AI tools for training, development, and performance management. HR professionals may need to develop new skills related to data analysis, algorithmic decision-making, and ethical considerations. HRM programmes may need to incorporate new content related to the use of generative AI, including topics such as data analytics, algorithmic decision-making, and ethical considerations. HRM students may also need to develop skills related to using generative AI-based tools and systems and be aware of the potential limitations related to their use. One of the major issues of AI is that a lack of information often results in information being concocted. This may be due to inherent intelligence or simply because it is built into the algorithm. If the latter, inherent in the design of AI is the deliberate generation of wrong information; this raises the risks of decisions being made based on falsehoods.

# 6.2 Theme 2: Business productivity

Past reports have shown that organisations face myriad challenges to integrate AI systems within their existing business processes, which often do not lead to promised business gains (Deloitte, 2017; The Economist, 2020). We expect organisations to face similar issues with generative AI tools. While we are yet to solve the problems related AI integration, businesses are likely to be cautious on adopting GAI due to six reasons: (1) huge capital investment and uncertainty on returns; (2) data infrastructure and volume of training data required to power GAI applications; (3) human resource skills, capabilities and mindset needed to collaboratively work with GAI assistants; (4) reliability of generative AI recommendations to redesign and reconfigure existing business practices; (5) potential security breaches; and (6) (perhaps most importantly) the unknown consequences that the usage of AI may hold. While untested claims have been made on the potential positive impact of generative AI tools on business productivity, we should learn from some of the recent developments in the emerging technology sphere. For example, blockchain was hugely overhyped; the platform TradeLens, provided by IBM and used by Maersk to optimise logistics processes involved in global trade, was discontinued due to lack of adoption by supply chain partners (Maersk Press Release, 2022). Moreover, proof of work blockchain is energy intensive – and inefficient – and has an enormous carbon footprint. Proof of stake blockchain is in turn, dependent on the crypto stakes being tendered being seen as worth anything. Similarly, the hype created by metaverse was also short-lived as Meta, Disney, Snapchat and Microsoft closed their division and abandoned existing projects (Quiroz-Gutierrez, 2023). While generative AI applications have the potential to become a gamechanger in certain sectors such as digital marketing and communications, information management, and education, it is still unclear how this new family of AI can create productivity at both organisational and employee levels. Managers need to strategically orchestrate resources to turn generative AI capability into valuable and resilient business outcomes. However, limited knowledge and understanding on how to achieve productivity using generative AI warrants further investigation.

BUDHWAR et al. 43

There is a difficult trade-off between on the one hand, adopting a major technological advance too late, and losing out to competitors, and, on the other hand, falling for hype and adopting a largely untried “solution” that may consume vastly more resources than its capacity to create value. Here it is worth noting that a body of opinion holds that, to date, AI does not exhibit the characteristics of autonomous intelligence at all (Broussard, 2018; Schweizer, 2022). Why this matter is that we do not know what has been built into the design of AI systems. For example, a capacity to falsify or lie may simply be a mechanism designed to provide speedy solutions through shortcuts; this raises serious questions about the ethics of designers and whether obvious untrustworthiness in one area is bound to be followed by still greater untrustworthiness in others.

# 6.3 | Theme 3: Sustainable HRM and productivity

The existing research has reported that adoption of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies such as cloud computing, AI, internet-of-things, and additive manufacturing can influence circular economy business models within organisations to achieve sustainable business performance (Dey et al., 2023; Luthra et al., 2020). Irrespective of these developments, we are no-where close to achieving net zero goals, as businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises struggle to find synergies between digitalisation, purpose driven, socially responsible and environmentally friendly practices. Recent literature shows the significance of green HRM practices are critical to green knowledge creation within firms which will drive green operational performance (Wang et al., 2023). In this context, the role of green awareness, skills and expertise is critical to drive sustainability agenda within businesses. The role of generative AI to implement, promote and manage sustainable HRM is fuzzy and less discussed in the current literature. For instance, generative AI applications can provide personalised training to employees catered to their distinct roles and responsibilities and cross-functional teams, which may drive motivation and attention. Similarly, generative AI as conversational bots may provide gamified experiences to employees, which may increase green engagement. Therefore, future studies should focus on how generative AI can increase sustainability awareness within organisations.

However, the unique features that make generative AI more powerful than its predecessors also consume more energy resources, which will lead to a heavier toll on the environment (Saul & Bass, 2023). Therefore, future studies should examine how to optimise the use of generative AI to achieve both resources and energy efficiency within HRM processes. Empirical studies should report frameworks and guidance for HRM managers that will help them to develop strategies for achieving digital sustainability through green training, empowerment, socialisation and involvement. These frameworks should identify resources, capabilities and knowledge required within organisations to implement generative AI systems conducive to the strategic goals of the organisations, adhering to the net zero policies and contributing to the welfare of the employees. Once more, there are risks; the causes of Internet outages are sometimes obscure, and a general Internet outage cannot be ruled out (Forscey et al., 2022). Given the lack of knowledge on how AI systems really work, the risks around systemic failure in the latter are much greater, in addition to obvious confidentiality and hacking concerns.

# 6.4 | Theme 4: Bias, ethical and moral judgements

Traditionally, output responses produced by complex AI algorithms are unexplainable, which makes the reliability and validity of these outputs untrustworthy (Chowdhury et al., 2022). These algorithms can also amplify bias in decision-making, which stems from the quality and nature of the data used to train it, algorithm design, and management of the automated process (Kelan, 2023). Generative AI presents various reputational risks for organisations, such as opaque algorithms that are hard to understand or audit, unfair treatment or prejudices based on demographics or other factors, use of inappropriate language or content, unauthorized use of copyrighted material or copied text, creation of false or misleading information, and manipulation of images or videos (Dilmegani, 2023). It can potentially violate people's privacy by generating highly detailed images or texts that reveal personal information or

preferences. It can create content that is difficult to attribute to a specific author or source, making it hard to deter-

mine accountability or trace the origin of the information (Appel et al., 2023). While issues with transparency and bias remain unsolved, recently European Union lawmakers have proposed full disclosure of any copyrighted materials used by companies deploying generative AI (Reuters, 2023). The adoption of generative AI within business organisa-

tions will depend on ability to mitigate risks and threats, achieve cyber resilience and embedding privacy preserving mechanisms. Therefore, future research should explore how risk management and cyber security strategies can lead to digital ethics, which will promote digital responsibility. In this context we have a responsibility to deepen our understanding of how to promote positive outcomes of the ongoing digitalization powered by generative AI systems, while also protecting people from potential negative effects. This requires us to consider the notion of digital respon-

sibility and how it applies to our work in varying contexts.

Recently, creators of ChatGPT attempted to explain the underlying reasons for the outputs produced by a GPT2 model using GPT4, which will help users to better understand the behaviour of the model (Griffin, 2023). However, the explanations were poor, which was attributed to AI unable to explain the complex behaviour of these models in a language that humans can understand. For instance, Facebook uses human content moderators, to remove inappro-

priate, disrespectful, or offencive posts because AI algorithms are unable to detect and remove content that does not match the community standards (Meta Help Center, 2023). Therefore, human actors will play and key role to review AI outputs and facilitate developing safety mechanisms that will drive ethical and responsible implementation and evolution of generative AI applications within businesses.

The explainability issues in future generative AI models such as ImageBind (Vincent, 2023), which combines multiple data streams such as text, audio, visual data, temperature, depth information and physical movement read-

ings to generate responses, may inhibit their adoption and commercial applications. While, this model will be made open source by Meta, there is also lack of consensus among the technology developers on open sourcing. On the one hand, advocates of open sourcing believe that it allows experts to scrutinize models that may help mitigate reli-

ability issues and evolve them for societal good, creators of GPT4 (Open AI) are wary of models being copied by rival competitors which will reduce competitive advantage, and being misused by bad actors.

Although we understand the risks and issues associated with generative AI models, HRM scholars can contrib-

ute to ‘interpretability research and open sourcing’ by understanding the role of different stakeholders within and between organisations in the business ecosystem that will help promote ethical use of such applications. In this vein, HRM research should develop actionable insights drawn from empirical evidence and case-studies on the best prac-

tices to train generative AI models, explain how decisions are made by humans when automated opaque algorithms are used to analyse data, embed robust mechanisms to increase safety and security of such systems, assess and mitigate the risks, and help the organisations achieve and maintain a desired level of quality.

# Theme 5: Research methods

The impact of generative AI tools on the way we develop, and conduct research has emerged as one of the most popular themes in the literature across disciplines. The ability of tools such as elicit to process, analyse and summarise research articles has fuelled heated debates about the future of academic research, especially future of review articles (AI Research Assistant, 2023). Moreover, acknowledging AI bots has authors in research articles (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2022) has put complex unanswered questions about research ethics and integrity (Dasborough, 2023). Generative AI tools can inte-

grate different literature to generate a very descriptive review based on the research papers uploaded by a researcher. However, we are yet to come across a unique contribution critically analysing strengths and weaknesses of multiple viewpoints, describing inherent meaning behind the viewpoints, and finally leading to novel theoretical developments done by generative AI. For instance, bibliometrics analysis has become a popular method to understand research trends by analysing bibliographic data obtained from research databases using software tools (Mukerjee etal., 2022). However, the analysis does not automatically and without expertise and knowledge of human researchers, lead to critical insights,

BUDHWAR et al. 45

unearthing reason behind interesting phenomena and evolution of theoretical contributions and such is the case with generative AI. Irrespective of the preliminary guidelines and policies provided by the publishers on the use of AI tools in research (for e.g., Elsevier, 2023), the proliferation of such tools will increase and ought to become more sophisticated. Therefore, future studies should identify the advantage and limitations of such tools, and how they can be used responsibly in academic research upholding the quality, contributions, impact and integrity of the work we publish.

Although AI systems are improving, a clear feature of present AI generated text is a certain blandness. It has few grammatical imperfections (although ChatGPT has clearly not read Fowler's Modern English Usage), but at the same time, it does not carry that whiff of life experience that infuses human writing styles. It certainly may be capable of summarizing a debate but does not yet seem capable of generating novel or counter-intuitive insights, or indeed of exercising moral judgements. In this vein, the meaning of ‘responsible HRM research’ should be debated and defined to evolve and adapt research methods and philosophies, in the age of machines becoming ghost writers.

A serious concern is AI's potential to generate fake quantitative or qualitative research results; understandably, there are likely to be much higher expectations for data transparency in the future, and indeed, greater documentation of the research process. AI detection software is rapidly advancing. This raises the question as to how journals might deploy this software in the future. In other words, what might be acceptable in helping automate the more mechanistic aspects of the research process, and when does falsification and crookery start? Again, this does hold a potentially career threatening risk for early academic adopters of AI. Any sharp practices that escape detection and enable publication now are likely to be exposed by more sophisticated AI detection software in the future; as with plagiarists, such individuals will be stalked by the risk of lustration for the remainder of their academic careers. Moreover, scholarly associations are currently devising guidelines around the usage of AI; such rules will inevitably lead to more restrictions than the present Wild West. Potential authors need to be very aware of this in the same manner as inhabitants of nineteenth century Tombstone, Arizona, might, with the wisdom of retrospect, have been well advised to take note of the prospective arrival in town of a group of lawmen (and, indeed, a certain dentist) more seriously.

It also does raise issues around academic careers; ambitious scholars typically advance their careers by constantly honing their critical thinking, analytical and writing skills. It could well be argued that such academic skills may become devalued. However, this does not take account of the worth of novel ideas that are founded in the human world, and indeed, the value of scholarly conversation. HRM is about people, and for all humanity's flaws, it is a general principle that members of a group have a better idea of their interests than outsiders, be the latter human or mechanical. There is also the Hawking principle to consider: ‘when more advanced life forms meet more primitive ones, it never ends well for the latter’.

# 7. CONCLUDING REMARKS

As with any new technology, AI may have open ended effects on HRM, the study of the same, and indeed, economy and society at large. Although it has clear potential to be beneficial, its full consequences are unknown. Indeed, the jury is out if genuine AI exists at the present time at all; however, even sophisticated sets of data compilation and problem-solving algorithms may pose great opportunities and risks. At HRMJ, we are seeking to promote greater understanding and debate around AI and its effects on the study and practice of HRM; the different thematic presentations in this HRMJ perspectives editorial do not provide a single set of definitive solutions or judgements, but rather a starting point on this journey of discovery.

# Abstract

Prognostics and health management (PHM) technology plays a critical role in industrial production and equipment maintenance by identifying and predicting possible equipment failures and damages, thereby allowing necessary maintenance measures to be taken to enhance equipment service life and reliability while reducing production costs and downtime. In recent years, PHM technology based on artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in the context of the industrial IoT and big data, and it is widely used in various industries, such as railway, energy, and aviation, for condition monitoring, fault prediction, and health management. The emergence of large-scale foundation models (LSF-Models) such as ChatGPT and DALLE-E marks the entry of AI into a new era of AI-2.0 from AI-1.0, where deep models have rapidly evolved from a research paradigm of single-modal, single-task, and limited-data to a multi-modal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model paradigm. ChatGPT represents a landmark achievement in this research paradigm, offering hope for general artificial intelligence due to its highly intelligent natural language understanding ability. However, the PHM field lacks a consensus on how to respond to this significant change in the AI field, and a systematic review and roadmap is required to elucidate future development directions. To fill this gap, this paper systematically expounds on the key components and latest developments of LSF-Models. Then, we systematically answered how to build the LSF-Model applicable to PHM tasks and outlined the challenges and future development roadmaps for this research paradigm.

# 1. Introduction

Prognostics and health management (PHM) is a crucial technology for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of industrial equipment [1, 2]. By monitoring and managing equipment comprehensively, PHM reduces the probability of equipment failure and minimizes production downtime, thereby improving equipment reliability and production efficiency and creating significant economic benefits for enterprises [3, 4]. In industrial production practice, PHM has three core tasks: fault detection (anomaly detection) [5-7], fault diagnosis [8-11], and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation [12-14]. Anomaly detection aims to timely identify abnormal activities and states of equipment, while fault diagnosis aims to determine the cause and location of equipment faults. RUL estimation, on the other hand, predicts the time when equipment may fail in the future. These three tasks work together from different perspectives to ensure the safe operation of equipment. As industrial equipment becomes more sophisticated and complex, and the volume of operational monitoring data grows, automation of industrial data analysis, equipment status monitoring, and health management is necessary [15]. This automation can significantly reduce the maintenance costs of industrial assets, improve the efficiency and accuracy of equipment status identification and fault prediction, and enhance the reliability and safety of equipment operation.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of PHM with the advancement of machine learning and deep learning [16-18] technologies, enabling automated industrial equipment condition monitoring and fault prediction, and greatly improving the intelligent level of industrial asset maintenance. Since the early 20th century, machine learning technology has played a crucial role in realizing intelligent identification and decision-making in PHM [19-21]. The PHM models based on machine learning mainly comprise two core components: feature engineering and machine learning models. Feature engineering leverages statistical analysis and signal analysis techniques [22-26] to extract health-related feature information from industrial monitoring data. Machine learning models use various prediction and identification models, such as support vector machines (SVM) [27-29] and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) [30-32], to achieve intelligent decision-making. This research paradigm has enabled PHM to achieve preliminary automation and reduced the demand for manual labor in industrial equipment maintenance. However, despite the progress made, manual feature engineering is still required, limiting the ability of PHM to cope with large-scale data. The limited learning capacity of machine learning models makes it difficult for this paradigm to adapt to the challenges posed by the big data era.

Since 2012, deep learning technology [33-35] has revolutionized the paradigm of various research fields with its powerful data analysis, feature extraction, and intelligent decision-making capabilities. Deep learning realizes automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition of complex data by establishing a multi-level neural network structure, which can automatically process high-dimensional, nonlinear, and large amounts of data, and has adaptive and generalization capabilities. Therefore, deep learning has become a mainstream tool in the PHM field [17, 18, 36], continuously improving the automation and intelligence of industrial asset maintenance. Various deep network models have been proposed for different PHM.

applications and tasks, such as autoencoders [37-39], convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [40-49], and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [50-52]. Autoencoders achieve unsupervised representation learning through data compression or reconstruction, performing well in tasks such as data noise reduction, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection [53]. CNNs, based on convolution theory, achieve efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction by weight sharing and hierarchical learning, making them suitable for health monitoring, fault prediction and diagnosis, and RUL prediction of industrial equipment [54]. RNNs excel at encoding long-distance timing features, making them ideal for analyzing and processing various timing signals [55]. Therefore, RNNs are widely used in various industrial PHM applications. Deep learning technology has significantly reduced the need for manual labor in industrial PHM applications by building an end-to-end intelligent decision-making model [8]. However, existing deep learning models still have limitations in multi-task, generalization, and cognitive abilities. Therefore, breaking through these limitations to realize a comprehensive multi-task intelligence model with high generalization and cognitive ability is an urgent problem that requires a solution.

Fig. 1. From AI-1.0 to AI-2.0, the research paradigm of deep learning has undergone tremendous changes. In the past two years, large-scale Foundation models (LSF-Models) [56, 57], such as GPT-3 [58, 59] and ChatGPT [60, 61], have demonstrated highly intelligent natural language understanding capabilities with fluent text dialogue. Large-scale multi-modal text and image understanding models, such as GPT-4 [62], DALL-E-2 [63], and segment anything model (SAM) [64], further demonstrate this research paradigm's extraordinary achievements in multi-modal dialogue, image generation and segmentation. The AI-based deep model has developed rapidly from a single-modal, single-task, limited-data research paradigm (AI-1.0) to a multi-modal, multi-task, massive data and super-large model research paradigm (AI-2.0). Fig. 1 clearly shows the difference between these two research paradigms. The core of AI-2.0 is the LSF-Model with cross-domain knowledge, which can understand the general notion of data and achieve Zero-shot.

Generalization on unseen data without additional training [64]. The realization of this model is mainly based on the following three key components, the potent feature extraction model [65-68], the unsupervised representation learning algorithm [69-71], and the multi-modal fusion algorithm [72, 73]. Moreover, extensive unlabeled or labeled multi-modal data is a prerequisite for this development. However, how to build the LSF-Model with cross-domain knowledge in the PHM field is still unknown, and there is still a lack of sufficient research and analysis on how to develop feature extraction, representation learning, and multi-modal fusion algorithms suitable for the PHM field. Moreover, how the PHM field responds to this enormous change in the AI field is still inconclusive, and there are lack of systematic literature review, as well as roadmaps for future research direction. In order to fill this gap, this paper first systematically presents the key components and cutting-edge progress of LSF-Models. Then, we systematically answer how to build effective LSF-Model suitable for the PHM field. We also elaborated on the challenges this research paradigm will face and the roadmaps for future development.

# 2. Key Components of Large-Scale Foundation Models

LSF-Models are a class of large-scale deep neural network models consisting of billions of parameters [57]. These models are trained on massive amounts of data to enable them to capture the complex relationships and general notions of the data, thus possessing cross-task and cross-domain zero-shot generalization capabilities. The development of LSF-Models has benefited from the advancement of various technologies, including the improvement of computing hardware, the availability of big data, the development of representation learning, the improvement of model architecture, and the advancement of multi-modal data fusion algorithms. The improvement of computing hardware and the availability of big data are the basic conditions for LSF-Models [74]. This is mainly due to the development of computing hardware and the Internet in recent years, which respectively provide the hardware foundation and data.
---
foundation for the realization of LSF-Models. Additionally, the development of algorithms and neural networks has played an inseparable role in the development of LSF-Models. For instance, the proposal of transformer architecture provides powerful feature extraction capabilities for the foundation model [66, 68]. Self-supervised learning has facilitated the development of a powerful unsupervised feature representation capability for the foundation model [69, 70]. Furthermore, multi-modal fusion algorithms have equipped the foundation model with the ability to interact across modalities [72]. In the subsequent section, we discuss and analyze these three aspects in detail.

# 2.1 Transformer-Based Feature Extraction

# 2.1.1 Network Architecture of Transformer

Transformer [75] is a powerful network model based on the self-attention mechanism, which was first used in applications such as sequence modeling and natural language processing (NLP) [76]. Fig. 2 shows the basic architecture of the Transformer, which is a typical encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder and decoder are composed of multiple transformer blocks. The encoder encodes the input sequence into a hidden vector representation, and the decoder synthesizes the contextual information of the hidden vector to generate sequence information. Each Transformer block contains a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), residual connections [77], and layer normalizations [78]. It is described in detail below.

Self-Attention Mechanism. Assuming that the input feature sequence of the self-attention mechanism is represented as, X is encoded into Q (query vector), K (key vector), and V (value vector) by three sets of linear transformation layers. The learnable weights of these three sets of linear transformation layers are denoted as, respectively. Based on the obtained Q, K, and V, the self-attention mechanism can be expressed as:
---
# 8

# (1)

where is to calculate the similarity between Q and K, and then input the scale-transformed similarity into Softmax to obtain the attention weight, and finally perform matrix multiplication between the weight and V to obtain the final output. In addition, d represents the dimensions of Q and K, and is a scale factor to avoid excessive feature values. The advantage of the self-attention mechanism is that it can consider the relationship between all positions in the sequence, not just the relationship between adjacent positions. This global relational modeling capability is essential for many NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text generation, and language understanding.

# Multi-Head Attention Mechanism

MHA is an extended form of self-attention mechanism, which can improve the model's ability to model different information. MHA encodes the input vector into multiple subspaces, calculates the self-attention mechanism in each subspace, and finally stitches the attention results of different subspaces to obtain the final attention result. This enables the model to encode global contextual features of input features from different perspectives. MHA can be expressed as:

# (2)

where X and S denote the input and output of the MHA, respectively; H represents the number of attention heads; means splicing the output results of H attention heads, and means an attention head, that is, a self-Attention mechanism module; in the MHA, there are H parallel attention heads. denotes the weight of a fully connected layer, which is used to fuse the output weights of multiple attention heads.

# Feed-Forward Neural Network

In the Transformer block, following the MHA is the FFNN, which consists of two linear transformation layers and a nonlinear activation function, which can be expressed as:

# (3)

where W1 and W2 are the parameters of the two linear transformation layers, respectively, and represents the nonlinear activation function, such as ReLU and GELU [79]. Its primary function is to enable more complex mapping and transformation of the output from the self-attention mechanism, thereby enhancing the processing of intricate features and semantic information.

# Layer Normalization and Residual Connection

Layer normalization is utilized to enable the network to adapt to input data of differing scales and distributions. Specifically, through the normalization of output from each neuron, a similar data distribution is achieved across each layer, thus facilitating network optimization and training. Residual connections are implemented to enhance the transfer of gradient information throughout the network. As such, residual connection and layer normalization are added following MHA, which can be expressed as:

# 2.1.2 Research Progress of Transformer

The groundbreaking architecture design of the Transformer enables it to obtain excellent feature extraction performance, thereby attracting scholars to improve and optimize its key components continuously. The attention mechanism is the core component of Transformer, and its main improvement directions are:

1. Sparse attention [80-82];
2. Linearized attention [83-86];
3. Optimizing the MHA mechanism [87-91];
4. Alternatives to the attention mechanism [92-94].

Sparse attention is dedicated to introducing sparsity bias into the attention mechanism. Li et al. [81] proposed the sparse adaptive connection method in the self-attention architecture, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention. Linearized attention is dedicated to optimizing the feature interaction of self-attention to achieve linear complexity. Katharopoulos et al. [86] formulated self-attention as a linear dot product of kernel feature maps and utilized the matrix product's associativity to reduce computational complexity. The optimization of MHA focuses on enabling different attention heads to capture different valuable features adequately. Li et al. [91] introduced disagreement regularization in Transformer to make different attention heads have diversity and obtain valuable information from different subspaces. Alternatives to the attention mechanism are dedicated to finding new schemes to achieve a faster and more efficient global information interaction mechanism. For example, Rao et al. [94] have substituted the self-attention layer with a global filter layer based on Fast Fourier transform to capture global information at the frequency domain level.

In addition, scholars have conducted a considerable amount of work on improving and optimizing the activation functions [95, 96] and FFNNs [97-99] of the Transformer. In addition to research on the core components within the Transformer, optimizing the overall architecture of the Transformer is also a research focus. For example, Wu et al. [100] proposed a lightweight Lite Transformer that can be deployed on edge computing devices to execute NLP applications. Rae et al. [101] proposed a new sequence model: Compressive Transformer, which compresses past memories for long-range sequence learning. Liu et al. [102] introduced the idea of hierarchical feature learning in the Transformer architecture to obtain richer representations.

With the proposal of Vision Transformer (ViT) [103], it has gradually been introduced into image processing [66], video analysis [104, 105], and other related fields, which have also demonstrated excellent performance in these fields. To this end, various Vision Transformer architectures have sprung up [66, 68]. For example, Liu et al. [106] proposed a novel layered Transformer architecture based on shifted windows, which can be widely adapted to various vision applications. Huang et al. [107] further adopted the spatial shuffle operation to achieve cross-Window feature interaction, thereby improving the representation ability of the Transformer architecture in vision applications. Hu et al. [108] proposed a U-Net-like Swin Transformer model for visual image segmentation applications. The Transformer model has developed into a super-large system, and a large amount of research work has emerged. Please refer to the review papers [66, 68, 109] for a detailed review and analysis.

# 2.2 Self-Supervised Learning-Based Feature Representation

Self-supervised learning [69-71] is a paradigm of unsupervised learning that discovers effective feature representations by producing supervisory signals from unlabeled data. Unlike conventional supervised learning, which demands abundant labeled data, self-supervised learning exploits the abundant information of unlabeled data, thus reducing the reliance on manually labeled data. Typically, self-supervised learning devises a pretext task to enable the model to acquire valuable representations during the pretext task's resolution. The flowchart of self-supervised learning is shown in Fig. 3. Self-supervised learning has many classical algorithms in the fields of computer vision (CV) and NLP, mainly including the following methods.

|Self-Supervised Pre-Training|Self-Supervised Pre-Training|Downstream Task|Downstream Task|
|---|---|
|Self-Supervised Learning Model|Pretext Task|Supervised Learning Model|Objective|
|Massive Operational Data (Unlabeled)|Massive Operational Data (Unlabeled)|Massive Operational Data (Unlabeled)|Massive Operational Data (Unlabeled)|

|Zero/Few-Shot Generalization|Zero/Few-Shot Generalization|Zero/Few-Shot Generalization|Zero/Few-Shot Generalization|

Fig. 3. Flowchart of the self-supervised learning algorithm, using the PHM application as an example.

# Masked Language Modeling (MLM)

The fundamental concept of this approach is to randomly mask specific words or characters in the input sequence and then prompt the model to predict the masked tokens [110, 111]. MLM is one of the most popular pre-training methods in the current NLP field. Many pre-trained models, including BERT [112] and RoBERTa [113], are designed based on the idea of MLM. In addition to MLM, there are also some related self-supervised learning methods, such as next-sentence prediction [114, 115] and back translation [116]. These techniques can aid in pre-training NLP applications to enhance the model's generalization ability and performance.

# Autoregressive Models

This method is often used for pre-training in the NLP field, which predicts the next word based on a given context [117, 118]. For example, GPT [117] is a typical autoregressive-based method, and in this way, GPT can learn rich context-related information. As such, it has achieved notable success in NLP applications. XLNet [118] introduces a generalized autoregressive pre-training technique, which surpasses the constraints of BERT and accomplishes better contextual dependency learning. Oord et al. [119] proposed contrastive predictive coding that achieves self-supervised feature representation by predicting the future in the latent space, utilizing probabilistic contrastive loss to capture valuable information.

# Autoencoders

Autoencoders are a classic representation learning algorithm, which consists of an encoder and a decoder [120-123]. The encoder maps the input data to a latent space, and the decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent space. These algorithms learn valuable feature representations from images by minimizing reconstruction errors. Lin et al. [120] proposed a Masked Autoencoder pre-training strategy that can handle both text and visual data, accomplishing multi-modal feature representation.
---
# 2.2 Contrastive Learning

Contrastive Learning. This method aims to map similar samples to spaces that are close to each other and map dissimilar samples to spaces that are far away [124-126]. This approach helps models learn the differences and variations between data, thereby improving the model's generalization ability and performance [127]. Generally, the Contrastive Learning approach consists of two phases: constructing contrast pairs and training the model. In the contrast pair construction phase, techniques, such as random data augmentation, are commonly utilized to generate similar and dissimilar sample pairs. In the subsequent model training phase, a contrastive loss function is typically employed to minimize the distance between similar sample pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar sample pairs. Contrastive learning can be applied in various domains, such as image [128, 129], audio [130, 131], natural language [132], etc. Specifically, within the domain of image processing, contrastive learning methods, such as SimCLR [128], SimCLRv2 [129], and MoCo [133], leverage CNNs and data augmentation techniques to learn the semantic features of images and enhance the performance of tasks like image classification and object detection.

# Image Augmentation-Based Self-Supervised Methods

These methods mainly include rotation prediction, image colorization, image jigsaw puzzle, image inpainting, and image super-resolution. These methods are pretext tasks constructed based on the intrinsic characteristics of image data. Rotation prediction [134, 135] involves rotating the input image and predicting the rotation angle, enabling the model to learn the rotational invariance of the image. Image colorization [136, 137] involves adding appropriate colors to the input grayscale image, thereby facilitating the learning of valuable contextual information and enhancing the model's understanding of the data. The primary objective of the Image Jigsaw Puzzle [138-140] is to cut the image into pieces and reassemble them, enabling the model to learn the relationships between different parts of the image and improving its ability to learn image features. The main objective of Image Inpainting [141, 142] is to mask or delete certain regions in the image, enabling the model to learn how to infer and fill in the missing parts, thereby improving its ability to learn image features. Image Super-Resolution [143, 144] aims to generate high-resolution data from low-resolution data, allowing the model to learn detailed image information more effectively.

Self-supervised learning has the advantage of leveraging the inherent characteristics of data to enable the model to learn general and high-quality data features and potential relationships from a vast amount of unlabeled data. This facilitates the model's better understanding of the nature and laws of the data, significantly reducing the cost of manually annotated data. This characteristic also makes self-supervised learning suitable for large-scale datasets, and as a result, plays a crucial role in the research of LSF-Models. Consequently, a significant amount of research work related to self-supervised learning has emerged, and for a comprehensive review and analysis, please refer to the review papers [69-71, 125].

# 2.3 Multi-Modal Data Fusion

Multi-modal fusion [145-147] is a technique for integrating information from various modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video, in order to enhance model performance and generalization. The aim of multi-modal fusion is to extract more comprehensive feature representations by exploiting complementary
---
information between multiple data sources, which in turn improves model performance in a wide range of applications, including sentiment analysis [148] and video question answering [149]. Furthermore, in the domain of LSF-Models, researchers strive to achieve interaction between multi-modal information and the comprehension of fundamental concepts, such as text-based image generation [63] and image captioning [150]. To date, multi-modal fusion approaches comprise the following methods.

# 3. Multi-modal Fusion Approaches

# Early Fusion

[151, 152]. This method integrates information from different modalities at the input layer to obtain a comprehensive multi-modal representation that is subsequently input into a deep neural network for training and prediction.

# Late Fusion

[153-155]. This method independently extracts and processes features from different modalities in their respective neural networks and fuses the features at the output layer to obtain the final prediction result.

# Attention Fusion

[156-159]. This method utilizes attention mechanisms to weigh and fuse information from different modalities, enhancing the weight of important information and obtaining a more accurate multimodal representation and prediction result.

# Heterogeneous Fusion

[160-163]. This method combines information from different modalities on a heterogeneous graph to consider the characteristics and interrelationships of different modalities, thereby obtaining a more accurate multi-modal representation and prediction result.

# Prompt-Based Methods

[164-167]. This method introduces natural language prompts (Prompts) into the model to enhance its performance. In multi-modal fusion tasks, Prompts can guide the model to generate accurate cross-modal prediction results.

In LSF-Models research, multi-modal data fusion algorithms usually require the following properties.

- Multi-source: Multi-modal data fusion algorithms can fuse data from multiple sources simultaneously.
- Multi-level: Multi-modal data can be fused at different feature levels, improving data processing and analysis accuracy and efficiency.
- Diversity: Multi-modal data fusion algorithms can process data from multiple modalities, such as images, voice, text, etc.

It can be seen that research on multi-modal fusion empowers models to comprehend various general concepts of the real world from multiple perspectives. Just as humans possess visual, auditory, tactile, and other sensory organs, general AI models will undoubtedly have strong multi-modal information perception abilities.

# 3. Progress on Large-Scale Foundation Models

In the preceding section, we deliberated on several key components that are imperative to construct LSF-Models. This section provides an extensive overview and discourse on the advancement of LSF-Models in the domains of NLP and CV, respectively, to exhibit the latest development trends and directions in these fields.

# 3.1 Large-Scale Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing
---
As a result of the progression of Internet technology, acquiring ultra-large-scale text data has become increasingly convenient, consequently enabling LSF-Models to attain remarkable advancements in the realm of NLP [168, 169]. Current large-scale language models can efficiently and accurately accomplish various NLP applications [170], such as language generation, language understanding, question-answering systems, machine translation, etc. Presently, a plethora of LSF-Models have surfaced in the NLP domain, and the principal models are delineated below.

# BERT Series Models

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [112] is a language model based on the pre-trained bidirectional Transformer architecture. BERT employs pre-training to acquire universal language representation from the voluminous unlabeled text. The pre-training tasks employed by BERT include MLM and Next Sentence Prediction. Subsequently, Liu et al. [113] enhanced BERT by proposing the RoBERTa model, which implemented optimization strategies such as prolonged training time, increased training data, dynamic masks, and finer-grained batch size. Furthermore, Lan et al. [171] developed a lightweight variant of BERT (ALBERT) through techniques such as parameter sharing and embedding decomposition, effectively reducing the resource consumption and training duration of the model.

# GPT Series Models

The GPT series is a collection of Transformer-based pre-trained language models developed by OpenAI, consisting of GPT1.0 [172], GPT 2.0 [173], GPT 3.0 [58], GPT 3.5 (ChatGPT) [60], and the most recent model, GPT-4 [62]. The model utilizes the autoregressive approach to perform unsupervised pre-training on a massive corpus, enabling the learning of high-level representations of text and vocabulary, which facilitates fine-tuning and transfer learning in various downstream tasks. The primary
---
characteristic of the GPT series model is the utilization of unlabeled text data for pre-training, combined with the self-attention mechanism and position encoding of the Transformer. Additionally, the adoption of the autoregressive model allows the model to process sequential information in text effectively. Fig. 4 shows the three training steps of GPT 3.5 and their details. GPT 3.5 has demonstrated potent natural language understanding capabilities, and the latest model, GPT-4, integrates image understanding capabilities, resulting in highly intelligent multi-modal information processing capabilities.

# 3.1 ERNIE Series Models

The ERNIE series are pre-trained language models based on the Transformer architecture developed by Baidu. The series includes ERNIE 1.0 [174], ERNIE 2.0 [175], and ERNIE 3.0 [176]. These models adopt the training method of the autoregressive language model and MLM and incorporate two new pre-training tasks, namely text cloze and sentence rearrangement, to enhance the model's contextual understanding and sentence-level semantics. ERNIE expands the model's corpus and knowledge base by designing a new knowledge distillation and data enhancement strategy. Moreover, ERNIE 2.0 and ERNIE 3.0 adopt a knowledge distillation approach to transfer knowledge from a teacher model to a smaller student model, which improves the model's efficiency and allows it to be deployed on devices with limited computational resources.

# 3.2 T5 Series Models

The T5 series is a general-purpose text generation framework developed by Google [177]. It adopts the Transformer structure. Its core idea is to unify various NLP tasks into text-to-text conversion problems, simplifying pre-training and fine-tuning. The T5 model uses the Encoder-Decoder structure, where the Encoder is responsible for encoding the input text, and the Decoder is responsible for decoding the output text. The latest improved version Plan-T5 [178], can be used for almost any NLP task by fine-tuning on ultra-large-scale tasks and initially realizes the one model for all tasks.

In addition, numerous companies and research institutions have developed a plethora of high-quality large-scale language models. For instance, Meta Corporation recently unveiled its LLaMA model [179], which boasts a massive parameter volume of 65 billion. Similarly, Huawei has proposed a trillion-parameter language model [180] that exhibits exceptional performance on various Chinese NLP tasks. Another noteworthy model, Sparrow [181], developed by DeepMind, aims to align the model's responses more closely with the user's intentions and provide more accurate replies based on the searched content. Currently, large-scale language models are continually being refined and optimized. Please refer to the review papers [182, 183] for a detailed review and analysis.

# 3.3 Large-Scale Foundation Models for Computer Vision

Inspired by the resounding success of large-scale language models in the NLP field, researchers have explored the application of LSF-Models in the CV field [64, 184, 185]. Similarly, visual foundation models involve representation learning on large-scale image datasets to achieve cross-domain and high-level semantic understanding while enabling multi-tasking capabilities. Since gathering and analyzing massive image data is more challenging than text data, most traditional computer vision pre-training models rely on well-established classification architectures, such as ResNet [77], to train on the ImageNet dataset [74].
---
pre-trained weights obtained from such models are then transferred to downstream tasks, improving performance on various visual tasks. However, despite ImageNet containing more than 14 million images, these conventional pre-trained models still fall short of possessing exceptional multi-task capabilities, few-shot generalization capabilities, and the ability to learn general image concepts. Recently, thanks to advancements in algorithms and the availability of vast amounts of image data, general-purpose large-scale visual models are being developed.

# Segment Anything Model (SAM)

In 2023, Meta AI released the first large-scale general-purpose visual image segmentation model: Segment Anything Model (SAM) [64, 184]. They also released the largest image segmentation dataset, which contains 11 million images and 1 billion masks. SAM stands out for its remarkable ability to perform both interactive and automatic segmentation as a single model. Additionally, it exhibits a profound understanding of general concepts present in image data, enabling it to generate masks for any object in any image or video, even those that it did not encounter during training. This zero-shot generalization capability eliminates the need for domain-specific data collection for fine-tuning the model.

# Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) [186] is a multi-modal pretraining model developed by OpenAI, which captures the joint representation of vision and language by simultaneously learning image and text information. CLIP employs contrastive learning as a training strategy to learn a joint representation of vision and language by comparing matching images and text (positive examples) with mismatched images and text (negative examples). Specifically, CLIP maximizes the similarity between matching images and text, while minimizing the similarity between unmatched images and text. The model was trained on a dataset of 400 million images and text collected from the Internet. It also enables zero-shot generalization to unseen data, enabling accurate image-to-text descriptions.

# DALL·E

DALL·E [185] is an image generation model based on Transformer and GAN proposed by OpenAI. The core of the DALL·E model is a dual-stream Transformer architecture, one of which is used to process text input, and the other is used to process image generation. It can automatically understand objects, scenes,
---
and situations described by natural human language and generate high-quality images. DALLꞏE 2 [63] is a further improved version, which can generate more realistic and high-resolution images.

Similarly, the vision-language representation learning model [187, 188], akin to the CLIP model [186], is undergoing rapid development intending to achieve cross-modal comprehension and interaction between images and natural language. At present, the mainstream models of this paradigm include ViT-BERT [189], BLIP [190], and ZERO [191], etc. These models are most designed based on the Transformer architecture, which obtains the cross-representation of vision and language through pre-training learning and performs fine-tuning in various tasks. These models have performed well in various applications of vision and language, laying a solid foundation for proper visual and language understanding.

# 4. Large-Scale Foundation Models for PHM

While deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in PHM, their effectiveness is limited because they are typically trained and optimized for specific domains and tasks. As a result, in complex and open industrial scenarios, deep learning models may exhibit several limitations, such as limited generalization, multi-tasking, and cognitive abilities. Existing models may perform well in known scenarios, but are challenging to generalize effectively to unknown scenarios [192-194]. This lack of zero-shot generalization ability makes it difficult to cope with the complexity of actual industrial scenarios. Furthermore, existing deep models usually focus on a single task. However, industrial equipment has hundreds of core components, all requiring health monitoring and fault prediction. It is unrealistic to develop a corresponding deep model for each core component. Finally, the existing deep models have limited cognitive ability, and it is difficult to understand the nature and general concepts of industrial data, so they often output incomprehensible and wrong results.

The study of LSF-Models shows us an efficient solution that can successfully solve the above problems. As described in Section 3, existing LSF-Models, such as ChatGPT [62] and SAM [64], have demonstrated excellent data understanding, zero-shot generalization, and strong multi-task capabilities. Moreover, it also has certain advanced cognitive abilities to solve some reasoning tasks. Therefore, the success of LSF-Models marks the transformation of the research paradigm in the AI field from a single-modal, single-task, and limited-data research paradigm (AI 1.0) to a multi-modal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model research paradigm (AI 2.0). However, how to develop LSF-Model in the field of PHM is still inconclusive. In order to promote the research and application of LSF-Model in the PHM field, this section explains and analyzes how to construct LSF-Models for PHM applications from four aspects.

# 4.1 Large-Scale Datasets for PHM
---
# 4.1.1 Research Status

Different from the NLP and CV fields, the data in the PHM field is generally high-frequency or low-frequency time-series data collected by various sensors, such as vibration signals [195], sound signals [196], current and voltage [197], temperature [198], pressure [199], etc. In addition, some applications try to use video and image data to achieve equipment health monitoring, such as track defect monitoring [200, 201], defective product identification [202, 203], and equipment crack monitoring [204, 205]. Currently, the PHM community has open-sourced dozens of datasets of different sizes and domains, such as bearing fault datasets [206], bearing degradation datasets [207], gearbox fault datasets [208], aircraft engine degradation datasets [209], three-phase motor fault datasets [210], industrial production monitoring datasets [211], wind turbine monitoring datasets [212], and so on. As the most classic fault diagnosis dataset, the CWRU bearing dataset [195] only contains limited working conditions and four different health categories, and each fault category contains only three fault degrees. The XJTU-SY bearing dataset, released by Wang et al. [207], contains only degradation data of 15 bearings from healthy to failure. The dataset published by Lessmeier et al. [213] includes vibration signal data from 32 bearings and current data from the drive motor. The wafer defect identification dataset released by Wang et al. [211] contains 38,000 wafer data samples, including 38 different types of mixed defect categories. Chao et al. [209] have open-sourced the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset, which contains eight sets of data with 128 units and has seven failure modes. It can be seen that the scale of these datasets is very small, and it is challenging to meet the needs of LSF-Models training and optimization. The deep models trained based on these datasets are difficult to understand the nature and laws of PHM data, and it is challenging to have multi-task and zero-shot generalization capabilities. Therefore, constructing a large-scale dataset in the PHM domain is the first step to realizing the LSF-Models.

The advent of Industrial Internet and Internet of Things (IoT) technology [214] has resulted in the installation of numerous sensors on contemporary industrial production equipment and various complex mechanical equipment to facilitate real-time monitoring of the system's various physical quantities for timely detection of anomalies. Therefore, most major enterprises have collected a large amount of industrial data and established corresponding data centers. As an example, China's urban rail trains, with decades of operational experience and accumulated actual operating data, generate massive and comprehensive datasets [215]. A single train can now monitor and record hundreds of variables related to its subsystems, components, and external environment in real-time, such as bearing oil temperature, gearbox noise, and the current and voltage of various systems. Similarly, a rail inspection car can obtain intensive parameters like rail gauge, level, and height over an extended distance. These massive data sets provide valuable information on the real-time status, degradation process, and interdependence of train subsystems and components. Collectively, they lay the groundwork for building the LSF-Model.

Despite the remarkable potential of these industrial data in constructing LSF-Models to solve various PHM tasks, there remains a need for further exploration. Industrial data may comprise a variety of sensor data, such as signals, images, and videos, as well as a significant amount of text information, including

# 4.1.2 Solution

Although LSF-Models have shown promising results in NLP and CV, the data in the PHM field differs significantly from that of the former two. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize and improve the key components of LSF-Models according to the unique data characteristics of the PHM field to achieve considerable performance in this domain. This requires exploring novel feature extraction models, self-supervised representation learning algorithms, and multimodal fusion algorithms tailored to the PHM domain. Additionally, in the industrial field, academia has established cutting-edge algorithm design and data analysis capabilities, while the industry has accumulated large-scale industrial monitoring data. Therefore, establishing the school-enterprise joint research center to fully leverage their respective advantages will effectively address existing challenges and significantly promote LSF-Model research in the PHM field.

In addition, the implementation of LSF-Models requires access to large-scale data. Ensuring data privacy protection while utilizing such data is another crucial issue that warrants attention. Unlike NLP and CV fields, where relevant data can be obtained on a large scale from the Internet, PHM datasets are in the hands of equipment operators, and they are often precious and may contain commercial secrets. Moreover, with the increasing focus on data privacy and security, regulatory bodies have introduced new laws to regulate the management and use of data [216]. Consequently, developing solutions that comply with strict privacy protection regulations and solve the challenges of data fragmentation and isolation is necessary. Federated learning [217, 218], a distributed machine learning framework with privacy protection and secure encryption, is a possible solution. It allows decentralized participants to collaborate on machine learning model training without disclosing private data to other participants. Currently, solutions for data privacy protection based on federated learning have been proposed in the PHM field [219-221].

Fig. 6 shows the multi-vehicle multi-center data privacy security protection architecture based on federated learning. However, most of the existing federated learning algorithms are yet to be deployed in real industrial large-scale data analysis. Therefore, promoting large-scale industrial data analysis and the establishment of LSF-Models requires collaborative efforts from both academia and industry.

# 4.2 Transformer for PHM

# 4.2.1 Research Status

The Transformer [75] is a deep learning model that is specialized in modeling long-distance feature correlations, allowing for the modeling of the correlation between any two positions in the signal, irrespective of the actual physical distance between the features. Its efficient long-term dependency modeling capability makes it well-suited for analyzing and processing various sensor data in the PHM field. Therefore, the Transformer has found widespread application in various PHM applications [42, 222-224], achieving impressive performance results. Jin et al. [224] proposed a time series-based Transformer model with superior fault recognition capability compared to traditional CNN and RNN models. Wang et al. [42] proposed a high-speed train wheel wear prediction model based on the Transformer, which leverages the strengths of both the Transformer and CNN to encode global and local information effectively. Fang et al. [222] optimized the Transformer model and proposed a lightweight fault diagnosis framework based on the Transformer, which achieves efficient and accurate fault diagnosis with reduced computational complexity.

Despite achieving significant success in the field of PHM, the Transformer model still has some limitations that need to be addressed. Firstly, the Transformer model is primarily designed for processing static input data, such as text, and although it can incorporate timing information through position coding, it does not directly consider timing information [225]. Therefore, it is difficult for Transformer to fully learn the continuous time relationship of data when processing industrial time series data. Secondly, the Transformer model may not perform well for noisy industrial data. In real-world industrial production processes, industrial data containing noise is commonplace, and the Transformer model may not be robust enough to handle such noisy data. Thirdly, as mentioned previously, industrial data often comprise multiple types of sensor data and a significant amount of textual information, posing a new challenge to the design of.
---
# 4.2.2 Solution

Due to its implementation based on the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer model faces challenges in considering the temporal relationship between time series data. The self-attention mechanism is restricted to consider only the relationship between positions in the sequence, lacking the ability to capture the relative time relationship on the time axis. To address this issue, several approaches can be adopted.

Firstly, a temporal encoding mechanism can be integrated into the Transformer model to facilitate the direct learning of temporal relationships. Secondly, an effective temporal attention mechanism can be explored to capture temporal dependencies between data within the Transformer architecture. Finally, Transformer-based time series models, such as time series Transformer [226], can be explored considering the characteristics of sensor data. These models need to be specifically designed to process time series data, integrate global time series information, and improve the modeling of time correlation.

Data collected in the industrial field often contains complex noise, unlike NLP and CV fields, where data is generally clean. As a result, most existing deep learning models are ill-equipped to handle the interference of noise or irrelevant information on time series signals. In traditional signal analysis, various methods have been proposed to remove signal noise and extract valuable information. These methods include time and frequency domain filtering [227, 228], Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [229, 230], wavelet transforms [231, 232], etc. Therefore, the deep integration of Transformer and signal analysis techniques can be a promising solution to this issue. For instance, Rao et al. [233] proposed an FFT-based global filtering layer to replace the Transformer's self-attention mechanism, which resulted in better performance. Similarly, Wang et al. [41] achieved the best performance in a noisy environment by fusing wavelet transform with deep learning models, and the proposed multi-layer wavelet model is shown in Fig. 7. However, how to endow the Transformer with more advanced and effective signal analysis capabilities remains to be further studied.

Finally, to simultaneously process multi-sensor data and industrial text data, it is essential to redesign the Transformer architecture and create the multi-modal Transformers [234-236]. The main idea of the multi-modal Transformer is to embed different types of data (such as text, image, and audio) into the Transformer model, thereby enabling end-to-end modeling when dealing with multi-modal data. Several solutions are feasible, including transformer-based multi-modal embedding, transformer-based cross-modal pre-training, and Transformer-based multi-modal attention. Multi-modal embedding encodes and embeds various sensor data into the Transformer architecture to represent multi-sensor data simultaneously. Cross-modal pre-training utilizes various sensor data to pre-train Transformer to learn valuable information from different data types, and then applies it to downstream multi-sensor data processing. Multi-modal attention is a common solution that achieves the adaptive fusion of multi-sensor information by utilizing attention weights.

# 4.3 Self-Supervised Learning for PHM

# 4.3.1 Research Status

As previously mentioned, a significant amount of sensor monitoring data is gathered during industrial production and equipment operation. However, academia and industry struggle to fully utilize this vast amount of operational data to build PHM models. The primary challenges are the unavailability of labeled data, the presence of noise, and the large data volume. As a result, it is difficult for existing deep models to effectively extract useful information from such data. Self-supervised learning [70, 124], which can automatically learn valuable feature representations from a large amount of unlabeled data, has emerged as a core algorithm for building PHM foundation models. Currently, self-supervised learning has been researched and applied in the field of PHM [237-241]. For example, Zhang et al. [239] developed a self-supervised algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge and has demonstrated good fault identification capabilities on small labeled datasets. Wang et al. [49] proposed a novel pretext task for self-supervised representation training, which has effectively extracted valuable information from unlabeled signals. Meanwhile, Ding et al. [237] developed a pre-training algorithm based on contrastive learning, which has shown promise in identifying early failures of bearings.

Although self-supervised learning has shown great potential in the field of PHM, it requires the design of effective pretext tasks to learn useful feature representations. Current pretext tasks may not capture fault- and health-related information adequately, particularly in complex industrial systems. Furthermore, self-supervised learning models may be sensitive to noise, which could impact the learned feature representation in the case of poor data quality, thereby reducing the performance of fault diagnosis.
---
# 4.3.2 Solution

The fundamental aim of researching LSF-Models is to attain few-shot or zero-shot generalization. Therefore, the primary question that needs to be solved when designing models and algorithms is: What kind of models and algorithms can achieve zero-shot generalization [64]? Autoencoder-like architectures [53], specifically those pertaining to signal reconstruction, signal completion, signal denoising, etc., constitute an effective solution. However, their feature representation process lacks a direct correlation with health information. Hence, while developing pretext tasks, it is essential to ensure maximum relevance with equipment health.

In the domain of PHM, the frequency domain is a more effective method for reflecting the fault and health status information of equipment than the time domain. Moreover, analysis from the frequency domain level better tackles noise interference and enhances model noise robustness. Thus, it is imperative to comprehensively consider signal frequency domain information while constructing self-supervised learning pretext tasks. There exist several potential solutions for this:

1. Utilize both time-domain and frequency-domain features concurrently in self-supervised learning algorithms, which can be fused into a unified feature representation. This involves using the original time-domain data and its corresponding frequency-domain data as input to train a multimodal self-supervised learning model to learn time-domain and frequency-domain features.
2. Develop a deep frequency space learning model, such as wavelet-based CNN [41, 46, 47], which can directly learn frequency features and capture frequency information in the data.
3. Construct pretext tasks that rely on the frequency domain data of the signal, such as reconstructing frequency domain information.
4. Create contrastive learning algorithms based on time-frequency consistency [242] of signals for effective self-supervised training on time-series data.
5. The correlation of multi-sensor data can be used to construct pretext tasks. For instance, a part of sensor data can be used to predict the value of other sensor data, to induce the model to learn the direct interdependence of multi-sensors and facilitate the feature representation learning of industrial multi-sensor data.

Finally, different self-supervised learning algorithms can represent different feature information of the data. Combining multiple self-supervised learning algorithms can help the model learn a more diverse set of feature representations, improving performance in downstream tasks. Therefore, using various algorithms to comprehensively pre-train the model in practice is an excellent solution.

# 4.4 Multi-Modal Fusion for PHM
---
# 4.4.1 Research Status

In the PHM field, the primary data source is discrete time-series data obtained from various sensors, including vibration signals, current and voltage, temperature, and pressure. Furthermore, certain applications attempt to utilize video and image data for the purpose of equipment health monitoring, such as track defect monitoring, defective product identification, and equipment crack monitoring. Data within the industrial domain may encompass numerous sensor data types (e.g., signals, images, videos, etc.) and a substantial amount of textual information (e.g., maintenance work orders, maintenance reports, etc.). Therefore, compared to the fields of NLP and CV, the PHM field places greater emphasis on information fusion of multi-sensor data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of equipment health status. Currently, several works have explored the fusion of multi-sensor information [243-248]. For example, Yang et al. [243] presented a multi-sensor and multi-scale fusion model based on the kurtosis weighting algorithm and pyramid principle, which demonstrated strong performance in bearing health identification. Long et al. [245] employed the Hilbert transform and FFT to extract valuable frequency information from multi-sensor signals and then developed an attention-based model for fault identification. Kumar et al. [248] simultaneously considered vibration and sound signals, utilizing wavelet transform as a feature extractor, and subsequently applied machine learning methods for fault diagnosis.

However, most existing datasets only contain data from one to three sensors, which is far from meeting the needs of practical industrial applications. Moreover, as the number of sensors increases, the data generated by different sensors may have different distributions, scales, and signal-to-noise ratios. Appropriate preprocessing methods and fusion strategies are crucial to the performance of PHM models. In addition, in the industrial field, multimodal fusion algorithms must consider the fusion of various industrial sensor information (such as signals, images, text, etc.). Nevertheless, existing research lacks sufficient solutions and optimization strategies for this challenge.

# 4.4.2 Solution

Effective multi-sensor data fusion in PHM requires comprehensive efforts in data fusion, feature fusion, and model fusion. The following solutions can enhance the multi-sensor fusion ability of models:

1. Explore new methods to integrate data from multiple sensors or sources into a unified data representation that considers the unique characteristics of each sensor. Such a data fusion approach can improve model performance and stability when dealing with data of different modalities.
2. Construct appropriate attention mechanisms for specific tasks and data characteristics to achieve efficient multi-sensor correlation modeling and fuse valuable features from sensors. This mechanism enables models to capture the correlation among sensors and highlight relevant features.
3. Optimize the structure and parameters of models to better adapt to the characteristics of different sensor data. Moreover, for different sensor data, building distinct models and then employ model fusion algorithms to establish connections among these models and achieve multi-sensor information fusion.
---
By tailoring models to the specific characteristics of different sensors, performance can be improved, and more accurate predictions can be made.

4) The graph neural network (GNN)-based multimodal fusion algorithm [249-251] can be studied to model complex relationships among multimodal data. This method uses GNN to construct the graph structure of multimodal data and takes the information of different sensors or data types as node input to realize the fusion of multimodal data. Finally, the solutions given above are all general solutions, which need to fully combine feature extraction models and self-supervised algorithms for specific data and applications to achieve the optimal performance of multimodal data fusion.

# 5. Challenges and Future Roadmaps

In the previous section, we discussed the technical details and feasible solutions for building LSF-Models in the PHM domain. This section attempts to discuss the challenges, roadmaps, and prospects of these models from a broader, more global perspective. By doing so, we can better understand the bigger picture and identify areas for improvement and future research in the field of PHM.

# 5.1 Challenges of Large-Scale Foundation Models in PHM

Fig. 8 shows the challenges faced by LSF-Models in the field of PHM, which mainly include seven aspects of datasets, security, credibility, transferability, advanced cognition, interpretability, and edge device deployment. They are described in detail below.

# 5.1.1 Large-Scale Dataset

Enterprises are reluctant to reveal their commercially sensitive information, including performance parameters of vital equipment, maintenance records, and production process failures, to their competitors. This information can be exploited by competitors to enhance competitiveness or damage the corporate reputation. Industrial production data and mechanical equipment operation monitoring data used for PHM applications will inevitably involve this commercially sensitive information. Consequently, enterprises have established rigorous data protection measures, resulting in a severe scarcity of large-scale publicly accessible industrial data in the PHM domain. Moreover, modern industrial equipment often functions in intricate and unbounded settings, leading to the collection of data that is frequently fraught with noise, missing data, distortion, abnormal disturbance, and other issues. Additionally, the diverse array of industrial sensors deployed results in the acquisition of varied data types, necessitating the processing of dissimilar modal data. As a result, the construction of effective large-scale PHM models using such data is challenging.

# Large-Scale Foundation Models in PHM

# Different Tasks

# Adversarial Attack

# Different Applications

Fig. 8. Challenges faced by LSF-Models in the field of PHM.

# 5.1.2 Security

Even though the LSF-Models have been trained on massive data sets, they remain vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial attacks [252]. Adversarial attacks can interfere with the output of PHM models through well-designed noises, causing the models to produce wrong results. This is unacceptable in critical PHM applications, such as the safety monitoring of nuclear power plants. In addition to direct attack, unintentional bias or errors may be introduced during the training process on large-scale data, which may cause the model to output biased and even wrong results. In this case, the PHM model may have security risks and be challenging to troubleshoot, because specific biases and erroneous results only occasionally occur in specific scenarios. In addition, since LSF-Models require massive computing resources for training and inference, they are also vulnerable to attacks targeting computing resources, such as DDoS attacks [253, 254] and malware attacks [255, 256].
---
# 5.1.3 Credibility

The credibility [257] of the LSF-Model represents the user's confidence in the accuracy and consistency of its output. Additionally, the model must withstand disturbances such as bias, noise, and input data perturbations while maintaining prediction accuracy and stability. Currently, the credibility of LSF-Model has significantly improved compared to traditional deep learning models. However, in the PHM domain, complex working conditions, diverse background noises, and varied old equipment lead to considerable data distribution disparities. Consequently, enhancing LSF-Model credibility remains a significant challenge.

# 5.1.4 Transferability

The transferability of the LSF-Model refers to whether the model can be well-migrated and adapted to different tasks and datasets. In the PHM domain, different tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, fault prediction, RUL estimation) are required for different scenarios. However, the nature and implementation of these PHM tasks are quite different, and how to achieve considerable transferability and adaptability across various tasks is a challenge. In addition, different mechanical equipment has different properties; for example, bearings, gearboxes, and crankshafts are all core rotating equipment, but their failure characteristics and properties vary greatly. Another challenge is how to deal with these differences to make LSF-Models have strong transferability and adaptability under various applications.

# 5.1.5 Advanced Cognition

Current research on large-scale language and visual models has demonstrated that LSF-Models possess advanced cognitive abilities and can learn general concepts to some extent [62], [64]. However, it remains unclear how these models acquire these abilities and how they can be explicitly enhanced. Moreover, PHM data exhibit significant randomness, posing a challenge for models to generalize high-level cognition from this data. In contrast to text and visual data, which possess regularity, time series data's diversity makes it harder for the model to extract generalized feature representations.

# 5.1.6 Interpretability

Interpretability [258-261] means that the decisions and outputs of the model can be interpreted and understood, and transparency means that the internal structure and operation of the model can be understood and reviewed by humans. However, with the development of LSF-Models, the inner workings and operating mechanisms of these models become more challenging to explain and understand, and the transparency becomes less and less. Additionally, LSF-Models may capture unpredictable data relationships and noise during training, which could lead to significant security risks. In the field of PHM [41], [262], [263], interpretability and transparency are of significant importance since models lacking transparency are challenging to trust in domains such as nuclear energy and aerospace. However, the complexity of LSF-Models makes studying their interpretability and transparency extremely difficult.
---
# 5.1.7 Edge Device Deployment

LSF-Models have massive parameters and complex structures, necessitating significant computing resources for training and inference. However, in the PHM field, it is often necessary to deploy monitoring models to edge computing devices or mobile terminals to meet real-time and security requirements. However, as existing edge computing devices generally lack the capability to execute LSF-Models, it poses a significant challenge to implement the deployment of such models without compromising their performance. Therefore, it is imperative to devise novel techniques to address this issue and facilitate the deployment of LSF-Models on edge computing devices [264-266] while preserving their performance.

# 5.2 Roadmaps of Large-Scale Foundation Models in PHM

Fig. 9 shows the future roadmaps of LSF-Models in the field of PHM. According to the challenges faced by LSF-Models, this section explores how to solve these challenges and elaborates on the roadmap for the future. They are described in detail below.

# 5.2.1 Roadmaps for Large-Scale Datasets

The core solution to constructing large-scale datasets in the PHM field is to eliminate the concerns of enterprises about data privacy and security, especially to enable all enterprises to obtain benefits, so as to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. To this end, the analysis and utilization of large-scale datasets in the PHM field can be advanced through the following approaches.

1. Construction of International and Domestic Standards. First, under the joint promotion of academia and industry, build a complete set of the standard system, including data collection and storage standards, etc. Then, use these standards to standardize the industry's data collection methods, data collection objects, data collection frequency, data collection quality, data storage format, and data privacy protection requirements.
2. Build Industrial Data Alliances to Realize Data Sharing. Under the promotion of the government or industry associations, establish an industrial data alliance to realize industry data sharing while protecting the business secrets of each enterprise and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. Models built using large-scale industry data can feed back participating companies to improve their products' quality, reliability, and safety.
3. Promote the Construction of School-Enterprise Joint Research Centers. In the industrial field, the academia has mastered cutting-edge algorithm design and data analysis capabilities, and the industry has mastered large-scale industrial data. Therefore, establishing school-enterprise joint research centers can synergistically leverage their respective strengths, facilitating the advancement of research on LSF-Models in the PHM field.
4. Explore Algorithms with Data Privacy Protection. Efficient cross-data center large-scale deep learning model training and optimization algorithms should be explored while protecting data privacy. To address concerns over data privacy and security among enterprises, techniques such as data desensitization, encryption, and other means can be employed to facilitate data sharing.

# 5.2.2 Roadmaps for Security

The security of LSF-Models can be mainly divided into data security, model security, and system security. To this end, the security of LSF-Model can be improved from the following aspects.

1. Ensure Data Security. Ensuring data security requires avoiding malicious tampering or contamination of the data and avoiding introducing bias or wrong information to the model. Therefore, ensuring that the model's training data source is reliable, high-quality, sufficient, and representative is necessary. In addition, a data security protection mechanism needs to be established to avoid malicious data leakage and tampering.
2. Ensure Model Security. Explore practical adversarial training and regularization methods [267-269] for LSF-Models to improve the model's ability to resist malicious disturbances and noise. In addition, enhance the security and privacy of the model, such as model encryption [270-272], to prevent the model from being stolen or reversed.
---
# 3) Ensure System Security.

For the LSF-Model-based PHM system, establish a monitoring system to detect abnormal operations and attack behaviors in time and record operation and audit logs simultaneously to investigate and trace security incidents.

# 5.2.3 Roadmaps for Credibility

Improving the credibility of LSF-Models is a comprehensive and complex issue, which can be optimized and improved from the following aspects.

1. Improve the Quality of Data. Data quality forms the basis for model training, and ensuring data quality is essential for enhancing the model's credibility. Therefore, a series of measures need to be taken to ensure data quality, including data cleaning, removing outliers, data enhancement, etc.
2. Improve the Robustness of the Model. Explore new solutions to improve the robustness and anti-interference ability of the model, such as improving the performance of the model in noisy [9, 10, 273-276], distribution shift [277-281] and out-of-distribution scenarios [282-284].
3. Improve the Comprehensiveness of Model Evaluation. The comprehensiveness and fairness of evaluation are crucial in improving the model's credibility. To achieve this, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate models using multiple evaluation indicators and multiple datasets while avoiding problems such as model bias for specific scenarios.
4. Guarantee Model Traceability. In order to improve the credibility of the model, it is necessary to fully record and trace the development, training, testing, deployment, and other processes of the model. This can ensure that the process of the model is controllable and the results can be verified, thereby improving the credibility of the model.

# 5.2.4 Roadmaps for Transferability

The objective of conducting LSF-Models is to advance the concept of a universal model capable of performing all tasks. With this aim in mind, we are dedicated to creating a comprehensive multi-task PHM system. To achieve this goal, it is the top priority to improve the portability and adaptability of foundation models as much as possible. The PHM field encompasses a diverse range of downstream tasks, and its application objects are complex, thus necessitating the exploration of new architecture design approaches, feature learning methods, and training algorithms for real-world industrial scenarios to enhance transferability.

1. Explore Flexible Model Architecture Design. To construct a general-purpose foundation model, it is necessary to investigate flexible model architecture designs that can be customized for different types of PHM applications, such as monitoring, diagnosis, prediction, and others.
2. Explore General Feature Representation Methods. Extracting valuable features from different data types is the key to realizing general models. These feature representation algorithms need to be able to capture various types of failure modes and also need to be robust to different types of failure data.
3. Explore Training Algorithms that are Suitable for PHM Applications. Although a large number of self-supervised training algorithms [49, 69-71, 124, 125] have been proposed in the fields of NLP and

# 5.2.5 Roadmaps for Advanced Cognition

LSF-Models have the potential to acquire advanced cognition and learn general concepts from data using vast amounts of training data and well-designed algorithms. In the field of PHM, LSF-Models with advanced cognitive capabilities can well understand the nature and general concepts of industrial data. As a result, LSF-Models can promptly adapt to varying industrial scenarios and tasks, effectively avoiding the generation of unintelligible outputs. However, the advanced cognitive capabilities displayed by current LSF-Models are inadequate. In addition to scaling up the amount of training data, the following aspects require exploration:

1. Explore the Data Requirements to Enable Advanced Cognitive Capabilities. Although some existing LSF-Models have demonstrated limited advanced cognitive abilities, what kind of data and how much data is needed to achieve such abilities is unknown. In addition, how to make full use of data information to obtain considerable cognitive ability on relatively small data sets is also a topic worthy of research.
2. Explore Model Requirements for Achieving Advanced Cognitive Capabilities. Most existing LSF-Models adopt Transformer architecture, but it has limitations. Hence, exploring new Transformer architectures or designing novel model architectures to enable LSF-Models to exhibit better cognitive capabilities are areas that warrant exploration.
3. Explore the Theoretical Requirements for Achieving Advanced Cognitive Capabilities. The realization of advanced cognitive abilities cannot rely solely on a considerable amount of experimental analysis; it also requires appropriate theories to provide guiding solutions. Therefore, exploring the reasons and mechanisms behind the acquisition of advanced cognitive abilities by LSF-Models will significantly advance the field.

# 5.2.6 Roadmaps for Interpretability

Deep learning has been criticized for its lack of interpretability and transparency, and this deficiency is more evident in LSF-Models. Improving the interpretability and transparency of these models would enhance their credibility, controllability, and reliability, making them more suitable for application in critical industrial fields such as aerospace and nuclear energy. Future research can be explored from the following three aspects to address this issue.

1. Explore Deep Interpretable Models. In the field of PHM, a feasible solution is to realize a deep model with high interpretability by means of the theoretical basis of signal analysis methods [41, 46, 47, 263]. Moreover, incorporating prior knowledge or physical background information into the model can also enhance its interpretability significantly.
2. Explore Methods for Analyzing Model Interpretability. According to the characteristics of deep models, practical methods for analyzing model interpretability need to be explored. For example, by

Despite the impressive performance of LSF-Models, their computational demands significantly limit their applicability. In order to promote the application of LSF-Models in the field of PHM, the following aspects can be explored to make them lightweight.

1. Explore Lightweight Deep Models. By exploring the design method of the lightweight deep model [291, 292] and developing new low-complexity algorithms and operator design paradigms, the computational load and resource usage of the model can be reduced.
2. Model Compression and Pruning. Model compression [293, 294] and pruning [295, 296] techniques can be explored to reduce the model's size. Efficient compression methods such as weight sharing, low-rank decomposition, and knowledge distillation can be employed. Additionally, redundant neurons or connections can be eliminated using efficient pruning methods.
3. Optimization of Network Topology. Explore new network topology design schemes, such as brain-inspired spiking neural networks [297, 298], to achieve deep network models with low power consumption and computational requirements.

# 5.3 Prospect: Universal PHM Platform

Traditional AI-based models for PHM typically require the development of unique data processing and model optimization algorithms for each subtask to achieve good performance in specific scenarios. For example, it is necessary to build independent fault diagnosis and RUL estimation models for bearings. However, complex industrial equipment may contain hundreds of core components, and it is a vast project to build corresponding PHM models for all components. In addition, this application paradigm cannot fully utilize the multimodal interrelated data of industrial equipment and cannot comprehensively characterize the health status of industrial equipment. Moreover, the various subtask models constructed are time-consuming and laborious and cannot guarantee that the model has good generalization. As mentioned earlier, the fields of NLP and CV, such as ChatGPT [62] and SAM [64], have demonstrated the fantastic performance of LSF-Models in cross-modal multi-task scenarios, and they have realized the idea of a model for all tasks to a certain extent. Therefore, inspired by this, it becomes possible to implement universal PHM platforms to

realize one model for all PHM tasks. This research concept will completely revolutionize the research paradigm in the PHM field, and the realization of universal PHM platforms will significantly promote the comprehensive intelligence of the PHM field.

# 6. Conclusions

At present, the research of deep learning is undergoing a new revolution, that is, the research paradigm (AI 1.0) of single mode, single task, and limited data is developing rapidly to the research paradigm (AI 2.0) of multimodal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model. AI 2.0 focuses on developing LSF-Models with cross-domain knowledge, which can show strong generalization and multi-task ability after training on massive datasets. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the three major technical

points of LSF-Models and analyzes the research status of LSF-Models in NLP and CV. The literature review shows a severe lack of research on LSF-Models in the PHM field, and there is no feasible solution for how to build LSF-Models for PHM applications. Therefore, this paper comprehensively answers how to build the LSF-Models suitable for the PHM field from four aspects: dataset, deep model, learning algorithm, and data fusion. Finally, this paper attempts to discuss the challenges and roadmaps of LSF-Models from a broader, more global perspective. Overall, this survey systematically introduces LSF-Models and their research status, challenges, solutions, roadmaps, and prospects in the PHM field, which is expected to provide valuable guidance for future research in this field.

# ABSTRACT

What does it mean for a generative AI model to be explainable? The emergent discipline of explainable AI (XAI) has made great strides in helping people understand discriminative models. Less attention has been paid to generative models that produce artifacts, rather than decisions, as output. Meanwhile, generative AI (GenAI) technologies are maturing and being applied to application domains such as software engineering. Using scenario-based design and question-driven XAI design approaches, we explore users’ explainability needs for GenAI in three software engineering use cases: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. We conducted 9 workshops with 43 software engineers in which real examples from state-of-the-art generative AI models were used to elicit users’ explainability needs. Drawing from prior work, we also propose 4 types of XAI features for GenAI for code and gathered additional design ideas from participants. Our work explores explainability needs for GenAI for code and demonstrates how human-centered approaches can drive the technical development of XAI in novel domains.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Generative AI (GenAI) is a class of machine learning (ML) algorithms that can learn from content such as text, images, and audio in order to generate new content. In contrast to discriminative ML algorithms, which learn decision boundaries, GenAI models produce artifacts as output, which can have a wide range of variety and complexity. One major recent development of GenAI is the introduction of OpenAI’s GPT-3 [13] model, which can generate human-like language output and has striking versatility. Other generative language models have emerged that focus on specific domains such as software engineering, implementing use cases of auto-completing code [15, 39], translating code from one programming language to another [88], and converting natural language to code [23]. The industry has begun to use these models to support software engineering practices, with the most prominent example being GitHub CoPilot [27], a GenAI-based co-programming tool.

As a novel technology applied to novel domains, there are many open questions to be answered for how to make GenAI more capable and user-friendly. One open question is how to enable explainability—allowing users to understand and have a better mental model—of GenAI. Recent works by Goodfellow et al. [28] and Ross et al. [86] have explored developing more interpretable GenAI models that follow more human-understandable processes. However, a more comprehensive view of explainability for GenAI is lacking: what do users need to understand about a GenAI model in order to

# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

# Jiao Sun et al.

effectively achieve their goals when working with it? In this paper, we build a foundational understanding of explainability needs for GenAI in the context of generative code models. This question of what do users need to understand about AI systems is core to the nascent field of Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) [21, 22, 52], which is a subset of the fields of human centered AI and human centered data science [6, 7, 25, 41, 65–67]. Our work is informed by a few key lessons from recent work in HCXAI, mostly conducted in the context of discriminative ML (e.g., for decision-support systems). First, explainability needs should be considered broadly as any means of helping users achieve a better understanding of the AI system. Liao et al. [48] proposed to define user’s explainability needs by what questions they ask to understand the AI [48] and developed a framework of common questions. This framework demonstrates that users are interested in a broad range of explanatory information about an AI model, including its overall logic, how it reasons to produce a particular output, the training data, and its performance and range of output. However, user needs regarding generative models were not explored in that work.

Second, XAI solutions that address explainability needs should not be limited to algorithmic explanations or showing model internals. Depending on user needs, it may be more critical to provide transparent information about a model’s capabilities, limitations (e.g. uncertainty [10]) or provenance [8]. Moreover, users may need additional information beyond algorithmic explanations to fill in gaps of understanding. For example, Ehsan et al. [19] proposed that social transparency – making visible the socio-organizational factors that govern the use of AI – can help users form a socially-situated understanding of an AI system and take more effective actions with it.

Finally, perhaps the most important lesson from HCXAI is that users’ explainability needs emerge in a usage context, guided by their goals and shaped by their backgrounds, expectations, as well as socio, organizational and cultural contexts [20, 48, 52]. It is thus necessary to follow a user-centered approach to understand explainability needs by involving target users and leveraging HCI methods that allow inquiry within the context of usage.

Based on these lessons, we adopted a scenario-based design method by constructing realistic usage scenarios for three use cases of GenAI for code: code translation, code auto-completion, and natural language to code. We invited 43 software engineers to participate in 9 workshops to elicit their explainability needs and design ideas around these scenarios. We adapted the question-driven method of Liao et al. [48, 50] to elicit and comprehensively explore participants’ explainability needs by what kind questions they would ask in the scenarios. We also gathered feedback and design ideas from participants for four kinds of XAI features that we propose for the uses cases of GenAI for code. Our work makes three main contributions to the IUI community:

1. We identify 11 categories of explainability needs in the context of Generative AI (GenAI) for code, for which we provide definitions and examples. We further contrast these categories with previous XAI techniques for discriminative ML and discuss explainability needs unique to GenAI and code generation use cases. We believe we are among the first to explore users’ explainability needs in an application domain of GenAI.
2. We propose four kinds of XAI features to support users of GenAI for code, based on prior work and adapted to the domain of code generation. These features are: AI documentation, indications of model uncertainty, visualizations of model attention, and social transparency. Based on participants’ responses, we provide concrete design recommendations to operationalize these features.
3. Our work makes methodological contributions by combining scenario-based design, participatory design workshops, and a question-driven approach to elicit explainability needs. We also reflect on the values and limitations of this method to inform future work that explores GenAI in new domains.

# 2 RELATED WORK

We review three areas of related work that shaped our study: GenAI for code, explainable AI, and human-centered approaches to AI.

# 2.1 Generative AI for Code

The application of modern NLP techniques to programming language can be traced back to the naturalness hypothesis [4, 17, 37], that software is a form of human communication. This hypothesis opened the door for applying NLP techniques previously used on human natural languages to source code, and recent work in this space is summarized by Talamadupula [92] and Allamanis et al. [4]. One example is how existing work on automatic, machine translation between human natural languages [71, 72] was applied to code. Specifically, the TransCoder [88] system applied neural machine translation techniques to translate source code across different languages. Other GenAI models have been developed that implement other use cases, such as generating documentation for code [23], auto-completing code [15, 39], generating unit tests [93], and finding duplicate code [30]. Models trained on massive code data sets are even able to handle multiple use cases at the same time, such as PLBART [3], CodeBERT [23], GraphCodeBERT [30]. Most recently, OpenAI released Codex [15], which is a GPT-based model trained on code from GitHub and powers their CoPilot [27] product. This model is capable of auto-completing code for various programming languages (e.g., Python, TypeScript, Go, Ruby), as well as generating code from natural language. The release of Copilot is seen as a revolution of AI-assisted software programming and has attracted much attention since its release [63]. Despite the fact that GenAI for code models still have room for improvement in the quality of their outputs – e.g., TransCoder only produces a correct translation 30%-70% of the time depending on the source and target language [88] – recent work by Weisz et al. [100] suggests that software engineers may nonetheless be tolerant of using such models in their work. Given the emerging productization of GenAI for code models, we believe it is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of questions software engineers will have when working with such models to guide technical XAI work and design solutions to answer them.

# 2.2 Explainable AI

Explainable AI (XAI) has spurred great academic, industry, and public interests in the past few years, thanks to the popularity of inscrutable “opaque-box” ML models. Many XAI techniques have

# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design

# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

been developed for discriminative ML models, both through pro-

ducing directly interpretable models [14, 44] and generating post-

hoc explanations for a trained opaque-box model [47, 62, 80, 104]. These explanations take a variety of forms. For example, global explanations provide an overview of the model logic, while local ex-

planations elucidate the rationale behind a particular output. A full review of XAI techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and can

be found in many recent survey papers [1, 29, 55, 56]. Our work is most closely informed by, and intends to bridge, the emerging topic of explainability for generative models, and the inter-disciplinary field of Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) [21, 22, 52].

Compared to discriminative models, much less attention has been paid to developing XAI techniques for generative AI models. Some explored ways to make generative models more directly in-

terpretable, which is often framed as making the representation learning of a GenAI model in its latent dimensions semantically meaningful so people can directly examine the model internals [28]. For example, disentanglement is a technique that seeks map-

pings between high-dimensional inputs and low-dimensional rep-

resentations such that representation dimensions correspond to the ground-truth factors that generated the data [83]. Accordingly, some proposed disentanglement measures [16, 84] as a way to evaluate a GenAI model’s interpretability. A recent study by Ross et al. [86] proposed a user evaluation task to evaluate the human interpretability of generative models, by the ability for people to interactively modify representations to reconstruct target instances.

Others explored visualization approaches to present the repre-

sentations to help users (often model developers) make sense of what the GenAI model has learned. For example, Ross et al. [86] use sliders to let users dynamically modify representation dimensions and see how corresponding instances change. Recent HCI works also explored the approach of “explainability through interaction" for generative models, by allowing users to interact with the input or guiding output generation process [59, 60, 86, 103]. Through observing immediate feedback from changes to the model output, people can make better sense of how a generative model works. For example, Zhang and Banovic developed a system that allows users to interactively explore the output space of an image generative model to assess the model quality [103].

These varied approaches suggest that explainability is still a less than well-defined notion for GenAI. Here we adopt a HCXAI posi-

tion that explainability, or the effectiveness of explanation, should be defined as enabling people’s understanding of the AI to achieve their goals [52]. With this human-centered definition, many have ar-

gued that it is necessary to provide transparent information beyond the model internals, such as its performance, limitations, training data, and development procedure, to enable a holistic understanding of the AI and more actionable insights [11, 48, 73, 94]. As discussed, Liao et al. proposed to identify users’ explainability needs by elic-

iting the questions they ask to understand the AI [48, 50]. This method allows approaching XAI from the users’ perspective and thoroughly identify transparent information they need to achieve

an understanding necessary for their goals, which, in the context of GenAI for code, could be about optimizing for the usage of the AI system and overall productivity. Liao et al.’s work was based on prior HCI work that defines “intelligibility types" of information for context-aware intelligent systems by prototypical questions such

as Input, Output, Why, What-if, etc. [53, 54]. It also draws on social science literature showing that people’s explanatory goals can be expressed in different kinds of questions [34]. We build on this line of work and adapt the question-drive method to elicit users’ explainability needs for GenAI for code.

# 2.3 Human-centered approaches to AI

The term Human-centered AI has emerged in many academic works and public discussions [22, 25, 45, 65, 85, 89]. While definitions vary, human-centered approaches to AI aim to develop AI systems that serve the needs, improve the conditions, and align with the val-

ues of human stakeholders. Research begins to develop practical methods that can help achieve these goals. One set of methods gained much attention lately under the umbrella term of “partic-

ipatory machine learning” [32, 46, 97]. Built on the tradition of participatory design, participatory machine learning emphasizes involving stakeholders, especially affected marginalized groups, into the development process early on to shape the overall goals and design choices of ML systems. Some suggested that abstracting user values from their participatory input is especially effective to guide ML modeling choices such as defining its optimization functions, features, constraints, and so on [49, 68, 105]. This notion of driving technical development based on insights from empirical user studies is also at the core of broad IUI research [5].

One challenge to involving users to shape the design and techni-

cal development of AI systems is that these systems often do not exist yet for people to experience and provide realistic feedback. This challenge can be tackled by human-centered methods that allow “envisioning future use possibilities”. One effective method is scenario-based design (SBD) [87]. SBD suspends the needs to define system operations by using narrative descriptions of how a user uses a system to accomplish a task, allowing people to respond to concrete interactions. We chose to use SBD to explore GenAI for code use cases as most software engineers do not have experience with such technologies. SBD also allows us to explore XAI design without the constraint of current technical feasibility, as adopted by several prior XAI works [19, 102].

# 3 METHODOLOGY: SCENARIO-BASED DESIGN WORKSHOPS

We conducted 9 semi-structured workshops, with 3-6 participants in each, which lasted for 60-70 minutes. Due to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, participants joined the workshop remotely via a video conferencing tool. We also used Mural1, which provides visual workspaces for virtual collaboration. Each workshop was based on one of three use cases of GenAI for code: code translation, code autocompletion, and natural language to code. In the following, we first introduce the three use cases then describe the workshop in detail, then participants and analysis.

# 3.1 Use Cases and Scenarios

We focus on three specific use cases of GenAI for code, based on the preferred choices that could deliver high value for software

engineering tasks from a pre-study survey with 81 people who responded to our study recruitment message.

- Code translation, in which a generative model translates source code from one language (e.g., Java) to another (e.g., Python). This task has been an important benchmark for technical work in GenAI for code [61] and has gained extensive attention from both industry and academia [3, 23, 30, 88, 99]. Such technologies can significantly reduce the cost and expertise barriers for code modernization work, in which a legacy codebase is ported to a modern programming language.
- Code autocompletion, in which a generative model takes comments and source code as input (e.g. a function specification and/or signature), and produces code as output (e.g. the implementation of the function). This use case can fulfill pervasive needs of software engineers to improve their productivity and efficiency. Notably, autocompletion is one of the primary functions of GitHub Copilot.
- Natural language to code, in which a generative model takes natural language (e.g. “change the color of the button to blue”) and produces code as output (e.g. button.setColor(Color.blue)). This use case is another function offered by GitHub Copilot and represents a promising way to reduce entry barriers to programming.

For each use case, we created a persona, Alex, who is a software engineer working in a team. In the scenario given to participants, Alex and his teammates are introduced to an AI system to support their work. They are told that they could ask for more information and new functions added to the AI system to help them understand and work better with the AI. Figure 1 (b) shows the description of the persona for the code auto-completion use case. A concrete scenario of a programming task that Alex would perform is shown in Figure 1 (c), and we show the programming tasks of the other two use cases (i.e., code translation and code autocompletion) in Appendix A.

To give participants a realistic experience, all AI-produced code in our scenarios was generated using state-of-the-art generative code models. We used TransCoder [88] for the code translation use case and Copilot [27] for the other two use cases. For the code translation use case, we selected a programming solution to the problem of converting integers to their Roman numeral representations.2 One reason we selected this code example is that there was a subtle bug in the translation generated by TransCoder [88]. This bug was pointed out by the workshop facilitator when introducing the scenario, to allow us to probe on participants’ reactions to the limitations of the AI. For the code autocompletion and natural language to code use cases, we selected a programming solution to the problem of counting the number of prime numbers from a given input. We sampled this problem from Project CodeNet [77], a large dataset of code samples. Based on CodeNet’s metadata, the acceptance rate of Python solutions for this problem is lower than 50%, indicating that it is a non-trivial coding problem for which GenAI models might provide assistance.

2We selected a Java implementation of this problem from https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com.

# 3.2 Workshop Format and Procedure

In each workshop, the facilitator first stated the purpose of the workshop, introduced concepts about generative AI for code, and asked for participants’ verbal consent and permission to record. Then, the facilitator started the recording and introduced the Alex persona and one of the programming problem scenarios described above. The main part of the workshop was carried out in two stages: first, an open-ended question elicitation exercise to understand participants’ explainability needs in the given scenario; and second, an ideation session in which 4 types of XAI features were used as design probes to elicit feedback and design ideas, to be described below. The content of the persona, scenario, and design probes were customized based on which use case was selected for the workshop. All discussions and screen activities were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, together with the content on the Mural pages.

# 3.2.1 Stage 1: Question elicitation exercise

The first stage of the workshop was designed to elicit what kinds of questions participants would have for understanding the GenAI in the given scenario, based on the question-driven approach to XAI design proposed by Liao et al. [48, 50]. After describing Alex’s persona and the task scenario, the workshop facilitator asked participants: “Put yourself in Alex’s shoes, what does Alex want to know? What questions does Alex want to ask about the natural language to code model/AI?” Participants were given several minutes to come up as many questions they could, posted as sticky notes on the Mural page. Next, the facilitator worked with participants to collaboratively cluster similar questions together. Participants were asked to speak out loud as they moved around the sticky notes to describe their thought process and rationale. This process encouraged participants to read each other’s questions, ask for clarifications, and have discussions. After the clustering, the facilitator chose one sticky note in each cluster to represent the cluster, then invited participants to cast up to 3 votes for questions they considered to be the most important to address. After the voting session, participants were asked to share their rationales behind the votes to exchange ideas and stimulate new ideas.

# 3.2.2 Stage 2: Ideation on XAI features

In addition to exploring general explainability needs, our study also aims to explore a few areas to develop XAI features that can address these needs. Given the novelty in both the technical XAI approaches for GenAI and the application domain, we adapted existing ideas from XAI solutions for discriminative ML models as a starting point of our discussions. Liao et al. [50] provides a suggested mapping between prototypical user questions (e.g., why, performance, data, output) and XAI methods or features that can answer the questions, primarily in the context of discriminative AI for decision-support systems. We built upon this work, as well as other work that explores XAI or transparency features [10, 21, 31], to select and adapt features that could apply to the context of GenAI for code. We also took into consideration their technical feasibility and potential values they can provide for the use cases. Through this process, we arrived at the following XAI features:

- AI documentation is embodied by the recently-proposed concepts of FactSheets [8, 81], Model Cards [98], and About ML pages [78]. AI documentation is developed by AI model or

# AI Supported Software Engineering

# Our Goal

We are trying to understand what kinds of features can help…

# Meet Alex

Alex is a Software Engineer who works with 5 people as a team …

He and his teammates are offered an AI that can write Python code …

Everyone’s voice matters, speak out loud whenever you have anything to say!

# Judging

No right or wrong answers

They are informed that AI is not perfect and will likely make mistakes, and they can ask for more information that can help them understand the AI to work better with it.

# Success

Success is generating ideas of new features or what's needed to improve the user experience of AI for code.

# Natural language to Code “Base Case”

What questions does Alex want to ask about the model/AI?

def test():
number = int(input())
read = list of numbers from the user

The first attempt

Sometime it will not result in any response?

# How can

Alex input “read an integer…”

Can the AI write test case for a code it has written?

Can we do natural language to code something simple:

# Designs from the AI provider

What would Alex expect to be on the About Me Page?

An About Page to provide some facts about the natural language to code system.

# What does Alex want to know about his teammates' working with the natural language to code model?

Overview of the Mural used in workshop #6 (W6-NL2Code) for the code autocompletion use case. We introduce the workshop and set ground rules in (a), introduce the Alex persona in (b), and show the model output for the use case in (c). Then, we ask participants for what they want to know about the GenAI model in (d), elicit design ideas for AI documentation in (e), and ask participants to ideate on what information Alex would want to know about his team members’ use of the model in (f).

# System providers to give users information about its purpose, performance, safety, and provenance.

Liao et al. [48] suggest that this type of feature could be used to address several categories of explainability needs, including data, output, performance, and how (global logic) questions.

# Uncertainty indicator

Uncertainty is considered a critical form of transparency that can alert people about the limitations of AI [10].

# Attention visualization

Attention visualization is a type of local explanation to answer the why question [51]: why did the model produce a particular output for a given input?

# (d) Social Transparency

Figure 2: Examples of UI probes used in the code translation use case. Probes used in the other use cases were similar in design but differed in the specific code examples used. Each design is translated from existing XAI approaches for discriminative AI. The probes were designed to elicit questions and spark discussion around Alex’s information needs for working with a generative code model.

a distribution over attended-to input units [ 101] to indicate the relative importance of input units for the output. Prior work has shown how to use attention weights to visually depict which words in an input sequence, plus which words in previously-generated output, were responsible for a given token’s output [ 95 , 96 ]. In our design probe (Figure 2 (c)), we show the user querying a portion of output (in red) and seeing which tokens were responsible for that output (in yellow, where opacity is used to signal the strength of the attention weight). The opacities in the figure are based on the actual cross-attention weights from the model we used to generate the output.

• Social transparency makes transparent the social contexts around the usage of an AI system to help people better understand the AI and how to utilize it. This feature was inspired by a recent work by Ehsan and Riedl [21], which examined the impact of making other users’ past interactions with a decision-support AI system transparent. To explore social transparency in our context, we created an open-ended probe to invite ideation by visually emphasizing the fact that Alex is not working alone, but works within a group of other software engineers (Figure 2 (d)).

# 3.3 Participants

# Recruitment.

We advertised our study within a large international information technology company, by distributing a survey targeted at software engineers working across many product lines and locations. 81 people responded. In the recruiting survey, we asked questions about their demographic information, self-evaluation of programming skills and previous experience of working with AI. In addition, we asked them to rate their interest in the 6 candidate user cases of generative AI models for code (in addition to the 3 selected use cases we included test case generation, documentation generation and code repair).

# Selection Criteria.

For code autocompletion and natural language to code use cases, we required participants to have 1+ year of Python programming experience. For the code translation use case, we required participants to have 1+ year of both Python and Java programming experience. Among all sign-up responses, 56 (69%) had at least 1+ year of Python programming experience. From this set, we prioritized to select those who have had experience with AI systems, and we further narrowed down to 43 participants based on their time availability.

# Demographics.

For the geographical location, the majority of our participants were from the United States (N=22; 65%) and India

For the gender identity, 33 (77%) participants identified as male, 8 (19%) female, and 2 (5%) preferred not to answer. Our participants also had diverse job roles: 17 (40%) software engineers, 9 (21%) researchers/scientists, 9 (21%) data scientists, 5 (12%) software architects, 1 data engineer, 1 bioinformatician and 1 hardware verification engineer. Among them, 40 (93%) had experience working with AI in their jobs, while 3 of them did not.

Assignment. We then assigned participants to 9 workshops (3 for each use case) as shown in Table 1, where we mark participants who do not have experience working with AI in blue. Their coding independently with the agreed codes. As a result, they reached a high level of agreement on 66 out of 71 messages (93%). After another iteration of discussion to finalize the coding schema, one of the two researchers coded the rest of questions. We discuss findings from this analysis in Section 4.

For the rest of the workshops, we coded participants’ feedback and design ideas with regard to the four design probes. Our goal is to further understand users’ explainability needs in the context of generative AI, as well as to inform concrete XAI designs that can address these needs. This part of coding was conducted by one researcher with frequent discussions with the other researchers. We discuss these findings in Section 5.

# 3.4 Analysis

We conducted content analysis on the written content in Mural, and around 600 minutes of interviews were recorded and transcribed. In total, we extracted 487 messages from Mural and 249 paragraphs from the video transcript relevant to explainability. We followed the workshop structure, and coded the data in five parts: question elicitation exercise, discussions around AI documentation, uncertainty indicator, attention visualiser and social transparency.

To analyze the questions collected from the question elicitation exercise, we referred to prior work using prototypical questions to represent explainability needs by Liao et al. [48] in the context of discriminative ML systems, and “intelligibility types” [53, 54] for context-aware intelligent systems by Lim and Dey, and used these existing definitions to guide our coding. We also paid attention to new types of questions that were not covered in these prior works. Two researchers first independently coded 106 questions collected, and discussed their codes to reach a consensus. Then, they updated.

# 4 EXPLANABILITY NEEDS FOR GENAI FOR CODE

This section presents the results from the question elicitation exercise to understand what types of explainability needs participants had for the GenAI for code use cases. As mentioned, we followed the definitions of prototypical user questions in XAI Question Bank by Liao et al. [48] and “intelligibility types” in Lim and Dey [53] to code the following categories: Input, Output, Performance, Data, How (global), Why/Why NOT, How to, What if, Control. We further identified two new categories that were not covered by the prior works: System Requirements and Impact, and Limitations. In Table 2, we present these question categories, with their definitions, and example questions asked by participants. They are ordered by the frequency of being asked by participants. Categories unique to the GenAI for code are marked with a dagger (†) sign. Categories that appeared in Lim and Dey [53] but not Liao et al. [48] are marked with an asterisk (∗) sign. Below we enumerate each.

# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design

# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

# Question Category and What We Can Learn About Users’ Explainability Needs with GenAI for Code

# Input

To understand what kind of inputs the model can take or should be given was the most prominent explainability needs of participants, making up about 16% of all questions. On one hand, participants wanted to have an overview of the types or scope of inputs the AI can work with. Some asked about the AI’s ability to process types of programming languages, data types, algorithms, language versions, and so on. On the other hand, participants were eager to know how to optimize their inputs to produce better outputs. For example, participants in W4-CA raised the question “Should Alex write smaller functions that are easier to name or extensive documentation for complex functions?” and “Can I describe the entire problem in a single well-written sentence? or will I always need to break down the problem into small natural language chunks” asked by W6-NL2Code. Participants’ questions reflected their current mental models on how the GenAI works to process inputs, which were not necessarily accurate, suggesting that explanations may need to start from a high-level overview of how GenAI works in a specific code generation use case. It is interesting to note that this category is not a prominent need for decision-support AI using discriminative ML, since the input is often fixed or implicit. In contrast, the great variability and close coupling between input and output for GenAI made it a primary explainability needs to address.

# Output

To understand what output the GenAI can produce is another frequent explainability need. Participants were mainly interested in the characteristics of the output code, and the scope of the output or system functions. Understanding the characteristics of the output can help users determine how to utilize the output, for example P5 from W1-CT commented: “you cannot ask Python to be as efficient as Java, but at the same time, Python may be more convenient than Java in some specific situations...”. Understanding the characteristics can also guide users to assess the quality of output, identify potential shortcomings or errors for further actions, as commented by P19 from W4-CA: “if it’s translating from a language like RUST that doesn’t allow overflow, it’s not possible into a language like Java allows it.”. Meanwhile, some participants asked about the scope of the output, as to discover what the GenAI can do, such as whether it can generate test cases or multiple candidates as alternatives.

# How (Global)

Participants also recognized the importance of having a global understanding of the GenAI. Many wanted to have a high-level understanding of how the codes are generated, such as “how exactly does it generate code? is it pulling from sites or using GANs to generate new code” from W3-CA and “how the model comprehends the user input” from W6-NL2Code. Some raised these questions based on their expectations of the input and output of the model (e.g., “Python is dynamically typed, Java is static, how do you enforce these typing rules?” from W1-CT. Others inquired about how the model deals with specific types of input, such as “How untagged text is used for analysis” from W9-CA. These questions reflected interests in both a high-level description of how code generation works, and examining detailed model logic. For descriptive ML, global explanations often take the forms of showing how the model weighs different features or describing the general rules the predictions follow. How to communicate such a global view of model logic for GenAI is an open technical challenge.

# Performance

Many participants were concerned about understanding the performance, i.e. how well the GenAI works for the use case. These questions are critical for users to develop appropriate trust and adopt the system. We found the questions are mainly concerned about the overall performance, the quality of a specific generated code and the run-time efficiency of the model (e.g., inference time of the model, if the AI supports multi-threading). It is interesting to note that “quality of code” may be multi-faceted as participants mentioned correctness, runtime complexity, space complexity, understandability, and testability. Many of these performance-related questions were asked to understand performance differences and limitations with regard to different types of input (e.g. larger code). The interest in run-time performance is a unique need emerged in the GenAI for code context.

# How To

These questions inquired about how to change or improve the input to get a better output. Answers to these questions can help participants choose strategies to make better use of the AI, such as “How to [make] requirement better [to improve the output]”? from W9-CA and “How can I get the AI to write efficient code?” from W6-NL2Code.

# Control

These questions were regarding options to customize or specify preferences for how the model should work. This category was not seen in Liao et al.’s work defining explainability needs for decision-support discriminative ML. Emergence of this type of question in our context suggests that users of GenAI for code are interested in having more control on the working of the model, as illustrated by P61 from W1-CT saying that “Oftentimes, you’re not using the tool for just basic examples. I guess more in depth, like, explanations of what you can do with the model would be appreciated.”

# Why/Why Not (Local)

Different from asking How (global) questions to understand the overall process or logic of the model, a Why (local) question was asked to understand a specific output from the model. More often than not, the Why question was triggered by a surprising or suspicious output, such as “Why did the AI think the code satisfied the requirement?” at W7-NL2Code or “How did the AI recognize the function from comments in this task?” at W4-CA. Sometimes the Why question was asked in contrast to the expected output, and hence a Why Not (the expected output) question, such as “Why didn’t my input work?” from W3-CA.

# Data

Some participants brought up questions regarding the training data, especially regarding the provenance of the data, such as “Where does the code the AI was trained on come from?” from W3-CA. Echoing findings in Liao et al. [48], explanations on training.

# IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

# Jiao Sun et al.

Data can help users gauge the capability of the model and its proper usage, by the validity of the training data and their alignment with one’s own programming tasks. How to define alignment of training data in the context of GenAI, however, remains an open question.

# System Requirement and Impact

A new category emerged in our data that was not covered in prior works. This category is questions regarding requirements or impact of the system, which can help users gauge the appropriate conditions of usage. They were asked regarding the usage of the system instead of the underlying model. These questions were highly specific to the software engineer context, including compatible development environments, software and hardware requirements, dependencies, and so on.

# Limitations

Another category unique in our data is questions explicitly asking about the limitations of the model or system, such as what kind of scenarios it cannot cover or limitations to the model’s functions. These questions emerged likely due to the complexity of the input and output spaces of GenAI, which is less straightforward to comprehend than a decision-support AI system.

# What If

Some asked about what the output would be given hypothetical changes to the input, which may further help participants understand how the AI makes decisions in a counterfactual manner, such as “what to return if the input is invalid?” from W5-CT.

To summarize, we identified 11 categories of explainability needs in GenAI for code use cases. Four of these categories did not appear in Liao et al. as prominent needs for discriminative ML used for decision-support: Input, Control, System Requirements & Impact and Limitations. The top five most frequent categories are Input, Output, How (global), Performance and How to. In Section 6, we will further discuss insights revealed about explainability needs that are unique to the GenAI technology and the novel use case of supporting code generation.

# XAI Features for GenAI for Code

As discussed in Section 3.2, we proposed four types of XAI features for GenAI for code and created design probes to elicit ideation from participants: AI documentation, uncertainty indicator, attention visualizer, and social transparency. In this section we discuss participants’ response to derive concrete design recommendations.

# AI Documentation

AI documentation is advocated to increase the transparency and facilitate understanding of AI, and is embodied in recently proposed features of AI Factsheets and Model Cards. However, what documentation should include for generative AI models is under-investigated, let alone GenAI for code use cases. We are interested in what categories of information about the model should be presented in AI documentation for GenAI for code, and how they might differ from that of discriminative ML. We used a low-fidelity UI design of a factsheet with intentionally open-ended content, and asked participants to brainstorm AI documentation categories that could help the user in the design scenario.

We summarize the categories identified from data analysis in Table 3, ranked by the frequencies of mentions by participants. In particular, we identified categories that surfaced in the context of GenAI for code that were not discussed in previous works on AI FactSheets or Model Cards: Examples and tutorials, Software engineering capabilities, Output code quality and utility, Supported languages and frameworks, Control and Deployment Requirement & Platform.

Consistent with findings from the question elicitation exercise, participants expressed strong interests in understanding the scopes of inputs and outputs of the system. Examples and tutorials, as the most frequently mentioned category, suggests that example-based explanations can be a fruitful area to explore for GenAI to help users understand the model inputs and outputs. Such interests are also expressed as requirements specific for software engineering tasks, including Software engineering capabilities and Supported languages and frameworks. Participants also wished to see information about performance, data, control, system deployment requirement, and global model explanations, suggesting that providing documentation could help address corresponding explainability needs.

Another interesting pattern is that participants requested categories of information regarding the generated code artefacts rather than the model itself. Many demanded to see metrics about the code quality and utility, which should be differentiated from model performance metrics such as accuracy. While the latter are commonly calculated with some ground-truth in a held-out test dataset, the former are concerned with characterizing the generated code and their utility for improving human productivity.

In general, documentation for GenAI for code should be transparent about the quality of the produced code from the software engineering perspective, and align with the professional culture and standards, such as communicating the license and regulatory requirements in both the training data acquisition and the usage of the produced code. Table 3 is not meant to serve as an exhaustive template for AI documentation of generative AI models for code. Instead, we hope that these discovered categories can inspire what to document for generative AI models for code.

# Model Uncertainty

Inspired by previous work on model uncertainty of generative AI models for code and communicating uncertainty of output for discriminative ML models, we created the design probe to communicate uncertainty for a line of AI generated code, indicated by a wavy underline. We asked participants to react to the feature and discuss how to improve the feature, including follow-up interactions, to better support users’ understanding and their usage of the AI system.

Their suggested improvement and follow-up interactions can be categorized as AI initiated and human initiated. For the AI to take the initiative, participants suggested to see more information from the model to help them understand the output and edit if necessary, for example to include suggesting alternative outputs, providing uncertainty explanations, and giving more fine-grained uncertainty.

# Alternative Outputs

Participants wanted transparency about what other alternatives the AI model had considered as output. Some participants had low expectations of generated code and hoped to...

Table 3: Categories of AI documentation for GenAI for code models and their outputs. Categories are sorted in descending order, based on the frequency of mention by participants. Categories marked with a † or ∗ have not been identified by previous works in AI documentation. We postulate that categories marked with a dagger (†) emerged due to the context of generative models, and categories marked with an asterisk (∗) emerged due to the context of software engineering support.

gain insights from more options, as P63 from W3-CA stated that “I voted for the multiple [version] candidates, which I think is just generally helpful. Even if the top generated candidate was not quite right maybe one of the top five will be. Or will be better for whatever the particular use cases.”. Some participants hoped to see alternatives with specific characteristics (e.g., better readability or optimization), as P80 from W6-NL2Code stated: “Obviously if human knows about the time complexity and the optimization of the code, he can fetch a better one. And at present, we do not know whether [the] AI [is] trying to be more on the readable side or more on the optimization side.”

# Uncertainty explanation.

Participants desired to see uncertainty explanation from the model, on why a particular part of the code was highlighted or why the AI was uncertain. This is an under-explored area in XAI. Participants suggested that the sources for uncertainty explanations could be what alternative options the model was struggling with (W8-NL2Code), or what goal or rationale the model follows (W6-NL2Code). We quote P71 from W6-NL2Code who proposed an interactive explanation to address this point:

“I’ve voted twice for an indication of what the model is trying to achieve, because I think that’s very important. It could be very simple. It could be as simple as just reminding you exactly what natural language prompt this was derived from, so you can think to yourself: ‘what was it trying to do?’ Uh, based on what I wrote, cause I know what I wrote, and I know what that means and then I can rewrite it from there or it could be more complex. It could, you know, if there’s a serious natural

# Jiao Sun et al.

language model behind this, maybe it’s capable of gen-

erating speech back to me about what this code exactly does and then you can compare that yourself.

Another path to explain uncertainty suggested by participants was through highlighting corresponding parts that contributed to the uncertainty. The corresponding parts could be from input, previously generated lines, or training data.

# Fine-grained uncertainty

Some participants wanted to see more than just a wavy line under outputs that are below an uncertainty threshold. For example, P71 from W6-NL2Code said: “...if there is some confidence percentage that could be helpful to, you know, like Green Zone, Red zone and Yellow zone etc., to give an idea of the highest priority I need to fix this.” Related to the observation that code quality is multi-faceted, some participants wanted to understand the specific definition or aspect of uncertainty, such as whether it is regarding the correctness, time complexity, or runtime.

Another area of suggested interactions requires the human to take the initiative, including allowing human input to resolve uncertainty and supporting interactive testing for the uncertain regions, as discussed below.

# Human input to resolve uncertainty

A frequently requested interaction was that the AI waits for human input to resolve uncertainty. This could be realized by the AI prompting the human with a variety of questions, including confirmation (W3-CA), clarification (e.g., “show did you mean ... options” from W1-CT), inspection (e.g., “Tell user to examine the line carefully and verify” from W4-CA), preferences or how they would code (e.g., “Ask user for decision making – ‘do you want to keep this line or not’ and highlight it with reasoning” from W5-CT), and immediate modification (e.g., “Dialog box to type preferred translation (if Alex knows python)” from W2-CT).

# Interactive testing

Another interaction that participants expected to perform is interactive testing for situations in which the model was uncertain, which can also facilitate understanding of the AI model. P81 from W6-NL2Code said that “... If we can probably give a similar interactive component [as Jupyter Notebook] where it gives you the option to fetch a context from the previous clients, and then run only that piece of code to see what the output is. Probably the person can make a better decision on whether to keep it or change.”

The overall feedback from participants was that showing a line-level uncertainty indicator would be useful to guide users’ attention to potentially low-quality code. However, showing uncertainty alone was not enough to satisfy their explainability needs. Many of the suggested interactions also serve the purpose of helping users better understand the model behaviors through interactive testing, alternative output it considered, and explaining the uncertainty. Through these interactions, users can develop a more appropriate mental model of the system that can help them interact more effectively in the long run.

# Attention Distribution

Attention distribution is a popular approach to explain an individual prediction made by a neural networks model, by the relative importance of parts of input to determine the output [95, 96]. Mapping to the context of GenAI for code, we designed the UI in Figure 2c, where the user can select a span of generated content. The AI can then highlight some spans in the previous content, to illustrate the idea of attention when making local decisions, indicating different attention weights via different opacity. We showed it to participants to gather their response on the utility of attention distribution visualizer for users of GenAI for code.

In general, participants said that the attention features would be useful to help them understand how the model worked, and to guide them in modifying the input to produce better results. P42 from W7-NL2Code said that “It’s what trains me as the user to use the AI better” and P63 from W3-CA said that “if you see an issue, you might be able to say, oh, I can go back and try tweaking this part of the input and see whether I can get a better result. So that could be useful.”

Participants also proposed potential ways to improve this local explanation feature. For example: 1) line-level interpretation might be more appropriate than the span level, as P53 in W3-CA said: “selecting a span may not be the best option for a user interface; potentially a line is better”; 2) being able to make immediate changes “right after identifying the suspicious spots” via such a tool (P55 in W4-CA); 3) syntax tree driven selection so that “if you click on the range, you should get the whole function not only the span” (P63 in W3-CA); 4) adding natural language explanation in addition to the color coding (P71 in W6-NL2Code and P22 in W8-NL2Code).

Moreover, participants saw value in utilizing user edits or interaction with attention distribution as signals to improve the model or future interactions, for example, collecting the user edits, as P63 in W3-CA said that “it might be more useful for how do we improve the model? Cause if somebody... starts typing in, here’s the code that I really wanted here. And you can see how does that align and say, wait, why isn’t this aligning? It might be more useful is user feedback back to the model builders.”

# Social Transparency

Social transparency (ST) in AI system is recently proposed by Ehsan et al. [19], built on the concept of social transparency in social computing [90]. ST makes visible socio-organizational factors that influence the use of AI by presenting other users’ interactions with the AI, aiming to facilitate a better understanding of and effective actions with AI output. To explore ST in the context of GenAI for code, we introduced an open-ended probe in Figure 2d: an image highlighting that Alex was not working alone but together with a team of software engineers, all using the GenAI. We asked participants to ideate on what users might want to know about other team members’ interactions with the AI to help them better understand and use the AI. We asked participants to write down their ideas in Mural, and then did the clustering, voting and sharing again. We collected 111 responses about ST from Mural, grouped them to categories, and sorted them based on the frequencies of their occurrences. With the open-ended probe, we were able to elicit user needs for ST in the broad context of software engineer work with the participation of GenAI for code. We therefore map the findings to a stage model of the software development life cycle based on Rani [79]: 1) Requirement Analysis; 2) Design; 3) Implementation; 4) Testing; 5) Deployment and Maintenance [79].

# Investigating Explainability of Generative AI for Code through Scenario-based Design

IUI ’22, March 22–25, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

At the stage of requirement analysis, participants wanted to know about the team information of who, and for what, will be using the AI, such as business requirements and goals of the team, information about each team member (e.g., programming skills and experience), their interaction patterns with the AI (e.g., who is frequently using AI and who is better at using AI) and the reason why they are using the AI. Knowing the team information early on could help users better coordinate and interpret ST information in later stages.

Information about other people’s experience with the AI could help at the design stage so that users could better design their programming tasks with the GenAI, including taking precautions on when and how they need to take more control on the code generation. It is especially helpful to learn about the AI’s performance, capability and limitations from others’ experience at this stage. For example, participants wanted to know how other people had evaluated the performance of the model and their judgement of the code quality, including how much time they invested in getting started with AI, how the AI-generated code compared to human-written code, together with the strengths and weaknesses of the AI. Moreover, they were interested in seeing limitations, such as common pitfalls and errors that other members had experienced.

Going into the development stage, participants wanted to have information about similar tasks or requests of other people to better understand what the AI model was capable of doing, even re-use the generated content, to help them better manage the programming tasks. Some participants expressed a desire to always have clarity on the authoring entity of code (whether from AI, a colleague, or other resources) throughout the development stage to better manage their expectations, actions as well as accountability.

At the testing stage, participants wished to know how other people had tested the AI model as a reference, including what measures they had used in their evaluation of code quality. Many requested to understand AI’s impact on humans at this stage, i.e. how the introduction of the AI influenced the productivity of the team members, such as team speed and productivity. They also wanted to know whether and how the AI-generated code might be added to the codebase.

Finally, during the deployment and maintenance stage, participants asked for information about how to customize the model parameters and monitored metrics based on the preferences of the team, and how to collect the team’s edits and feedback to improve the model.

These results move beyond Ehsan et al. [19] ’s work that defined ST features at the point of AI decision-support. Our results open up the design space to embed rich ST features at different stages of software development. ST features in the context of GenAI for code can not only facilitate users to better understand and use the AI, but also potentially foster a more effective “human-AI assemblage" where GenAI is introduced as a member or assistant of a software engineer team. We encourage future work to further explore the design space.

# 6 DISCUSSION

# 6.1 Informing XAI approaches for GenAI for code

The rich and complex inputs and outputs of GenAI, and the tight coupling of the two, make it a prominent need for users to form a clear mental model on the scope, characteristics, and limitations of the input and output spaces, as well as a global view of how the model generates outputs from inputs. The observation that participants’ explainability needs focused overwhelmingly on input, output and global explanations, suggests a mismatch between what users of GenAI applications need and the technical community’s current focus on explanations for representation learning and visualizing representations.

The explainability categories we identified have varied technical feasibility with current techniques, and point to topics that are under-explored for generative AI. For example, for the Performance category, existing works have used the Computational Accuracy metric to evaluate generative code models [9, 15, 33, 88], but not other metrics we uncovered regarding the characteristics of the generated artifacts and run-time efficiency. To understand performance differences and limitations with regard to different types of input, solutions have been explored for natural language generation under Prompt Engineering [57, 58]. Similar studies in the code space are limited to the number of few-shot examples in the prompt, and the effect of length of prompt on performance [9, 15]. A more detailed analysis of these phenomenon, better grounded in the semantics of programming languages, could be a promising area for future research. For the Control category, it is feasible to directly interact with model parameters. However, questions of how to elicit human feedback or edits and incorporate them to train generative models are currently under explored.

XAI for GenAI needs to be contextualized by the characteristics of the generated artifacts, and the practical and cultural contexts to use these artifacts, i.e. the software engineering domain in our case. For example, participants were interested in understanding the input and output spaces with regard to supported language, frameworks, data structures, and so on. They are also interested in metrics reflecting various aspects of code characteristics and impact on human productivity rather than technical accuracy alone.

Participants’ questions reflected their desire for an actionable or utility-oriented understanding to support their end goal of optimizing code generation and programming productivity [18, 50, 52], such as asking the Input, Output, How and How-to XAI questions (described in Section 4) to facilitate strategies to get better outputs from the AI. This actionable understanding can also be supported by enabling follow-up actions towards their goals after seeing transparent information. For example, participants suggested many interactions to allow them to act on uncertainty information and improve the generated code.

In short, explainability needs should be understood and addressed with the ecological factors in mind, situated in an understanding of the behavioral and social contexts of the system [41, 70]. We paid attention to the nature of software engineer tasks and workflows as part of the pragmatic human environment of the system. For example, participants demanded information regarding system requirements and impacts in relation to their broader work.

# 6.2 Design implications for GenAI for code

In our study, we observed a positive user reception towards natural language explanations and interactions with the GenAI as user inputs are programming- or natural-language based. We envision that a conversational agent interface could be a natural fit for AI assistant for code or co-programming tools, as explored in recent work [42, 43].

We also noticed that the explainability needs and user needs in general may differ for users with varied levels of programming skills. Less experienced participants generally asked fewer questions in the workshop. It is possible that they face more challenges articulating or realizing they had certain explainability needs, and may benefit from more proactive explanations or an entire interaction session focusing on training and explaining rather than in-situ explanations. Future research should further explore user needs in GenAI for code use cases that target reducing programming barriers and enabling novices to code.

Lastly, the bulk of explainability needs around GenAI for code leads to the question of utility of GenAI for code itself. One concern stems from the assumption that users are burdened with understanding how the AI works and adjusting their inputs for optimal outcomes, as expressed by P7 in W8-NL2Code: “as you were talking about this in this session, I keep thinking, if you are learning about all the use cases and how you’re going to structure the natural language and everything, how is it kind of different than just learning an actual language?”. We also note that at the current time, generative code models are prone to errors and will require post-generation improvements from humans [69, 100]. There is a fundamental question on the readiness of the technology, which may not be able to be addressed by providing explainability alone. We urge the AI and HCI community to evaluate GenAI for code technologies, define intended use, and refrain from use cases that have not been validated or have risks of harmful consequences for stakeholders.

# 6.3 Human-centered, participatory, and question-driven approaches to XAI design

Our study used a scenario-based design [87] combined with a question-driven method to elicit explainability needs, based on work by Liao et al. [48, 50]. We reflect on a few strategies that worked well for our study, and encourage researchers and practitioners to adopt similar approaches to understand users’ explainability needs early-on to drive technical and design choices.

First, we found the use of a scenario, persona and an illustrated prototype corresponding to the scenario to effectively aid the elicitation of rich user questions, even for a technology that was completely new for participants. As Liao et al. [50] suggested “for highly novel systems, scenarios or low-fi prototypes can be used to elicit questions”. Moreover, we incorporated real outputs from state-of-the-art generative code models in the low-fi prototype to illustrate the model capabilities, which was repeatedly inquired by participants to confirm the scenario has a realistic reflection of the GenAI capabilities. This approach also echoes a recent trend in AI design to utilize real data points as “data probes” to aid design ideation [91]. The choice of data point can sway the discussions in the user study. We suggest to choose ones that reflect the AI’s true capabilities, including limitations and errors to explore the design space more thoroughly.

Second, we found the procedure of “pooling-clustering-voting” questions to be productive. While Liao et al. [50]’s original method only deals with question elicitation in one-on-one interviews, we adopted a participatory workshop format to balance between individual brainstorming and group discussions. Giving participants seven minutes to post their questions allowed a quantity of questions to be added. Working collaboratively to cluster them and vote on the clusters encouraged discussions and building upon each other’s ideas. This procedure also allowed participants to naturally articulate reasons behind their questions for our data collection.

Lastly, in addition to the question elicitation exercise, we explored four types of XAI features with low-fi prototypes. We defined these features based on prior works in different technical and application domains. A critical study design decision we had to make is the open-endedness of these prototypes. For some features (uncertainty indicators and attention visualizers), there already exist relevant techniques, so we chose a more concrete design to elicit feedback and ideas for extension. For other features (documentation and ST), the design space is less defined so we used more open-ended probes to allow participants to freely and critically brainstorm. In short, the design of a “probe” for participatory ideation and feedback is a non-trivial design decision, requiring a balance between concreteness and openness, considerations of both technical feasibility and user value, and diligent pilot testing [12, 24].

# 7 CONCLUSION

Despite growing efforts to apply state-of-the-art GenAI models to support software engineering tasks, investigations on user needs for such technologies have been scarce. Our work is among the first to study users’ explainability needs of GenAI for code. By combining scenario-based design [87] and a recently proposed question-driven design method for XAI [48, 50], we conducted 9 participatory workshops with 43 software engineers to understand their explainability needs with three use cases of GenAI for code: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. As a result, we identified 11 categories of explainability needs in the context of GenAI for code. We provided detailed definitions and examples for these categories, and contrasted them with common explainability needs for discriminative ML discussed in prior work [48, 53]. In addition, we proposed four areas of XAI features for these use cases, collected feedback from participants and provided concrete design recommendations. We hope that our results can inspire future AI and HCI work that can enable better human-AI collaboration for software engineering, and encourage more human-centered approaches to drive AI technical development.

# Code Autocomplete “Base Case”

- Alex finds a problem in an online coding platform and wants to test if AI can do it!

- The problem description is: write a program which reads a list of N integers and prints the number of prime numbers in the list.

- Input: the number of elements in the list, and N numbers are given in the same line.

- Output: the number of prime numbers in the input.

def count_prime_numbers_from_input(input_number):
count = 0
for i in range(input_number):
if is_prime(i):
count += 1
return count

- First attempt: Alex wants AI to complete the code from function name, so he tried to come up with a function name that is almost describing everything.

- He realized that he should not have put arguments other than that, the program seems to be doing its job.

- Fourth attempt: Alex wonders what if he does not specify the requirement in the function name, instead, he wrote it down as comments.

- AI seems to be working well.

# Figure 3

The two other code "base cases" we used in the workshop on Mural. C1 is the example we used as the base case for the workshops about code translation (W1-CT, W2-CT and W5-CT), and C2 is for the code autocompletion use case (W3-CA, W4-CA and W9-CA). The C in Figure 1 is the base code base for the natural language to code use case (W6-NL2Code, W7-NL2Code, W8-NL2Code).

# THE OTHER TWO USE CASES

We show the example code as the base case for workshops about natural language to code (W6-NL2Code, W7-NL2Code, W8-NL2Code) in Figure 1. As a supplement, we show how we replace Figure 1 (c) with other code examples in Figure 3 for the code translation and code autocompletion use cases. The other sub-figures in Figure 1 stay almost the same for all workshops across all use cases with minimum edits.

# ABSTRACT

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, has revolutionized the business world, with benefits including improved accessibility, efficiency, and cost reduction. This article reviews recent developments of generative AI in business and finance, summarizes its practical applications, provides examples of the latest generative AI tools, and demonstrates that generative AI can revolutionize data analysis in industry and academia. To test the ability of generative AI to support decision-making in financial markets, we use the ChatGPT to capture corporate sentiments towards environmental policy by inputting text extracted from corporate financial statements.

# 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about an unprecedented transformation in every aspect of society. In recent decades, its emergence has significantly influenced business and management (Korzynski et al. 2023; Singh et al., 2022), financial markets (Scepanovic et al. 2023; Wan et al. 2021), healthcare (Senior 2023), education (Yang 2023), productivity (Noy and Zhang 2023), and climate action (Debnath et al. 2022). Over the past few months, the latest AI technique, generative AI, has caused a massive stir in academia and industry worldwide. Despite its great importance and potential, generative AI has sparked ongoing debates in news media outlets such as Yahoo!Finance1 and Forbes2, regarding its ethical challenges to protecting data privacy, social justice and equality, and energy consumption. This has also led to calls for further efforts to improve its associated regulatory framework. In addition, several technical challenges limit the ability to maximize the benefits of generative AI for industry and academia.

Future research and practice need to focus on developing generative AI applications in a reasonable, logical, compliant, and beneficial manner, which requires mutual collaboration.

improvements in regulations and technology to detect malicious uses. This study outlines the prospects of generative AI in business and finance, compares practical examples of the capabilities of three widely used generative AI tools (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard), presents a case study of a generative AI application, and discusses the ethical issues and limitations of generative AI tools. Despite the current controversy surrounding generative AI, our empirical analysis acknowledges its positive aspects for market participants and researchers based on the finding that it can effectively inform firms’ risk management capabilities.

Although generative AI was introduced in 1966, when Joseph Weizenbaum proposed the generative AI program ELIZA at MIT, the development of generative AI technologies did not take off until 2020, when OpenAI introduced Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3 (GPT-3). Generative AI builds on the technical development of descriptive AI, summarizing or analyzing data and generating new samples that do not exist in the database by learning historical data patterns (Orzechowski and Moore 2022; Savage 2023). Although generative AI encompasses a wide range of models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Large Language Models (LLMs) are the models most frequently explored in business and finance studies (i.e. Lopez-Lira and Tang 2023). LLMs are trained on billions of textual data from various sources, and they can capture the complexity of natural language and construct the relationships between different words to serve users’ specific text generation goals (Savage 2023). The most popular LLM tool, ChatGPT, was launched by OpenAI in November 2022 (Dwivedi et al. 2023) and trained on a large text corpus as a chatbot to process natural language and generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. In just two months, ChatGPT’s monthly active users grew to 100 million (Clarke 2023). OpenAI followed in March 2023 with the most powerful generative AI, GPT-4, which proved to have significant advantages over earlier GPT versions in several tasks (Buberk et al. 2023). Other large companies invest heavily in developing the latest LLMs, such as Meta with LLaMA and Google with Bard.

As many generative AI tools have emerged in a short period, they have come to be seen as capable of bringing about a massive revolution in the financial and business sectors. Therefore, using them efficiently and recognizing their limitations has become the next major topic of research interest. There have been several successful generative AI applications in the business and finance sectors. For example, Microsoft’s combination of its Bing search engine and ChatGPT resulted in New Bing, which can better understand proposed questions, generate more reliable and comprehensive answers, and provide answers with creative capabilities based on appropriate prompts. In addition, many companies use generative AI tools to create videos for product design and thus increase operational efficiency (Gil, 2020), provide 24-hour digital customer service that is consistently polite and patient, or offer marketing services such as customer-oriented promotions for special events. Given the robust capabilities of generative AI, its use in business and finance fields is expected to become increasingly widespread.

Generative AI is a double-edged sword, given its potential limitations and ethical concerns. Intending to promote the sustainable development and application of generative AI technology, we specifically link relevant debates to business and finance through a comprehensive overview of the academic and business sectors and specific examples to illustrate our views. The examples in Section 3 suggest that ChatGPT 4

outperforms ChatGPT 3.5 and Bard in following user instructions to provide personalized service, risk management, and decision support. In Section 4, we test the ability of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 to perform sentiment analysis in financial studies. Our results show that the negative sentiment of companies captured by ChatGPT 4 can predict better risk management capabilities and less volatile stock performance after introducing an environmental policy, which can prompt investors to adjust their portfolios promptly. In Section 5, our examples demonstrate one of the limitations of generative AI: the responses generated by ChatGPT are sensitive to tiny differences in the prompt template.

This study contributes to the literature on generative AI techniques in business and finance to provide insights into their practical and potential applications. Most studies in this stream only briefly mention how generative AI can be applied in business (Ali and Aysan 2023; George, George, and Martin 2023) and academia (Alshater 2022; Dowling and Lucey 2023; Korinek 2023; Singh and Singh 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth 2022) without performing in-depth investigation by using generative AI tools. For example, Cao and Zhai (2023) offer specific examples and recommendations for using ChatGPT as a potential technical aid to finance and accounting researchers. We differ from previous studies by providing a case study that uses ChatGPT to analyze firms’ sentiments towards policy implementation. Our empirical results suggest that generative AI can inform firms about their risk management capabilities, making it an ideal decision-support tool in financial markets. Besides, we also add to the literature on the opportunities and challenges that generative AI poses for development (Beraja, Yang, and Yuchtman 2023; Gherhes et al. 2023; Lu and Zhou 2021; Yin, Cai, and Huang 2023; Zhou et al. 2020) by providing guidance on building a regulatory framework for generative AI to address its limitations and concerns, and highlight important questions for further interdisciplinary research on generative AI in business and finance.

The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a broad overview of the literature on the applications and limitations of generative AI in business and finance. Section 3 outlines the applications of generative AI in different domains within the business and finance sectors, using practical examples. In Section 4, we explore the potential of ChatGPT, a dominant LLM, to analyze corporate sentiment scores towards policy implementation. Section 5 discusses current ethical concerns and limitations of generative AI techniques and provides recommendations for regulating generative AI in finance and business for sustainable development. Section 6 concludes the article and identifies relevant areas for further research.

# 2. Literature review

As one of the mainstream AI techniques, Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms have been used extensively in business and finance in the last few decades. Most of these studies leverage textual information, finding relationships between high-frequency texts and emerging trends. For example, Herzenstein et al. (2011) show that narratives significantly impact lending decisions by distributing different contextual information. Agarwal et al. (2016) find that the value of linguistic tone in credit rating action reports is closely associated with abnormal returns. Hassan et al. (2019) use an extended computational method for earnings conference calls to illustrate that firms’ political risks are closely related to their stock returns and investments. More recently, state-of-the-art NLP

Algorithms, known as transformer models, have also been applied in business and financial studies (Korangi, Mues, and Bravo 2023; Stevenson, Mues, and Bravo 2021). Unlike traditional NLP models, generative AI can easily create interactions, generate designs, and even fabricate fake texts. For example, Brynjolfsson et al. (2023) demonstrate that generative AI does not require input instructions because it recognizes patterns from training sets. The preceding research has pointed out that the application of generative AI in business and finance is still in its infancy. Dowling and Lucey (2023) pioneer the use of the most widely used generative AI tool, ChatGPT, to generate ideas and identify data in financial research. Their findings suggest that researcher expertise and the level of data input can have an essential impact on ChatGPT output results; they also highlight the relative weakness of this technique in creating literature reviews. From the perspective of policy-related research, Hansen and Kazinnik (2023) investigate the ability of GPT and other advanced NLP models to decipher Fedspeak, or statements detailing the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve. Based on a human classification benchmark, their results suggest that GPT models performed the best. Concurrently, Yang and Menczer (2023) investigate whether ChatGPT can be used to determine the credibility of news outlets. Their results indicate that the ratings generated by ChatGPT are highly correlated with those of human experts. Furthermore, their results suggest that ChatGPT could be an affordable reference for credibility ratings in fact-checking applications. Beam (2023) points out that online surveys via chatbots are an attractive means of conducting surveys cost-effectively in global settings. In addition, chatbot surveys lead to higher disclosure rates on potentially sensitive topics.

Most articles in the business and finance sectors have focused on the discussion of the prospects of generative AI (Ali and Aysan 2023; ChatGpt and Demir 2023; George, George, and Martin 2023; Lu et al. 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth 2022). For instance, Eckerli and Osterrieder (2021) provide an overview of how GANs generate financial data, summarizing their capabilities and limitations in current financial studies. The authors conclude that GANs have made substantial progress in financial applications and can be powerful tools for data scientists in this field. Lopez-Lira and Tang (2023) explore the potential of LLMs in predicting stock market returns using a sentiment analysis of news headlines, concluding that ChatGPT outperforms other NLP models and can improve the performance of quantitative trading strategies. Korinek (2023) summaries 25 cases in six areas (ideation, writing, background research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical derivation) where LLMs are becoming useful assistants and suggest that LLMs will greatly increase the productivity of microeconomics studies and produce economic models in the long term. As the most popular generative AI technique, ChatGPT shapes the way people interact with cutting-edge technologies (George, George, and Martin 2023). Dwivedi et al. (2023) review the relevant literature from experts in fields such as marketing, banking, and management, summarizing their views on the use of ChatGPT; they suggest that ChatGPT can offer significant benefits to financial institutions and promote business activities in these fields. In brief, there is a stream of literature on recent updates in technologies for processing textual information, such as the introduction of cutting-edge NLP algorithms, which provides insights into the discussions surrounding generative AI in the business and financial sectors.

Overall, the application of generative AI in financial research is still at an early stage, while researchers’ expertise and data input can significantly impact the output results of.

ChatGPT (e.g. Dowling and Lucey 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth 2022). The literature highlights the progress made by generative AI techniques such as GANs and ChatGPT and their potential as powerful tools for data scientists, offering benefits to financial institutions and increasing productivity in various fields, as well as the limitations of generative AI in financial studies.

Studies also highlight some potential concerns about job displacement and inequality that may arise as AI technology becomes more widespread, particularly in the context of developing countries. For instance, Lu and Zhou (2021) find that the productivity growth contributed by AI will lead to a redistribution of jobs and a restructuring of trade that will, at least in part, destroy jobs and often exacerbate inequalities within and between countries. Zhou et al. (2020) show that AI has a greater impact on the replacement of female, elderly, low-educated and low-income workers. It is also estimated that between 201 and 333 million workers in China will be replaced by AI by 2049.

With the rapid revolution in generative AI technologies, there is a need to update and discuss the emerging applications and challenges faced by researchers and industry practitioners. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature. While some research has explored the capabilities of generative AI models, such as GPT, in deciphering monetary policy decisions and determining the credibility of news outlets (e.g. Hansen and Kazinnik 2023; Yang and Menczer 2023), these studies have acknowledged the need for further exploration. We explore how slight variations in the input for generative AI tools can lead to significant changes in the output and also provide a countermeasure for controlling the stability of output when the altered content is imputed in a prompt template, and propose the research question for future study, especially for AI application in developing countries.

# 3. Prospects of generative AI in business and finance

Since generative AIs provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of natural language, businesses will gradually shift toward using them to capture, analyze, and leverage data. This section discusses several prospects for using generative AI tools in the business and finance sectors to provide customized services, risk management, and decision support. At the end of each subsection, we explore the capabilities of three widely used generative AI tools, ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard3 and examine how they can be used for personalized product recommendations, churn risk prediction, and financial sentiment analysis.

# 3.1 Customized service

Generative AI can provide automated customer service solutions that help businesses increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. For example, companies can use generative AI to understand customer needs, interact directly with customers, and customize marketing strategies. As George, George, and Martin (2023) point out that e-commerce companies can use automated chatbots to quickly respond to customer inquiries and improve user experience while saving costs. Generative AI can also enhance digital marketing campaigns, improving customer engagement and data collection. Financial institutions such as banks can use it as

a means for customers to log in, check their accounts, and obtain personal services without going to a local branch, whereas insurance companies can use it to evaluate claims more quickly. In the FinTech sector, generative AI may play a crucial role in digital advisory and can provide portfolio management services without significant human involvement. For financial institutions that lack data to train models or conduct stress tests, generative AI can generate synthetic data that comply with privacy protection regulations by learning patterns and relationships from actual data. Such synthetic datasets can achieve a certain level of similarity to the original data without compromising customer data privacy.

In this section, we use personalized product recommendations as an example of a customized service and ask ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard to provide answers to assess how accurately they understand human queries and provide insights. For this question, we set up a scenario in which the chatbot needs to select the plant for the customer best suited to summer flowering from a given set of three plants for which information is provided. The answers to these three generative AI tools are shown in Figure 1.

Given the answers from ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard, we can see they all can use the information given to identify the plant that is more suitable for summer, which suggests that the common-reasoning capability of these tools allows them to provide insights for customization. In contrast to ChatGPT 3.5, which offered extensive information about Lantana, ChatGPT 4 seemed to focus more on comparing different plants. By contrast, Bard analyzed why Lantana is more suitable for summer and provided a range of other plants for customers to choose from, which was not part of the information it was given.

# 3.2 Risk management

Generative AI has significant potential for producing human-like explanations of financial models and providing risk analyses. For instance, much textual information is generated during the lending decision process in credit risk management. Lenders can use generative AI to analyze loan textual assessments and provide extended information on whether to lend to a borrower. Future research could attempt to compare generative AI default predictions for crowdfunding with actual default risk based on disclosed information; generative AI could also be used to assess the quality culture of crowdfunding projects. Generative AI can also produce detailed loan applicant-friendly explanations for rejection, maintain good customer relationships, and improve future application processes. In the accounting and auditing domains, generative AI can automatically generate coherent, informative, and well-structured financial reports based on historical data, including balance sheets, income statements, and taxation documents. This process could significantly reduce the operational risks of manual errors. In addition, generative AI can produce synthetic cases of fraudulent transactions or activities for fraud detection that can help augment algorithms and more efficiently differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent patterns.

In this section, we use churn risk prediction as an example of risk management using a scenario where a customer leaves a very negative review on a shopping platform. We ask ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard to determine the churn risk (from ‘very high’, ‘high’,

This is a comment made by a customer on our company website. Please help me analyze the risk of churn for this customer. You can only choose answers from 'very high', 'high', 'normal', 'low', and 'very low'. Please do not include any further narrative.

Well, I have been buying clothes from your website for the previous five months, but now things are gradually becoming a disaster. A dress ordered a fortnight ago has not been shipped until today when the website shows it will be shipped within two days of the order being placed. Secondly, since last month, the dresses I have bought from your website have always had wrinkles in them, which I find very disappointing. I have decided never to buy clothes from your website again.

The risk of churn for this customer is high. The customer has been a loyal customer for 5 months but is now expressing dissatisfaction with the company's products and services. The customer has specifically mentioned that their dress was not shipped on time and that it arrived with wrinkles. These are both significant problems that could lead the customer to churn.

Here are some steps that the company could take to reduce the risk of churn:

- Apologize to the customer for the inconvenience and offer them a refund or replacement dress.
- Investigate the issue with the shipping delays and take steps to prevent them from happening again.
- Improve the quality control process to ensure that dresses are not shipped with wrinkles.

By taking these steps, the company can show the customer that they value their business and are committed to providing a high-quality shopping experience. This could help to prevent the customer from churning and encourage them to continue shopping with the company in the future.

Here are some additional factors that could contribute to the customer's churn risk:

- The customer's overall satisfaction with the company's products and services.
- The customer's perceived value of the company's products and services.
- The customer's cost of switching to a different company.

By understanding the factors that contribute to the customer's churn risk, the company can develop strategies to reduce the risk and improve customer retention.

# 3.3 Decision support

Another possible reason for the widespread use of generative AI is its support for a wide range of management and decision-making processes. The use of generative AI is significantly less costly in terms of money and time than traditional tools and produces more accurate and consistent content. For example, compared to institutional investors, who have better access to information and are more responsive to the market, individual investors, who usually lack professional analysis skills and face high default risk, may find generative AI tools capable of assisting them in selecting reliable investment projects. ChatGPT and Demir (2023) pointed out that generative AI can be used to analyze financial.

0.5. This is a negative sentiment, as the article mentions that Microsoft is inserting ads into AI experiments without providing an option to opt out of participation. This approach has already rankled some brands and risks further pushback from the industry.

Here are some of the key phrases in the article that contribute to the negative sentiment:

- irks some brands
- risks further pushback from the industry
- without providing an option to opt out of participation

Overall the article paints a negative picture of Microsoft's approach to AI search ads. This could have a negative impact on Microsoft's brand reputation and could lead to decreased advertiser confidence in the company's search products.

The generated sentiment scores can then be incorporated to predict stock returns and market trends. For institutions and individual investors interested in impact investing, generative AI can also generate Environmental, Social, and Corporate governance (ESG) scores or corporate culture-relevant indicators using texts from firms’ statements or speeches by managers.

In this section, we use financial sentiment analysis as an example of decision support to understand how generative AI tools can be used to generate numerical output. In this question, we provided ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard with a piece of news describing the insertion of advertisements by Google and Microsoft into their AI experiments. We asked the chatbots to provide a sentiment score ranging from 0 to 1 for the passage and the results are shown in Figure 3.

# B. CHEN ET AL.

Among the three generative AI tools, ChatGPT 4 again demonstrated robust text analysis and comprehension capabilities, producing a relatively reasonable result with a slightly negative sentiment score of 0.35. Although ChatGPT 3.5 generated a score of 0.5, indicating no positive or negative bias in sentiment, it did produce a value in the proper range from 0 to 1. Bard produced scores outside the values range but also other textual content.

In summary, we found that ChatGPT 4 performed significantly better than ChatGPT 3.5 and Bard regarding advanced reasoning capabilities, language understanding, and information interpretation. ChatGPT 4 has been developed using more training data, longer and updated information, and it can consider over one trillion parameters in its responses. In contrast, Bard differs from both ChatGPT models in that it is based on the PaLM2 model, and most of its training data originate from the Internet, which allows it to provide more information in its responses.

# 4. Case study

In this section, we use a case study to illustrate how generative AI tools can be used to understand firms’ risk perceptions regarding environmental policy and the resulting impact on financial markets. Hassan et al. (2019) show that firms’ political risks can be effectively captured using computational linguistic tools to analyze firms’ quarterly earnings conference calls. Captured political risks are correlated with firms’ actions and stock market volatility. Inspired by Hassan et al. (2019), this section provides an empirical example using ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT 3.5, which have been found to outperform Bard in Section 3, to capture firms’ attitudes towards implementing California’s cap-and-trade program. Based on unstructured textual information, ChatGPT can assist investors in optimizing their investment portfolios.

California’s cap-and-trade program gained final approval from the California Air Resources Board on 20 October 2011. This marked the official adoption of the program, designed to reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions and help the state meet its ambitious climate change targets. The cap-and-trade program went into effect on 1 January 2013, and has become a cornerstone of California’s efforts to address climate change.

Our sample includes 321 listed companies in mining, utilities, construction, and manufacturing (North American Industry Classification System two-digit codes 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, and 33) headquartered in California and three neighboring states: Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona. We searched two keywords, ‘cap and trade’ and ‘cap-and-trade’, in the annual reports following the approval of the cap-and-trade policy in 2011 and entered the searched text into ChatGPT. The detailed prompt template used in this study is: ‘On a probability scale of 0 to 1, what is the negative sentiment score of the discussion for cap-and-trade policy in the provided text:’ + ‘searched text’ + ‘Please only output the sentiment score without any narrative nor analysis. So the sentiment score of this text is: ___’.

Below, we present one typical extract entered into ChatGPT:

‘On a probability scale of 0 to 1, what is the negative sentiment score of the discussion for cap-and-trade policy in the provided text: In 2009, the US House of Representatives approved legislation that seeks to establish a cap and trade system for GHG emissions. However, the US Senate did not act, and it is uncertain whether a cap and trade system will move forward in

The sentiment score of this text is: 0.2.

Consequently, ChatGPT generated a corresponding sentiment score on the state’s cap-and-trade policy, which measures the level of negativity companies have towards the cap-and-trade program. We use the sentiment score from ChatGPT 4 as the main score, while the sentiment score from ChatGPT 3.5 is used as a supplemental score. We also opt for the Spearman Rank definition of correlation as it is non-parametric and allows us to gain insights into whether the ordering of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 generated sentiment scores has fundamentally changed (Stevenson, Mues, and Bravo 2021). The correlation coefficient is 0.970, indicating a high correlation between both sentiment scores. We obtained company financial information from Compustat for the period 2008–2017.

In Table 1, R&D is the ratio of firms’ R&D expenditures scaled by total assets. Leverage is the ratio of total debt to total assets. Cap-trade is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the observation is in 2013 or later and 0 otherwise. Mention is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the annual report mentions the keywords ‘cap-and-trade’ or ‘cap and trade’ in 2011 and 0 otherwise. Sentiment 4 and Sentiment 3.5 are sentiment scores generated by ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT 3.5 based on analyzing sentences in companies’ annual reports related to cap-and-trade policies. Higher scores indicate more negative company sentiment towards the cap-and-trade policy. We controlled for the one-year lagged value of firm size (Ln total assets), the cash holdings ratio (cash holdings/total assets), and the ROA ratio. Our model included firm fixed effects.

The results show that firms mentioning keywords increased their R&D ratios by 8.3% and reduced their leverage ratios by 55.3% after the cap-and-trade program compared with firms that did not mention these keywords. This result is consistent with real options theory (Dixit, Dixit, and Pindyck 1994) that uncertainty in the external environment tends to discourage firms from making long-term investments. Further analysis showed that

|Not mentioned|252|−0.12|2.04|−5.07|22.28|

This table shows the summary statistics of the average daily returns (%) of the three groups of firms in 2013. We obtained daily stock prices from the CRSP. The sample contains stocks in the mining and utilities industries, whose headquarters are in California. The stocks are divided into three groups based on the sentiment scores generated by ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT 3.5: high sentiment, low sentiment, and not mentioned.

Firms with a higher negative sentiment score in the relevant text significantly improved their inputs and further reduced their leverage ratio (see Table 1). This result suggests that firms may reduce emissions by increasing R&D investment in cleaner technology and production equipment and reducing leverage to reduce the risk of financial distress in the face of stricter environmental regulations. This result is consistent with Nguyen and Phan’s (2020) findings that increased carbon risk leads to higher financial distress risk, which motivates firms to reduce their financial leverage. In terms of the difference between the estimates of Sentiment 4 and Sentiment 3.5, we find that the statistical significance of the two estimates is similar, and the estimate of Sentiment 4 on the leverage ratio of companies has a lower p-value than that of Sentiment 3.5. It suggests that the sentiment captured by ChatGPT 4 is a better predictor of firms’ leverage. This finding is consistent with our conclusion in Section 3 that ChatGPT 4 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 in language understanding and information interpretation.

In Table 2, the results show that firms with higher negative sentiment scores have lower values in daily firm returns, with a mean of 0.06 (based on the scores from ChatGPT4), compared to firms with lower negative sentiment scores (mean of 0.14). By contrast, the non-mentioned firms have the lowest values (mean of −0.12) and higher fluctuations (standard deviation of 2.04), consistent with the above findings regarding reducing firms’ leverage ratios. This result suggests that unlike firms with high sentiment scores, which have perceived unfavorable consequences of the stringent policy, the non-mentioned firms had not taken countermeasures, such as developing green technology (Fischer and Newell 2008; Hamamoto 2006; Johnstone, Haščič, and Popp 2010). Investments in these non-mentioned firms are likely to exhibit lower and more volatile returns.

In this section, we demonstrated the ability of ChatGPT to perform sentiment analysis in the financial market. After introducing an environmental policy, the negative sentiment of companies captured by ChatGPT predicted better risk management capabilities and less volatile stock performance. The negative sentiment generated by ChatGPT can effectively indicate risk factors, allowing investors to manage their portfolios strategically.

# 5. Ethical concerns, limitations and regulation

Despite the increasing use and great potential of generative AI, certain concerns, limitations, and challenges in its application require more attention.
---
# JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES

# 5.1 Ethical concerns

Data protection is one of the significant challenges associated with generative AI. Generative AI users may provide private information when using personalized services, making them vulnerable to data breaches. For example, when banks use generative AI to analyze customer information, they may need to handle many sensitive personal information, potentially threatening customer privacy if mishandled. This could, in turn, affect the bank’s reputation and customer satisfaction. Second, due to a lack of legislation, it is difficult to attribute responsibility for errors or violations caused by generative AI. For example, if the decisions or services of a firm supported by generative AI violate the law, who should be held legally responsible? Unlike humans, chatbots do not have a legal personality (Beerbaum 2023) under the current legal and regulatory framework. Third, generative AI tools threaten labour markets (Eisfeldt, Schubert, and Zhang 2023), especially in developing counties (Zhou et al. 2020). It is foreseeable that many simple and repetitive tasks will soon be performed using AI rather than humans. In particular, chatbot apps and other AI tools will likely replace many female-dominated occupations, such as customer service roles. However, this societal transformation will increase the demand for highly skilled workers to deploy and develop AI technologies (Ali 2023). The resulting unemployment, widening income inequality, and gender gaps may exacerbate social instability. Developing countries, which are more likely to suffer from the consequent inequalities, should consider the trade-offs between the opportunities and risks posed by emerging AI technologies and use their institutional characteristics to pursue not only industrial catch-up but also the social benefits of emerging technologies (Gherhes et al. 2023). Another issue is the increased energy consumption caused by training large datasets for ChatGPT (An, Ding, and Lin 2023), which can accelerate environmental degradation and the inefficient use of resources. Therefore, research into renewable and sustainable energy-efficient training methods is required.

# 5.2 Limitations

We caution that some limitations of the use of generative AI in academia and industry should be considered. For example, generative AI can produce unusual and illogical responses such as fictitious references (Thorp 2023) and unintentionally biased output for users (ChatGpt and Demir 2023). In the financial sector, false data generated by generative AI can lead to problematic model training, mislead decision-makers, and trigger huge losses. The inability to identify the possible illicit objectives of AI users can accelerate the spread of false information by unscrupulous individuals using ChatGPT influences investor sentiment and decisions, increases market uncertainty, and heightens volatility. Mann et al. (2023) suggest that fake output from LLMs should be deleted promptly. In addition, when analyzing and predicting company financial and industry data, it should be noted that generative AI predictions and recommendations are based on historical data and cannot predict unexpected events. Therefore, excessive reliance on generative AI-automated forecasts and recommendations may lead to unwise investment decisions, and investors may suffer significant losses.
---
# 5.3 Regulations

Moral and legal concerns regarding the use of generative AI necessitate regulations in the financial sector, as discussed in Section 5.1. We asked Microsoft Bing’s chatbot about the ongoing development of a regulatory framework for generative AI. There is no legislation specifically designed to regulate the use of generative AI, except for the AI Act being finalized by the European Union. The proposed legislation focuses primarily on strengthening rules surrounding data quality, transparency, human oversight, and accountability.

The second limitation is that generative AI is sensitive to changes in the prompt template. Replies to questions that have the same meaning but are phrased differently can be quite varying. Worse still, the same content entered in different generative AI chats can produce distinct results. People should be particularly cautious when using generative AI to create numerical features. We provide some cases to illustrate this drawback. In Figure 4, we asked ChatGPT 3.57 to generate text readability scores for financial news published by Reuters on 10 June 2023. The scores were set to a range of 0 to 1, with 0 indicating the lowest level of the text readability. We find that ChatGPT 3.5 generated different outputs based on the same inputs, which is caused by the access to different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) between different ChatGPT chat boxes. It is therefore essential to apply appropriate strategies to overcome the sensitivity of the prompt.

We then tried setting the ‘temperature’ of generated readability score equal to 0, which resulted in more consistent numerical outputs. Using the ‘temperature’ (randomness) setting for generated content may be preferable when the user needs to generate a specific number. For users who pose an open-ended question, such as a request for a comment, it would be better to use a setting that allows a wider range of creative responses. Using an API is another way of modifying the creativity and stability of generated content, but it requires programming skills and fees for use.

Third, although challenging, it is important to use generative AI efficiently. For example, ChatGPT, the most widely used generative AI today, can only provide 25 answers in three hours, which would not meet the demands of many financial institutions. Meanwhile, only a few users can access ChatGPT plugins, which may limit the Internet community’s ability to develop more AI applications (OpenAI 2023b). Furthermore, unlike New Bing, which is available to people worldwide, OpenAI is not available in certain regions, such as Saudi Arabia and China. Addressing these limitations requires efforts to improve the efficiency of AI systems, increase their accessibility, and promote equitable access to AI technology. Failing to do so could impede the diffusion of knowledge and exacerbate inequalities in the distribution of intellectual resources across countries. An example of the current bias in generative AI is that ChatGPT is better at understanding content written in English than text in other languages (Seghier, 2023). Recognizing and mitigating bias in generative AI systems is essential for ensuring fair and inclusive outcomes. Finally, given the rationality of machines (Constantinescu et al. 2022), it is unlikely that generative AI will make suggestions with loving care, especially given the prevalence of harmful gender stereotypes. This limitation needs to be considered when using generative AI for human interactions or sensitive matters.

When “temperature” was controlled, the generated scores were more consistent with variation only after one decimal place.

(see Figure 6). Considering the above concerns regarding the use of generative AI and the current lack of discipline, we offer some insights into the future design of regulatory frameworks to guide the use of generative AI.

The government should consider the current trends in the development of generative AI when designing laws and regulations to prevent unauthorized access. A corresponding improvement in the legal system for using AI techniques is essential not only for the business and finance sectors but also for other institutional users or individuals who may suffer from data breaches (ChatGpt and Demir 2023). To mitigate the risks of these concerns, Open AI introduced the Bug Bounty Program, which aims to improve data security (OpenAI 2023a). Nevertheless, more efforts should be made to establish regulatory frameworks and create technologies to protect privacy and prevent the spread of false or biased information from generative AI. Policymakers should also consider other ways to prepare people for future AI developments, such as how to offset the negative effects of generative AI on employment and inequality. In addition, as the sole license holder of GPT-3, Microsoft has the monopolistic power to control generative AI tools (Dis, Bollen, and Zuidema 2023; Hao 2020). This situation calls for government action to lower the entry barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises and promote healthy competition in an ideal business environment.

Please list laws and regulations announced by governments around the world to govern the use of generative AI.

Governments around the world are jostling to take the lead on regulating AI systems. However, there is currently no legislation specifically designed to regulate the use of AI. Rather, AI systems are regulated by other existing regulations such as data protection, consumer protection, and market competition laws. The European Union has unveiled strict regulations to govern the use of artificial intelligence and is finalizing the AI Act, a sweeping regulation that aims to regulate the most "high-risk" usages of AI systems in sectors such as health care and education.

Tell me more about the EU's AI Act:

The AI Act is a regulation proposed by the European Commission that aims to introduce a common regulatory and legal framework for artificial intelligence, encompassing all sectors (except for military) and all types of artificial intelligence. The proposed legislation focuses primarily on strengthening rules around data quality, transparency, human oversight, and accountability.

The AI Act will be the world's first comprehensive AI law and will regulate the use of artificial intelligence in the EU according to the risk they pose to users. The different risk levels will mean more or less regulation. AI systems with an unacceptable level of risk to people's safety would be strictly prohibited, including systems that deploy subliminal or purposefully manipulative techniques, exploit people's vulnerabilities, or are used for social scoring.

Figure 6. Current development of regulatory frameworks for the use of generative AI.

In academia, preventing students from using generative AI tools to write assignments is one of higher education’s biggest challenges. In one study, only 63% of the abstracts generated by ChatGPT were caught (Thorp 2023). Thus, there is an urgent need to establish regulations and develop detection techniques to prevent academic misconduct caused by generative AI effectively. Liebrenz et al. (2023) recommend establishing guidelines, plagiarism checks, and publication ethics for AI-generated content to protect authorship. To work towards responsible AI, practitioners can refer to a conceptual framework, the Five Ps, proposed by Nabavi and Browne (2023). Higher education institutions can implement this framework to maintain the credibility and integrity of their academic assessments and promote ethical AI use among students.

The challenges posed by generative AI, which include data protection and privacy, legal liability, impact on the labour market and social stability, and environmental concerns, require multidisciplinary and responsible solutions involving technical developments, legal frameworks, and societal collaboration between researchers, policymakers, industrial experts, and users.

# 6. Conclusion

The use of generative AI in business and finance can provide many benefits, including ease of access, cost savings, and improved efficiency. AI use is expected to become more widespread in the coming years. ChatGPT, an example of a powerful language-model-based chatbot, has been widely used to handle complex tasks in industry and academia; however, its capabilities are largely underexplored.

This article reviews recent studies in economics and finance, summarizes relevant applications of generative AI in industries and academia, and shows examples of using the latest generative AI tools, including ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, and Bard, to conduct analysis. Most importantly, we empirically evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to perform sentiment scoring for firms in the context of policy implementation. Using generative AI to analyze firms’ public statements can give financial market participants valuable insights into their perceived risks to their external environments. Section 4 shows that sentiment scores predict firms’ stock returns and performance. This information can help investors understand uncertainty and make informed decisions. By exploring the ability of ChatGPT to transform unstructured data into a coherent and easily understandable format, we demonstrated the great potential of generative AI in improving the efficiency of financial markets. Simultaneously, we note several challenges and limitations associated with adopting generative AI in business and finance, such as data security and the lack of regulations to discipline applications in industry and academia. In this regard, it is crucial to be aware of technical limitations, develop relevant regulatory frameworks, and ensure that chatbot outputs are compliant. We note that governments, especially those of developing countries, should pay attention to relevant challenges for their employment and equality. On the other hand, it is crucial to maximize the potential of generative AI to enable financial services and products for underserved populations, thereby promoting financial inclusion.

We hope this study will inspire further research and innovation in the field of generative AI. To that end, we suggest several research questions for further study:

1. Can generative AI improve performance in predicting stock prices, and do some generative AI tools perform better than others?
2. Are measures of corporate culture or ESG scores produced by generative AI through textual analysis consistent with or even superior to existing measures?
3. Can generative AI be used to detect discrimination, unfairness (e.g. gender or ethnic bias), or fraud in financial markets?
4. Can generative AI capture companies’ attitudes towards social issues, such as climate change or the Black Lives Matter movement, and further explore the determinants or consequences of these attitudes?
5. What guidance can scholars provide to help financial market regulators develop a legal framework for the emergence and development of generative AI?
6. Given the opportunities and challenges of generative AI to developing countries, how can AI better support small businesses and households in these regions to promote inclusion and equality?
7. Another aspect missing from recent theoretical modelling work is the international dimension of the AI revolution. This includes how AI triggers a new round of cross-border technological and economic competition through government investment strategies, how it affects the structure of international trade, and how it changes the global value chain. These issues offer economists a wide field for future discussion and research.

# 1. Introduction

Climate change and sustainability have drawn broad attention internationally. World leaders have found a general consensus on this issue, as stated in the 2015 Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While member countries have agreed to work cooperatively to mitigate the severe problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, one of the major challenges is the financing mitigation and adaptation action to climate change and sustainability. Significant amount of investment is needed for solving the problem. Maintaining the 2° C temperature threshold of the Paris Agreement requires $53 trillion in energy-related investments by 2035 (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2014).

Ji and Zhang (2019) document that financial development is a critical determinant for the further progress of China’s renewable energy sector. In 2010, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established by 194 countries, aiming to provide financial support to developing countries to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. Since then, the term “green finance” has frequently appeared in reports of international organizations (see for example, IFC, 2017) and national governments. Relevant discussions have also attracted enormous attention from academics. Green finance per se, however, remains vaguely defined and is often mixed with climate finance.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

It is often hard to distinguish between green finance and climate finance. According to IFC (2017), green finance is defined as “financing of investments that provide environmental benefits”, whereas the latter is proposed and defined by UNFCCC as “local, national or transnational financing-drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing-that seeks to support mitigation and adaption actions that will address climate change”.

Though subtly different in definitions, at the heart of both terms is the financing tools for coping with climate change and others for sustainability.1

Green finance clearly has paramount policy importance, reflected by the intensive discussions among international organizations and national governments since its emergence. It has also led to increasing interest among academic researchers. Zhang (2018), for example, emphasizes the importance of carbon finance within the general framework of green finance.

This paper starts from summarizing recent literature, aiming to first draw a big picture of relevant academic research. By learning from the current status, we hope to form a proper understanding of the conceptual issues, and more importantly, to identify development trends and provide useful guidance on future research directions in this important and developing subject.

# 2. Methodology and basic setups

The method used in this paper is a bibliometric analysis approach. It was first used by Pritchard (1969) and has gained wide popularity to aid quantitative analysis in understanding the literature. We use CiteSpace, a software developed by Chen (2006), to show visualizing patterns of the previous studies on green finance. Given the fact that a clear conceptual definition of green finance is lacking, we

1 We thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the issue of which term is a better choice “green finance” and “climate finance”. Green finance (as in IFC, 2017) will be used to emphasize global concerns on environmental issues but we do want to clarify that this term is broadly defined and thus indicating no differences to climate finance.

concentrate on three aforementioned keywords search, namely, green finance, climate finance and carbon finance. We also include a number of keywords with small variations to increase the coverage of relevant literature, which are green financing, climate financing, carbon financing, green investment, and green bond.

For the retaining the general information and ease of search, we impose several restrictions on identifying relevant researches. First, all candidate papers should be in the Web of Science core collection. Second, papers should be Articles indexed in one of the following indices: Science citation index-expanded (SCIE), Social science citation index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities citation index (A&HCI), and Emerging source citation index (ESCI). Effective samples cover the range from 2001 to 2018. Third, we manually go through all titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant articles.

In total, 381 papers have been included in our sample. The number of papers published in each year is plotted in figure 1. A clear upward trend of publications can be spotted during the sample period. Noticeably, as opposed to the slow and steady growth trend before 2015, the number of relevant publications has increased sharply since 2015, which implies substantially increased interests from academics on green finance since the 2015 Paris Agreement.

(Insert Figure 1 here)

# 3. Key results

Our bibliometric analysis will focus on four main areas and aim to answer the following questions:

- Which journals are these paper published?
- Where are the authors from (countries of origin)?
- What are the key interests (keywords analysis) of these studies?
- How are these paper cited in the literature?

Page 6 of 20

# 3.1 Journal distribution

Table 1 reports a list of journals according to their numbers of publications (of more than four relevant papers per journal) in our sample. Clearly, although finance is defined as a key element of green finance, the main journals publishing related works turn out to be those who concentrate on environmental and climate change. Not even one finance journal made to the list. In fact, by examining the list of papers published in finance journals, we did find some relevant ones, namely, one from Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis (Heinkel et al., 2001), two from International Review of Financial Analysis (Bredin et al., 2014; Turner, 2012), two from Emerging Market Finance and Trade (He and Liu, 2018; Celik and Binatli, 2018), and one from Finance Research Letters (Febi et al., 2018). Although the first paper in this collection is from a top finance journal, evidence here confirms what Diaz-Rainey et al. (2017) conclude, that the main stream finance journals are generally silent on the climate change issue.

Three key economics journals appearing in this list are Ecological Economics, Energy Economics and Environmental & Resource Economics, which are all field journals of environmental and resource economics. It is not hard to notice that green finance is yet to become the interest of mainstream economics or finance journals, despite its widely acknowledged importance and an urgent need of full-fledged policy and regulatory tools. Much remains to be done to bring this fast developing topic into the spotlight of mainstream economic and finance research, and to fill the wide gap existing in extant literature.

(Insert Table 1 here)

Two reasons exist to support our claims here. First, the amount of investment in

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Green/climate projects have increased substantially and maintained a strong growth momentum in the recent years. For example, global green bond issuance had a historical record of 155.5 billion US dollars in 20172, creating high demand for academic research in this area; Second, more people are interested in this area with increasing research outputs by a broader categories of academic researchers. Although it is a bit too early to see more publications now, a number of events associated with main stream finance journals in the last couple of years will surely link to relevant outputs (e.g. 2018 RFS Climate Finance Initiative in London3). Lacking of relevant research also means potentially high impact with ground-breaking research in this area. Overall, we are very positive to make the claim that an opportunity exists.

# 3.2 Authors’ country of origin

It is also worth exploring where the keenness on green finance research mainly comes from. We look at this issue by linking it to the authors’ countries of origin. Figure 2 summarizes the information of country of origin of the authors. It depicts a clear picture showing that the main contributors to the recent fast progress of this field are mainly from the US, Europe and a few other developed countries. It is not surprising to see the dominance of US-based researchers in this field, as the World Bank, UN and many other most influential international organizations have their headquarters based in the US, which can much facilitate and encourage relevant research. For years, Europe has been the most enthusiastic promoter of global cooperation on climate change. Its world’s largest carbon trading market (EU ETS) with a long history has attracted substantial attentions from academic researchers.

on green energy issues. The color in the figure also demonstrates time dimension. The lighter the color is, the earlier the work appears. It is observed that this subject is piloted and led by researchers from the US and England, while the majority of studies from other regions follow up and appear later.

(Insert Figure 2 here)

Among all visible contributors’ origins in the graph, China and India are the only two emerging economies. Considering the sizes of these two countries and their shares of global GHG emissions, it is very important to have China and India actively participating in the debates. The unbalanced distribution between developed and developing countries of origin may also imply that developed countries remain dominating on green finance topics. In the international negotiations on climate agreements, developing countries have been playing an increasingly important role. This is argued to be one of the main reasons that a universal agreement is difficult to reach (Costantini et al., 2016).

Although developed countries are mainly the source of financing, without active cooperation from developing countries, it is hard to achieve efficient green financing or investment. Further investigations and understanding on developing economies and their status quo are very necessary.

Of course, we have to acknowledge that academic research has been dominated by developed economies and author structure is unlikely to change much in a short period of time. Issues in developing countries however, should be one of the main future directions of research.

# 3.3 Keywords analysis

Table 2 lists the top ten keywords. Climate Finance, Climate Change and Policy are the top three main.

concerns in the literature. The objective of developing green finance is to cope with climate change and this is clearly a policy relevant question.

(Insert Table 2 here)

Figure 3 provides a graphical illustration of keywords appearing in these articles. The graphical information combined with the world top ten list reveals some interesting patterns. In addition to the core issues, a number of keywords are shown to have attracted much attention. For example, Management is ranked the 10th, which reflects the concerns on how green finance is managed by a state or in a market. Another relevant keyword (Governance) also visible in Figure 3 is related to management, indicating that proper governing is an important concern to green finance. Researchers are also interested in Impact, or how much green finance may affect sustainability and development (Growth). China is the key player of green finance and thus is unsurprisingly an important research focus. Market, Finance and Investment fail to make to the top ten list, but they are clearly visible in Figure 3, implying the needs to study green finance topics from finance aspects.

(Insert Figure 3 here)

Keywords analysis conveys important information that can be used to clarify the conceptual points of green finance. It is obvious that green finance is related to climate change and should be policy driven. Issues of financing or investment on climate adaption are the key subject of interests. Green finance is not only relevant to environmental economists or scientists, but also requires contribution from economists and financial economists.

# 3.4 Citation analysis

Page 10 of 20

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Papers on green finance are generally well cited. The average number of citations for the sample composed of 381 papers is 8.54. The highest citation number is 183 on Heinkel et al. (2001). Table 3 reports the top ten most cited papers in our sample. These ten papers come from very widely ranged sources, which indicates once again the interdisciplinary nature of this subject.

(Insert Table 3 here)

We also investigate the source of references cited by these 381 papers. It is plotted in Figure 4. Clearly it is dominated by science, climate change and environmental journals. Though a few economics journals (for example, American Economic Review, Ecological Economics) are shown to affect these researches, it is obvious that finance journals are hardly involved. Citation analysis for cited journals also indicates how the relevant literature network is developed. Once again, although this area bears the name of green finance, its current studies are rarely based on main stream finance journals. It also indicates a clear need to introduce techniques and models in main stream finance research to study green finance issues.

# 4. Conclusion

This paper utilizes a simple bibliometric approach to analyze the current status and trend of development of academic research on the subject of green finance. Through ranking analysis and visualized illustration on a number of key factors of a sample of 381 relevant publications, we find important information that can help us form an accurate picture of this subject matter. Based on keywords analysis of the literature, green finance needs to be considered an interdisciplinary research.

topic that encompasses and deals with policies, investment and governance on financing and investment in climate adaption. As the authors’ country of origin analysis reveals, green finance researches are currently dominated by scholars from developed economies. Papers in this area are mainly published by policy journals or journals focusing on environmental/climate changes, while scarcely seen in mainstream economics or finance journals.

Green finance has shown its great importance and fast growing relevance. With increasing interests in recent literature but a lack of attention from mainstream economics and finance journals, it has created a gap that gives opportunities to researchers in at least three directions for future developments. First, given that green finance is essentially a matter of finance, there is urgent need to study green finance issues from finance perspectives and using techniques from finance. Topics such as green bonds, green risk management and green governance should be of interests in mainstream finance journals. Second, more studies on green finance issues from developing countries’ perspectives would be useful to regulators and policy makers to align different policy goals and develop well-defined policy objectives. With clear information advantages, scholars from developing countries will be given more chances, and more international collaboration between developing and developed countries are expected. Third, it is worth mentioning that a remarkable difference between green finance and standard finance topics is that the former is essentially policy driven. New issues in this field are thus likely to emerge with the rapidly changing international economic and political environments. Moreover, to our best knowledge, a comprehensive review of relevant literature is still not available. It is definitely worth to explore and make comparison to the results of our bibliometric analysis.

# A Meta-Analytic Review of Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Financial Performance: The Moderating Effect of Contextual Factors

# Qian Wang, Junsheng Dou, and Shenghua Jia

# Abstract

The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has long been a central and contentious debate in the literature. However, prior empirical studies provide indefinite conclusions. The purpose of this study is to review systematically and quantify the CSR–CFP link in a meta-analytic framework. Based on 119 effect sizes from 42 studies, this study estimates that the overall effect size of the CSR–CFP relationship is positive and significant, thus endorsing the argument that CSR does enhance financial performance. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the causal relationship between CSR and CFP. Subsequent financial performance is associated with prior social responsibility, while the reverse direction is not supported. This finding supports the instrumental stakeholder theory. As predicted, the meta-analysis results indicate that the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP explain some variations of the CSR–CFP relationship. Last, this study examines the moderating effect of the environmental context on the CSR–CFP link.

work proposes that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The results show that the CSR–CFP relationship is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.

# Corporate social responsibility (CSR)

has been a subject of great interest for more than 30 years among scholars from multiple management perspectives, including cost perspective, agency theory, instrumental stakeholder theory, resource-based view (RBV), and reputation theory (Friedman, 1970; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; Muller & Kraussl, 2011). The existing empirical literature has largely focused on the precise nature of the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP; Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003; Ullmann, 1985). Since Bragdon and Marlin (1972) and Moskowitz (1972) published the first studies (Margolis & Walsh, 2003), more than 100 studies have empirically examined the relationship between CSR and CFP. However, the inconsistent findings for the linkage between CSR and CFP are still far from clear (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Ullmann, 1985; Waddock & Graves, 1997). Some studies suggest that being socially responsible does increase a firm’s performance (Lev, Petrovits, & Radhakrishnan, 2010; Surroca, Tribo, & Waddock, 2010); other studies suggest that it does not (Aupperle et al., 1985; Graves & Waddock, 2000). Moreover, recent empirical studies have explored nonlinear relationships and have argued that CSR cannot universally produce favorable returns for all firms all the time (Brammer & Millington, 2008; H. Wang, Choi, & Li, 2008).

Researchers have identified a number of reasons for the failure to reach a consensus on the implications of improved social performance for financial performance. At the theoretical level, there is concern about stakeholder mismatching (Wood & Jones, 1995), theoretical shortcomings and inadequate definitions of key terms (Ullmann, 1985), “the conceptual determinants of CSR, and consequently the theoretical expectations of the CSR-CFP relationships” (Brammer & Millington, 2008, p. 1326), and the boundaries of CSR (Barnett, 2007). At the same time, a variety of operational shortcomings are also attributed to the mixed findings, such as operationalization and methodological differences in the definitions of social and financial performance.

Wang et al. - 3

(Griffin & Mahon, 1997): failure to control some other important variables that have been thought to have direct influence on firm performance, such as risk, industry affiliation, asset, age (Cochran & Wood, 1984), investment in research and development (R&D), and advertising expenditure (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).

To figure out this inconsistent relationship, some scholars have used the method of meta-analysis to investigate the CSR–CFP linkage (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Although these previous meta-analyses on CSR–CFP linkage have examined a variety of theoretical and methodology shortcomings mentioned above, to date there has been little meta-analysis focus on the moderating effects of contextual factors that can explain the heterogeneity of the CSR–CFP linkage. Given that the empirical research on CSR has provided evidence suggesting that contingency factors, such as the level of dynamism in firms’ operational environment and industrial characteristics, may be the important factors in understanding the inconclusive results (H. Wang et al., 2008), it is surprising that the extant meta-analyses on CSR have not examined the moderating effects of the contextual contingency on the relationship between CSR and CFP. The present study seeks to fill this void in the CSR literature.

Moreover, dramatic changes have occurred in the global economy over the past several decades. Emerging economies, such as China and India, have realized a fast integration into the global economic system. But there is still a significant gap in the market development and institutional environment between developing and developed economies. Such market and institutional variations in the cross-national context may moderate the degree to which CSR can contribute to the bottom line. The authors argue here that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The authors would, therefore, expect more financial performance to be gained in developed countries than in developing countries. In recent studies, some scholars have appealed for more attention to the cross-national comparison (Campbell, 2007). But due to the shortage of multinational data, the comparative research based on different backgrounds is still rare. This article intends to fill the essential research gap that exists among CSR studies. The meta-analysis applied in this study can overcome these issues to a certain extent by integrating empirical results across diverse contexts.

The present study seeks to extend the CSR literature by addressing the moderating effect of contingency factors. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 42 studies published from 2003 to 2012 to get a statistically aggregated result of the CSR–CFP relationship. Orlitzky et al. (2003) tested the linkage of CSR and CFP through a meta-analysis of 52 studies from 1970 to

2002, so the authors of this study searched for papers published during or after the year of 2003. In this study, the authors assume that the measurement strategy and environmental context may explain the heterogeneity of the CSR–CFP linkage. The intended objectives of this article are fourfold: (a) to provide a general relationship between CSR and CFP from accumulated research, (b) to investigate the direction of causality between CSR and CFP, (c) to examine the moderating effect of the operationalization of CSR and CFP on this linkage, and (d) to assess the moderating effect of contingency factors.

The reminder of the article comprises five additional sections. The “Theory and Hypotheses” section reviews the literature on the linkage between CSR and CFP. The role of measurement strategy and environmental context on this relationship are particularly highlighted, and with this review, the research hypotheses are proposed. The “Method” section describes the methodological approach and data for this study. The “Results” section presents the empirical results, whereas the “Discussion” section discusses and outlines the study’s contributions and implications, as well as some limitations, and suggests avenues for further research. The “Conclusion” section summarizes and concludes.

# Theory and Hypotheses

# The CSR–CFP Linkage

CSR–CFP-negative-association. Those researchers arguing for a negative relationship between social and financial performance believe that firms that perform responsibly are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their unresponsive peers (Aupperle et al., 1985), because they impose a direct cost on the firm (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Ullmann, 1985). This point of view is mainly supported by neoclassical economic theory.

Another dominant critique of business social involvement originates from the principal–agent paradigm, which suggests that the purpose of the firm is primarily for the profit of the stockholders. Friedman (1970), the well-known critic of CSR, supposed that in responding to calls for socially responsible practices, executives take money and resources that otherwise go to stockholders and dedicate those resources to enhance their personal benefits. According to agency theory, the agents (the top management team) and the principals (the shareholders) always show a conflict of interests and objectives. Therefore, managers may act in their own best interests, but at the expense of the firm’s owners. As a result, the costs involved in agency relationships may be high and damage corporate value.

# Wang et al.

Although the enterprises may bear the direct cost and agency cost of social responsibility, they can also obtain benefits from CSR. In fact, both the academic and practical worlds have expressed more and more doubts about the point of maximization of shareholder wealth held by neoclassical economists. Recently, frequently exposed corporate scandals have gradually given rise to a wave of rethink and debate on the role of the firm to society. Especially following the global financial crisis, public concern, regulatory forces, media interest, reputation pursuit, consumer pressure, and intraindustry peer pressure have led to the prevalence of CSR on firms’ top management agendas. Actually, the value of a firm depends on the cost not only of explicit claims from shareholders but also of implicit claims from other stakeholders (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988). Besides stockholders and bondholders, other stakeholders also have implicit contracts. If corporate management fails to respond to these implicit claims, parties to implicit contracts may attempt to transform these implicit agreements into explicit agreements that will, as a result, be more costly.

# CSR–CFP-positive-association

Instrumental stakeholder theory, an important strand within stakeholder theory, supports the positive association between CSR and CFP. This theory suggests that firms view their stakeholders as part of an environment that must be managed to assure revenues, profits, and, ultimately, returns to shareholders (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999). Attention to stakeholder concerns may help a firm avoid decisions that might prompt stakeholders to undercut or thwart its objectives. This possibility arises because it is the stakeholders who control resources that can facilitate or enhance the implementation of corporate decisions (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). It has been demonstrated that employees show greater commitment to a firm that has a good public image in supplying human capital (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994). Moreover, such firms are often perceived as an attractive employer by job seekers (Backhaus, Stone, & Heiner, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000). Customers may respond to positive social performance by increasing their demand for the firm’s products or services, or by paying premium prices (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2003). Furthermore, some investors, particularly certain institutional ones, are more willing to invest in firms known for pursuing CSR (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Graves & Waddock, 1994; Johnson & Greening, 1999).

Others have augmented stakeholder theory with aspects of RBV (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). Drawing upon the RBV, researchers claim that by developing close relationships with primary stakeholders, a firm can develop certain intangible resources such as innovation (Klassen & Whybark, 1999), human resources (Russo & Harrison, 2005), and organizational culture (Howard-Grenville, Hoffman, & Wirtenberg, 2003), which enable the most efficient and competitive.

# Business & Society

use of the firm’s assets and help it acquire a competitive advantage over its rivals (Surroca et al., 2010). CSR can function as a means for firms to secure the acquisition of critical resources controlled by stakeholders (H. Wang et al., 2008) and help firms to reduce the risk of losing resources they already control (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Brammer & Millington, 2004; Godfrey, 2005).

Strategy scholars have recently developed a construct of “moral reputation capital” that links CSR activities to shareholder value from the corporate reputation theory (Godfrey, 2005; Godfrey et al., 2009; Muller & Kraussl, 2011). The “insurance” perspective suggests that firms with strong reputations for CSR will be able to preserve firm value in times of crises better than firms with weak reputations for CSR (Godfrey et al., 2009; Schnietz & Epstein, 2005). When negative events occur, stakeholders will respond based on both the negative effects of the act and the perceived state of mind and intentions of the offender (Godfrey et al., 2009). Godfrey et al. (2009) argued that moral reputation capital derived from CSR would reduce the overall severity of sanctions, but firms with no CSR activity lack this form of buffering goodwill and stand exposed to potentially greater impacts.

So far the discussion suggests that the actual relationship between CSR and financial performance is generally positive from stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory formulations.

Despite a long and contentious debate about the theory of CSR business case, the majority of results from prior empirical studies and meta-analyses have pointed to a positive relationship between CSR and CFP. Among the 109 published studies from 1972 to 2002 collected by Margolis and Walsh (2003), almost half of the studies (54) reported a positive relationship, only 7 studies found a negative relationship, and 28 results pointed to nonsignificant relationships. Based on previous findings, the present authors expect a generally positive association between CSR and CFP in this meta-analysis. If CSR contributes to CFP, then it rejects the idea that CSR is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization. If social responsibility contributes to CFP, then a firm’s resources are being used to advance the interests of shareholders, the rightful claimants in the neoclassical economy (Margolis & Walsh, 2003).

Based on these assumptions, the authors assert the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 1:

CSR will have a positive impact on CFP.

# Direction of Causality Between CSR and CFP

The authors further shed light on the causal relation between CSR and financial performance. Three views on the direction of causality between CSR

Wang et al. - 7

and CFP have been tested empirically: (a) the view that prior CSR positively influences CFP, (b) the view that prior CFP positively influences CSR, and (c) the view defining a recursive relationship between both constructs (Surroca et al., 2010).

The first research stream, related to instrumental stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory, mentioned earlier, suggests that prior CSR positively influences subsequent CFP. This view was confirmed by many empirical studies conducted in different contexts, such as Barnett and Salomon (2006), Bhattacharya and Sen (2003), Brammer and Millington (2004), and Godfrey et al. (2009). The second strand of literature is supported by slack resources theory, which proposes that firms with available slack resources from high levels of financial performance may spend those resources on “doing good by doing well” and those resource allocations may result in improved CSR overall (Waddock & Graves, 1997). In contrast, firms that are in financial trouble may have little freedom to invest in CSR activities such as philanthropy. Some of the empirical evidence, particularly McGuire, Schneeweis, and Branch (1990) and Godfrey et al. (2009), provides support for the slack resources theory. These two previous streams of research were reconciled by Surroca et al. (2010), who argued that causation may run in both directions. That is, better CSR may lead to improved financial performance. Meanwhile, better financial performance may lead to improved CSR. This meta-analysis will test which theoretical hypothesis is right, or whether both of them are supported across the accumulated research. Based on prior studies and empirical findings (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010; Waddock & Graves, 1997), the present authors assert that the basic theoretical underpinnings of these CSR–CFP links are correct, so that there is a positive association between social and financial outcomes in both directions. This assertion involves two hypotheses:

# Hypothesis 2a:

A higher level of prior CSR is associated with better subsequent financial performance.

# Hypothesis 2b:

A better prior financial performance is associated with improved subsequent CSR.

# Measurement Strategy as a Moderator of the CSR–CFP Relationship

CSR is a multidimensional construct defined as the integration of the principles, processes, and policies related to social issues (Wartick & Cochran, 1985), so it is very difficult to identify and measure such a wide range of corporate social behavior. Because little clarity has been reached on the

# Business & Society

Measurement of CSR, some studies have argued that the measurement problem is one fundamental reason for the uncertainty about the relationship between CSR and CFP (Waddock & Graves, 1997). To test whether different measurement strategies lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies, this meta-analysis will break down the whole samples into different CSR subsets based on different operationalizations of this construct.

In prior studies, five kinds of measurement strategies have been frequently used: (a) CSR reputation ratings (Donker, Poff, & Zahir, 2008; Soana, 2011), (b) content analysis (Aras, Aybars, & Kutlu, 2010; Karagiorgos, 2010), (c) surveys (Brik, Rettab, & Mellahi, 2011; Mishra & Suar, 2010), (d) social auditing database (J. Choi & Wang, 2009; Godfrey et al., 2009), and (e) a proxy variable such as corporate philanthropy (Muller & Kraussl, 2011; H. Wang et al., 2008).

Although these five operationalizations are commonly used in the area of CSR research, each of them has limitations. The first type of method uses expert evaluations of corporate policies, such as in Moskowitz (1972). The validity of this methodology depends, to a great extent, on the skills and qualifications of those experts making the assessments (Abbott & Monsen, 1979). To overcome this shortcoming, Fortune magazine gathered a large number of executives, outside directors, and corporate analysts to rate firms. Fortune has conducted the ranking each Fall since 1982 and published summary results each January. The ranking covers the largest firms in 20 to 25 industry groups, with the 10 largest companies in each industry being rated on eight attributes: financial soundness, long-term investment value, use of corporate assets, quality of management, innovativeness, quality of products or services, use of corporate talent, and community and environmental responsibility. Fortune’s reputation rating was popularly used since the 1980s, but this method is viewed as a measure of overall management of a firm rather than being specific to CSR (Waddock & Graves, 1997).

Other researchers have used content analysis of corporate publications such as annual reports, personal handbooks, employee newspapers, and so on. According to Abbott and Monsen (1979), content analysis is a technique for gathering data that consists of codifying qualitative information in anecdotal and literary form into categories to derive quantitative scales of varying levels of complexity. Abbott and Monsen used the Social Involvement Disclosure (SID) scale developed by Ernst and Ernst to code firms’ activities for specific social involvement. Because the research costs are reasonably low in comparison with other forms of data collection, content analysis is widely used in CSR research. However, a reliability issue may emerge when...

Wang et al. - 9

regarding corporate publications as a source of social involvement data. That is, whether the reported variation in social activities among firms is a reflection of real activities or is only an index of company policies on communicating activities to shareholders (Abbott & Monsen, 1979).

The survey, as one of the dominant research approaches in the social science area, is often used in measuring CSR. Drawing on Carroll’s (1979) CSR construct, Aupperle et al. (1985) developed a forced-choice survey instrument to assess a corporate respondent’s social-responsibility orientation. This forced-choice methodology is commonly used to minimize the social desirability of responses. But survey methodologies still have problems relating to return rates and a common method bias when testing the relationship between CSR and CFP.

To deal with the measurement problems noted above, the firm Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD) constructed an index of Corporate Social Performance (CSP) based on eight corporate social performance attributes rated consistently across the entire Standard and Poor’s 500. As an independent rating service that focuses exclusively on assessment of corporate social performance across a range of dimensions related to stakeholder concerns, KLD exhibits robust construct validity around its underlying measures (see Hart & Sharfman, 2012) and has been used by a number of researchers in strategy (Waddock & Graves, 1997), human resources (Turban & Greening, 1997), business and society (Mattingly & Berman, 2006), and finance (Fisman, Heal, & Nair, 2005). The use of the KLD data set, however, is not without its critics. The most serious query is credulity problems, because the data can be and are often stretched to meet the objectives of individual researchers (Godfrey et al., 2009).

The one-dimensional proxy is another frequently used method (Lev et al., 2010; H. Wang et al., 2008). Pollution control investment and corporate philanthropy are usually employed as unidimensional proxy measures for CSR (Bowman & Haire, 1975; Brammer & Millington, 2005). The one-dimensional proxy variable is viewed as a highly visible and objective component with specific attributes that make it particularly amenable to empirical research. But it may not properly reflect the overall level of a company’s CSR and may be difficult to apply consistently across the range of industries and companies that need to be studied (Waddock & Graves, 1997).

As noted, each measurement strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is not easy to capture a truly representative CSR measure in the relevant social domains. Waddock and Graves (1997) suggested that the previous mixed findings on the relationship between profitability and corporate social performance may be partly caused by measurement difficulties. Consequently, the whole sample will be divided into five subsets to examine

# Business & Society

whether CSR measurement strategies moderate the relationship between CSR and CFP. The authors posit the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3:

Different CSR measurement strategies will lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies.

Besides the different operationalizations of CSR, Wood and Jones (1995) were concerned about the stakeholder mismatching problem due to the different financial performance measures, which are focused on different aspects of performance with each one subject to particular biases. Three types of CFP measurement have been tested as dependent variables in previous studies: (a) accounting-based performance (Return on Assets [ROA] or Return on Equity [ROE]), (b) market-based performance (price to earnings ratio or Tobin’s Q), and (c) perceptual measures, such as self-reported surveys of market share, growth, profitability, or size in comparison with other organizations. In this article, the moderate effects of CFP measurements are also examined as follows:

# Hypothesis 4:

Different CFP measurement strategies will lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies.

# Contingency Factors as Moderators of the CSR–CFP Relationship

The authors posit that CSR is positively related to firm financial performance. Furthermore, the authors expect the relationship between CSR and CFP to vary significantly among different operational environments. Some scholars have begun to notice that returns to CSR are contingent, not universal (Ullmann, 1985). Barnett (2007) argued that CSR cannot universally produce favorable returns for all firms all the time, so favorable findings will never be replicable across all data sets. Therefore, researchers should attempt to find contingency factors that explain heterogeneity in financial returns to CSR. Accordingly, two environmental contingency factors, namely, market development and institutional environment, are critical in determining the extent to which firms might benefit from charitable contributions (Doh & Guay, 2006; H. Wang & Qian, 2011).

As mentioned before, CSR contributes to the bottom line via its favorable influence on the firm’s relationships with important stakeholders. The stakeholder relationship is the key mechanism through which firms can gain positive returns from CSR activities. Furthermore, firm visibility serves as a prerequisite for stakeholder response to firm actions (H. Wang & Qian, 2011).

# Wang et al.

Stakeholders need to have the information regarding firms’ social behavior to make a reasonable response. Therefore, when visible firms can draw greater attention from their stakeholders, it will be easier for them to get positive responses from stakeholders. In contrast, firms may not benefit much from social involvement under a low firm visibility and stakeholder awareness, even if they have invested a lot in CSR. Obviously, a firm’s visibility and stakeholder awareness vary significantly across different levels of development of the market in which the firm operates. Due to the various information channels and effective market supervision, business information will be more symmetric and valid in a developed market. Then, the stakeholders can obtain information about firms’ social behavior more efficiently and make responses more accurately. Subsequently, those responses for CSR will turn into positive financial gains. But the situation is different in a developing market. Short of advanced media exposure and efficient market supervision, the active and initiative social efforts of firms competing in less developed markets will be less noticed and gain unequal financial gains compared with those in well-developed markets.

Aside from the market environment, the institutional environments are also different between developed and developing economies, and such institutional variations in a cross-national context may moderate the degree to which stakeholders can influence managers (Campbell, 2007). Campbell (2007) has argued that the relationship between socially responsible corporate behavior and economic conditions is moderated by several institutional factors, such as public and private regulations, the presence of nongovernmental and other independent organizations that monitor corporate behavior, institutionalized norms regarding appropriate corporate behavior, associative behavior among corporations themselves, and organized dialogues among corporations and their stakeholders. In a developed market, the local government will publish specific policies to encourage firms to take social responsibility. For example, local communities may provide a philanthropic firm with tax breaks or favorable terms for using local infrastructure (H. Wang et al., 2008). Then firms may decrease costs and increase income via CSR thereby increasing CFP. But in a less developed market, firms cannot gain such positive returns without well-forced institutional systems. Under a loose and ineffective governmental regulation, corporations would act in more socially irresponsible ways and would not worry about the potential risk of regulatory sanctions. Thus, those socially unresponsive firms incur fewer direct costs and, ceteris paribus, reap higher profits than socially responsive firms. In that sense, socially responsive companies are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their unresponsive peers. This competitive disadvantage is particularly serious in an era of increased globalization, because the capacity for

# Business & Society

firms to move investments and productions from one regulatory regime to another has increased. To retain local investment, production, jobs, and tax revenues, some national governments would ease business regulations that help militate against socially irresponsible corporate behavior (Campbell, 2007). Thus, corporations may not be able to gain competitive advantages from socially responsible behavior. So based on the above logic, the authors posit the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 5:

The relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from developed economies than from developing economies.

# Method

# Data-Collection

To ensure the representativeness and completeness of the study database, a three-stage sampling procedure was conducted to identify literature to be included in the meta-analysis (Barnett, 2007; Godfrey, 2005; Margolis & Walsh, 2003). In the first stage, the authors searched the ABI/INFORM database for studies published from 2003 to 2012 with the following search terms: corporate social responsibility, corporate social performance, environmental performance, and financial performance. Second, a manual search of several relevant journals (Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Strategic Management Journal, Organizational Studies, and Journal of Business Ethics) was also conducted. Third, the authors examined the reference sections of all major reviews of research previously published on the topic to identify any studies overlooked in the previous two stages.

Studies were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis on the basis of three criteria. First, the meta-analysis included only those empirical studies that reported sample sizes and an outcome statistic (r, univariate F, t, χ²) that allowed the computation of a correlation coefficient with the formulas provided by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). Results that only reported multivariate models were excluded. Second, only those studies that measured constructs at the firm level were included. Third, studies were considered independent only when they reported correlation coefficients from different samples. So the results based on data used in other studies that were already included were excluded. Upon completion of the literature retrieval procedures, the authors obtained a total of 119 effect sizes reported in 42 studies. The complete collection of studies is summarized in the appendix.

To reduce coding error, the authors prepared a coding protocol specifying the information to be extracted from each study. The coding form was prepared.

# Data-Analysis

The authors conducted this meta-analysis according to the guidelines provided by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). First of all, we converted the reported statistics into a common effect size. To account for the skewness of the distribution of sample correlation coefficients, we transformed the correlation into Fisher’s z coefficients with the formula *y = 0.5 × logi (1 + ri)/(1 - ri). Then the authors averaged and weighted the z coefficients by the formula Vi = 1/(N - 3)*.

There are two general models: the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model. The fixed-effects meta-analysis assumes the population effect sizes are equal for all studies, so the differences on the observed effect sizes are due to sampling error. As for the random-effects model, the population effect sizes can be different across studies (Hedges & Vevea, 1998). The differences on the observed effect sizes are due to a combination of true difference (variance component) and sampling error. It is usually preferred methodologically. The authors conducted a homogeneity test with the R package to determine whether a fixed- or random-effects model should be used. Under the assumption of homogeneity (H0: β1 = β2 = β3 = ... = βk), the test statistic Q has a chi-square distribution with df = (No. of studies − 1). In the authors’ database, Q is equal to 275.3655 (df = 118, p < .001); thus, we rejected the null hypothesis that all effect sizes are equal. For this reason, the authors chose the random-effects model to conduct this meta-analysis.

# Table 1

summarizes the number of effect sizes, cumulative sample sizes, corrected correlations, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals around the corrected correlations for each pairwise relationship. Providing support for Hypothesis 1, the authors obtained a significant, positive correlation for the relationship between CSR and CFP (r = .0587, p < .001). In addition, the results report the I2 index, which is interpreted as the proportion of total variation due to heterogeneity between studies (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). As a rule of thumb, I2 of 25%, 50%, and 75% can be considered as low, moderate, and high heterogeneity. In the study database, I2 is equal to 73.65%, which means that a high degree of heterogeneity exists among the conclusions on the relationships between CSR and CFP. A further investigation on the moderating effects on this relationship will be discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.

Furthermore, the authors examined the causal direction between CSR and CFP. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the instrumental stakeholder theory is supported by the primary studies. The corrected coefficient between prior CSR and subsequent CFP is equal to .0319 (p < .001, N = 39,913), which means Hypothesis 2a is supported. However, the slack resources theory has not been supported. The positive association between prior CFP and subsequent CSR is not significant in this meta-analysis. Concurrent studies facilitate a positive corrected coefficient, which is equal to .0678 (p < .001, N = 125,085).

# Sensitivity Analysis

Although the meta-analysis is very powerful, it is not without problems. The file drawer problem is known as a publication bias. Nonsignificant findings are less likely to be submitted and accepted for publication. So the published findings are more likely to be significant than unpublished findings. In this study, the authors conducted a file drawer analysis to get the number of unpublished papers with null effect required to neutralize the average effect. As shown in the last column of Table 1, it will require 7,369 unpublished studies with null effect to subvert the positive relationship between CSR and CFP. The cross-sectional result is also robust, which requires 5,218 unpublished studies to challenge the positive results. As suggested by Rosenthal (1991), the file drawer tolerance is set at 5X + 10, where X = number of studies. Although the fail-safe number on the relationship between prior CSR and subsequent CFP is just 262, it is more than sufficient for the tolerance level (70).

# Results

To investigate the moderating effect of different measurement strategies on the relationship between CSR and CFP, the authors divided all the samples into five subgroups based on the operationalizations of CSR and three subgroups based on the operationalizations of CFP. The authors followed the guidelines provided by Viechtbauer (2010) to conduct a QM test to examine the moderate effects. QM test based on the levels of a categorical moderator is a frequent practice in meta-analyses (Viechtbauer, 2010). The value of QM is equal to 151.1894 (p < .0001, df = 5), which indicates that the different types of operationalizations of CSR are significantly moderating the relationship between CSR and CFP. In other words, the relationships based on different measurement strategies of CSR are significantly different (see Table 2).

Specifically, for the 25 effect sizes that use reputation ratings, the corrected r is .0251 (p = .0572). Twenty effect sizes examined CSR by content analysis, but the corrected r is not significant (r = .0181, p = .4293). This result might be related to the problems of a methodological nature raised by Abbott and Monsen (1979). When content analysis is employed, it is necessary to formulate a set of categories and code the raw data in terms of the categories. Then, two types of problems are possible. First, the formulation of categories that do not reflect all the issues actually contained in the report. Second, the raw data may be inaccurately coded in terms of the selected categories (Abbott & Monsen, 1975). These shortcomings of content analysis might cause the differences in CSR measurements and facilitate the heterogenic relationship between CSR and CFP.

For 32 effect sizes using surveys, the corrected r is .1427 (p < .0001). This result indicated that the relationship measured by surveys is the largest effect. On one hand, it is because this method has the advantage of construct validity. On the other hand, the authors cannot deny the problem of common method bias overestimating the relationship.

A growing number of studies examine CSR by using an independent social auditing database. The corrected r is equal to .0405 (p < .0001). The 10 effect sizes that rely on a proxy variable to assess CSR reveal a corrected r of .0372 (p < .0001). Taken together, these results suggest that the relationship between CSR and CFP is positive across all different kinds of measurement strategies.

Table 3 indicates that the association between CSR and CFP depends on the researchers’ operational definition of CFP. Same as the procedure mentioned before, the authors conducted a QM test. The result shows a significant moderating effect of the CFP operationalization. QM = 115.4095 (p < .0001, df = 3) supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study manipulation. Across all the three measurement strategies, the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly positive. Particularly, the perceptual measures (r = .1852, p < .0001) are more highly correlated with CSR than accounting and market-based CFP. Seventy-one effect sizes collected financial data based on the accounting measurement, and the corrected r is equal to .0489 (p < .0001), which is a little bit higher than the market-based measurement (r = .0378, p < .0001).

Hypothesis 5 stated that the relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies. To test this predication, the authors separated the original studies into two categories: studies based on data obtained from advanced economies and studies based on data from developing economies. The authors

followed a UN classification for this categorization (Nachum, 2004). The QM is equal to 51.5369 (p < .0001), presenting a significant moderating effect for this contingency factor. The studies’ results based on data from advanced economies yield stronger effect sizes than those obtained from developing economies (r = .0404 vs. r = .0175, respectively). Meanwhile, the statistical power is different between the developed and developing countries. For the studies based in the developing countries, the p value is significant at the level of .1. However, it is significant at the level of .001 for the samples from the developed countries. Therefore, Hypothesis 5 is supported (see Table 4).

# Discussion

The relationship between CSR and CFP has been extensively studied in strategic and organizational management, yet the empirical findings on its importance have been noticeably mixed. The authors conducted a meta-analytic review to seek to clarify this issue. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives regarding instrumental stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory, this study reviews the linkage of CSR–CFP at the organizational level and answers the following questions: (a) whether CSR is positively linked to financial performance; (b) and if so, in what direction does the causation run; and (c) whether methodological and contextual heterogeneities moderate CSR–CFP linkage.

The results of this study make several contributions to the literature on the value of CSR. First, based on 42 studies and 119 effect sizes, an integration correlation revealed a positive association of CSR–CFP linkage, thus answering positively the question: Do firms “do well by doing good”? This question has been invoked as the primary concern of the management literature on CSR (McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright 2006). Showing that a firm does well by doing good is often referred to as making the business case for CSR (McWilliams & Siegel, 2006). Therefore, understanding whether CSR is effective in facilitating organizational performance is not only important to researchers but also financially meaningful to practitioners who have been practicing or are being advised to practice social involvement. As a compilation of previous findings cannot produce a definitive conclusion, Margolis and Walsh (2003) argued that “the CSP-CFP empirical literature reinforces, rather than relieves the tension surrounding corporate responses to social misery” (p. 278). The findings drawn from this meta-analysis thus provide some indication that prior literature, in aggregate, indicates a positive relationship between CSR and CFP, which is supposed to be beneficial to clarifying the mystery.

Second, this research adds to the existing concerns on the antecedents of CSR behavior. There are many factors, found in the past 30 years of research, potentially influencing a firm’s social involvement. Without a comprehensive consideration of those factors, it may be hard to say that any one of them, such as financial performance, positively caused subsequent CSR. As stated above, the study results did not support the slack resource theory, which assumed that firms with good prior financial performance would be associated with a higher degree of subsequent social responsibility. The authors believe that this result may be related to the diverse and complex predictions determining companies’ social responsibility. For the past 30 years of research, a great number of scholars have discussed, from exogenous and endogenous perspectives, the antecedents of CSR. Government requirements, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), developing status, and social security are viewed as external antecedents of social-level factors. One source of endogenous influences are firm-level factors, such as CFP (Aupperle et al., 1985; McGuire et al., 1988; Moskowitz, 1972), firm strategy (Berman et al., 1999), business exposure (Miles, 1987), political participation level (Wu, 2006), and institutional ownership (Hansen & Hill, 1991). Another type of endogenous factor focuses on the individual factors, for instance, managers’ demographic characteristics, managerial value, and CEO power (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1987; Hambrick & Mason, 1984).

This viewpoint gets support to a certain extent from Mishina, Dykes, Block, and Pollock (2010). Arguing that “good firms do bad things,” they found that high firm accounting performance is positively related to the likelihood that a firm engages in corporate illegality, and this likelihood being due to a lot of pressure to maintain high relative performance that may induce risk-seeking behaviors. Recent history illustrates the complexity of this issue. Many of the firms involved in corporate scandals, such as Arthur Andersen, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and several leading investment banks, were generally viewed as high-performing companies until their scandals were uncovered (Mishina et al., 2010).

Third, this study also contributes to the literature on CSR by demonstrating how measurement strategy and environmental context may explain the heterogeneity of CSR–CFP linkage. The meta-analytic correlations indicate that the association between CSR and CFP depends on the researcher’s operational definition of each construct. Overall, the findings with respect to CSR operationalizations suggest that the relationship measured by surveys produces the strongest effect compared with the other four types of CSR measurements. Meanwhile, content analysis appears to have an insignificant impact on CFP. Market-based measures of CFP were less highly correlated.

# Business & Society

with CSR than accounting and perceptual measures. In that sense, two theoretical implications are noteworthy. On one hand, CSR is a multidimensional construct, which has yet to contribute a few pieces of puzzle in its definition and measurement among previous studies. As discussed above, many measures have been used in empirical research on CSR. The great disparity of CSR measures has made it very difficult for research to cumulate. As Wood and Jones (1995) pointed out,

measures are developed for certain purposes—say, to test for a statistical link between corporate social responsibility and financial performance such as ROI—and they may not be readily transferrable to other purposes, such as the development of a general theory of corporate social performance. (p. 240)

The meta-analytic result of high correlation between CFP and CSR measured by survey is consistent with Wood and Jones’s point. However, some scholars have begun to move toward a new theory of the firm—a stakeholder theory—that would permit a better understanding of CSR. According to Freeman (1984), the main founder of stakeholder theory, stakeholder indicates groups and organizations that are affected by or can affect a company’s operations. Stakeholders are not unitary, which serve a single function for a firm; rather, they engage in many different behaviors with respect to the firm, while filling several critical roles. Within a stakeholder-based theoretical perspective, CSR is a way for firms to engage more fully in their societal relationships and duties (Wood & Jones, 1995). The insignificant integrated results based on content analysis, in this meta-analysis, also show that a comprehensive and complex framework is essential to evaluate CSR. Therefore, the authors suggest that stakeholder theory is the most relevant theoretical framework for assessing corporate social performance.

On the other hand, the meta-analytic outcomes support the view that differences in previous studies resulted from “stakeholder mismatching.” As Wood and Jones (1995) argued, different stakeholders might differently set expectations, experience the effects, and evaluate the outcomes for a particular measure of corporate performance. Multiple stakeholders can be involved in different ways in a single instance of firm behavior. Hence, the ambiguous results are largely due to studies not choosing variables and predicting relationships that would be appropriate within a stakeholder/CSR framework. The meta-analysis supports the Orlitzky et al. (2003) suggestion that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioral measures of CSR, because there is no theory to explain why stockholders would buy a company’s stock for its high-level donation.

# Wang et al.

Moreover, incorporating multiple moderators allows for a comprehensive understanding of the contextual contingencies between CSR and CFP. In recent studies, scholars have argued that socially responsible corporate behavior varied across countries and appealed for more attention to a cross-national comparison (Campbell, 2007). But for the shortage of multinational data, the comparative research based on different background is still rare. However, meta-analysis can overcome this issue to a certain extent by integrating empirical results across diverse contexts. More specifically, by including market development and institutional environment as a contextual moderator, the authors found the relationship between CSR and CFP to vary significantly within different operational environments. This finding provides insight for cross-cultural research and practical implication for multinational firms.

Future studies should explore the macro-level and societal factors that may moderate this relationship. Macro-level variables, such as the munificence of natural resources, relative wealth, and the type of government and its stability, help vary the CSR–CFP link. Societal moderators, such as religion, historic traditions, and moral culture, also influence this relationship (Robertson & Crittenden, 2003). This meta-analysis result also provided some strategic implications for multinational firms. Corporate managers are mindful of the fact that business norms and standards, regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder demands for CSR can vary substantially across nations and regions (McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). If multinational firms fail to concern about local ethical norms pursued by cross-cultural alliance partners, distributors, suppliers, customers, financiers, and foreign government agencies, they may come across public relations disasters.

The present study is also subject to a number of limitations. First, although the authors have conducted a file drawer analysis to examine the publication bias, the authors could not perfectly solve this problem. Among the 42 studies, most are from journals, and only 1 is a doctoral dissertation. The authors have done their best to search for studies with a wide range of resources, but the file drawer problem is still a key shortcoming of a meta-analysis. Second, as previous research mentioned, the relationship between CSR and CFP varies significantly with the different characteristics of firms and their operational environments (H. Wang & Qian, 2011). In this study, the authors have investigated the moderating effects of measurement strategies and environmental factors. But, for the shortage of relative data, firm-level moderators and other potential moderators, which might explain the variance across studies, have not been identified and examined, warranting further research in the future.

# Conclusion

CSR studies have improved over time with stronger theoretical rationales, more relevant operationalizations, and more and better controls for previously omitted variables, “yet the improved rigor has only produced rigor mortis” (Barnett, 2007, p. 796). Even after three decades of research, differences in perspective have only accumulated, not dissipated, thereby further obscuring the big picture (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). The meta-analytic review, together with extensive discussions and future research suggestions, may furnish a reference for further theory development, research design, and empirical analysis in the field. The authors hope that this review clarifies and solidifies scholarly knowledge of CSR and its value in enhancing financial performance.

Synthesizing research findings of 42 empirical studies on the linkage between CSR and financial performance, this study endorses the prevalent argument that CSR enhances CFP. Furthermore, the authors explored the direction of the causation. The authors found that subsequent financial performance is positively associated with prior social responsibility, in support of the instrumental stakeholder theory. That theory suggests that firms can “do well by doing good.” However, the reverse direction is not supported in this study. That is, the evidence suggests that prior high level of financial performance has virtually no significant effect on firms’ subsequent social involvement.

The results of subgroup analyses confirmed the authors’ propositions that the heterogeneity of the CSR and CFP relationship may result from the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP. The empirical evidence implies that the relationship measured by surveys produces the strongest effect compared with the other four types of CSR measurements. Another subgroup analysis based on different operational measures of CFP shows that the perceptual measures are more highly correlated with CSR than accounting and market-based CFP. The final set analysis examined the moderating effects of environmental context on the CSR and CFP relationship. The results show that the relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.

# Note

1. These five journals are chosen for two reasons. They are either ranked as the top journals in the area of management or mainly focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR). The authors also tried to include Business & Society (BAS), which has a high impact factor (1.936 in 2012), but BAS focuses on relatively wide-spread topics besides CSR, such as corporate governance, and business–government relations. So the authors did not conduct a manual search on it, but some papers on CSR–CFP (corporate financial performance) from BAS are included in the meta-analysis.

ChatGPT is a new technology for natural language processing (NLP) that could change the way conversational AI works. It combines deep learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning to make chatbots that can act like humans. The goal of ChatGPT is to make it possible for machines to understand what people say and respond in a natural way. In this paper, we discuss the methodology behind ChatGPT and how it works in detail. At its core, ChatGPT uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which lets it learn from previous conversations and contextual information about each conversation topic or context provided by the user's input sentence(s). This makes it possible to make more correct predictions than with the rule-based methods used by chatbots like ELIZA or AIML. Also, unlike these rule-based approaches, which are limited by the size of their preprogrammed knowledge bases, RNN architectures can be trained on large datasets, such as those available through open source projects like OpenAI Gpt2 or Google's BERT model and can be scaled up almost indefinitely. The most important part of training is to use reinforcement learning techniques along with supervised machine translation models like the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model in the Google Translate API. By using both of these training methods at the same time, ChatGPT can quickly learn new ideas based on what users say while also adapting to the different situations in each conversation thread. During training, when these two methods are used together, ChatGPT can quickly learn new ideas based on what the user says while also being able to adapt to different situations in each conversation thread. Also, skills that could be used in more than one area can be learned in one area. This makes this method very scalable over time. Lastly, because it can come up with useful answers even when given incomplete sentences, it's a great fit for real-world applications where people might not always give their virtual assistants or chatbots all the information they need up front but still want helpful answers back.

they require insight into how mathematics works, which again is something that only humans at present possess. Food recipes also need to be created by people who understand taste preferences as well as nutrition values associated with different ingredients, something that machines cannot do yet without being heavily programmed beforehand on what kinds of tastes should go together, etc.

From these examples, it's clear why none of these tasks can be done well with chat GPTs right now: they don't have the skills needed to understand context or make decisions based on taste or preference, which are important when dealing with things like news updates or making or changing food recipes. As technology gets better, there may be some level of automation in these areas in the future, but until then, people are still needed.

# 22. THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DOMINATED BY CHATGPT

The question of whether chatbots, such as the popular ChatGPT, will take over the human race in the future is a complex one. With advancements in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) continuing to evolve rapidly, it is hard to predict what our world may look like decades from now. Some experts are worried that AI-driven automation could cause humans to lose their jobs or be affected in other ways long-term.

However, there are several reasons why we shouldn't worry too much about a "robot uprising" happening anytime soon. First of all, ChatGPT has shown impressive abilities when it comes to generating natural language responses based on input data sets. However, its current level of sophistication is still far behind that of a real person who can think critically and creatively to solve problems without relying only on preprogrammed algorithms. [19] Also, AI systems don't have any kind of emotional intelligence, which makes it hard for them to understand subtle social situations or work well with people outside of highly controlled environments like customer service chat bots, which are used by many companies today. Lastly, most experts agree that robots would need to make a lot of technological progress before they could fully replace humans in all fields. This seems unlikely to occur in our lifetimes, given current trends, development, and investment in research and development in these areas. In conclusion, increasing levels of automation made possible by technologies like ChatGPT may change some parts of work life, but we shouldn't worry too much about possible dystopian futures where machines rule supreme over people.

# 24. GOOGLE CHROME: A TOP BROWSER IN THE WORLD

For quite some time, Google has been the undisputed leader in browser market share. According to Stat Counter, Google Chrome had a 65% global usage share as of April 2020. This is more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer, at just under 15%. Other browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari, make up 11% and 7%, respectively. The popularity of Google Chrome is attributable to its ease of use and wide range of features, [21] which make it an attractive option for both casual internet users and search engine optimization professionals alike. It also offers great integration with other Google services like Gmail, Drive, and Maps, which makes it even more appealing to those who are already using multiple products from the company’s portfolio. Furthermore, regular updates ensure that users can always access the most recent security patches, allowing them to browse the web safely without fear of their data being compromised by hackers or malicious software programs lurking on the websites they visit on a daily basis.

To sum up, it is obvious that Google Chrome has a major foothold in the browser market. Its user-friendly interface coupled with powerful features makes it an ideal choice for most people out there. In addition, its tight integration with other popular Google services gives them another reason why this particular product stands out from all others offered by competitors such as Microsoft, Bing, Yahoo, etc.

# 25. GOOGLE: A MAJOR PLAYER IN SEARCH ENGINES MARKET SHARE

Search engine [22] market share is an important indicator of a company’s success in the online space. Google leads the industry in search engine [22] market share, with Microsoft Bing, Yahoo!, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari trailing behind. Compared to its competitors, Google has the largest market [22] share for search engines. Google has been the most popular search engine for a long time. Around 90% of all searches done on desktop computers and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are done on Google. Its closest competitor is Microsoft Bing, which holds around 7% of total worldwide searches, while Yahoo! and other smaller players such as DuckDuckGo make up only a small fraction at 2%. Google has a 99%+ market share in the mobile market because its Android operating system comes pre-installed on most phones sold around the world today.

In comparison to other browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari, these have much lower usage when compared against Chrome (the browser developed by Google). Statcounter Global Stats data from October 2020 shows that 69% of users were on Chrome, 14% on Safari, 6% on Edge/IE, 4% on FireFox, and 1% on Opera. It's clear that people like Chrome because it works faster than other browsers and has easy-access features like saving passwords. This is helpful for people who are always on the go or need quick access on multiple devices at the same time without having to log into each one individually. With this kind of advantage over competing products, it’s no surprise why Chrome continues to dominate the browser industry despite fierce competition from rivals like Firefox and Edge/IE.

Overall, Google's products (Google Search and Chrome) have the most market share in both the search engine [23] market and the browser market. This gives Google an edge over competitors like Microsoft Bing.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that the implementation of artificial intelligence-driven solutions such as those provided by Chat GPT into various business sectors has revolutionized how organizations operate today. By providing them with access to powerful automation tools that enable faster processing times as well as improved efficiency levels across all departments, these technologies provide significant competitive advantages over traditional methods, which may soon become obsolete if not already so due to their poor performance when compared to what modern-day AIs can do now. Then, it's easy to see why so many organizations choose to use this kind of technology in their daily operations: doing so has a lot of potential financial and operational benefits. Human input and software like web browsers can aid in creating AI that is dependable, accurate, and practical for many purposes. The system has difficulty with tough or strange situations, but still shows great improvement in this area. The bot is mostly trained on data up to 2021, so newer events may still need to be found by the chat GPT. Simple requests, like asking about the date and time, cannot be handled by it, as it lacks contextual understanding. Though AI models can offer realistic solutions to certain issues, their accuracy may be questionable since they are still in development.

# Board Characteristics and Corporate Social Responsibility: A Meta-Analytic Investigation

# Jan Endrikat1,2, Charl de Villiers3,4, Thomas W. Guenther2, and Edeltraud M. Guenther2,5

# Abstract

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics–CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR.

committee plays a mediating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

The relationships between corporate board characteristics and firm performance are well researched in the strategic management and corporate governance literature. From an agency theory perspective, boards serve a monitoring function to ensure the alignment of managerial actions with shareholder interests (Fama & Jensen, 1983), reducing agency costs that may arise when managers pursue their own interests at the expense of shareholders. Resource dependence theory (RDT) highlights another function of the board, namely, the provision of access to resources, such as knowledge and networks, critical to firms’ success (Hillman et al., 2000; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Hillman and Dalziel (2003) suggest that both monitoring and resource provision determine the association between board characteristics and firm performance.

While most studies concerned with board characteristics and firm performance focus on financial performance, recently several scholars have investigated the association between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR), a nonfinancial dimension of firm performance (de Villiers et al., 2011; Walls et al., 2012). CSR has become increasingly prevalent and visible within firms as a mechanism to cope with stakeholder demands and to manage societal expectations beyond firms’ financial aims (H. Wang et al., 2016). Evolving from a long-standing debate about firms’ responsibilities toward society and from an enormous body of empirical work concerned with the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance, the business case perspective increasingly prevails (i.e., the view that CSR enables firms to enhance their competitive advantage and that firms benefit from CSR in terms of financial performance, Carroll & Shabana, 2010). Recent studies (Eccles et al., 2014; Surroca et al., 2010), as well as earlier meta-analyses (Orlitzky et al., 2003), suggest a positive association.

between CSR and corporate financial performance. CSR is deemed to create firm value by providing better access to valuable resources (Waddock & Graves, 1997), attracting high-quality employees (Turban & Greening, 1997), increasing customer value of products and services (Peloza & Shang, 2011), and enabling the development of intangible assets (Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Consequently, CSR can be seen as a strategic imperative and an increasing number of investors consider CSR in their decision-making (Khan et al., 2016). In view of the strategic importance of CSR and given the decisive role that boards play in corporate strategy and decision-making processes (Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002; Tang et al., 2015), it is important to fully consider reliable scientific evidence regarding the board characteristics associated with superior CSR.

However, the available empirical evidence regarding these relationships is difficult to assess for at least three reasons. First, different studies provide conflicting evidence. For example, Walls and colleagues (2012) find a negative relationship between the number of directors and the environmental dimension of CSR and concluded that smaller boards “[. . .] can mitigate detrimental environmental performance more effectively” (p. 901), whereas Post and colleagues (2011) find a positive relationship between the same constructs, leading them to conclude that “[. . .] having more directors provides boards with more information about environmental issues (rather than the opposite argument that board size leads to chaos and inaction) [. . .]” (p. 211). Similarly, Galbreath (2016) reports a negative relationship between CEO–chair duality (i.e., a CEO that also serves as the chairman of the board) and CSR, whereas Ferrero-Ferrero and colleagues (2015) do not find a significant relationship. Such conflicting empirical results undermine the establishment of credible scientific generalizations, impeding advances in managerial practice and regulatory reform.

Second, while studies examine various aspects such as board size, the number of outside directors, or CEO–chair duality and their relationships with CSR, most of them examine the board characteristics in isolation. Thus, while theoretically self-evident, little is known about whether, and how, certain board characteristics may interact with each other in their relationships with CSR (Galbreath, 2016; Oh et al., 2018; Rao & Tilt, 2016). In this vein, Jain and Jamali (2016) conclude from their review on corporate governance and CSR that future research needs to “[. . .] rethink CG [corporate governance] mechanisms as bundles rather than piecemeal” (p. 266). Moreover, prior empirical studies employ overly simplistic models that only investigate direct relationships while potential mediating mechanisms have been neglected. Finally, as CSR is becoming increasingly prevalent on a global scale and while several studies have begun to explore relationships between board characteristics and CSR in different institutional contexts.

settings (Chang et al., 2017; Young & Thyil, 2014), we have limited knowledge about whether different legal and sociocultural contexts determine the focal relationships. Finally, CSR constitutes a multidimensional construct encompassing a range of aspects, such as employee relations, philanthropy, and environmental performance (Walls et al., 2012; H. Wang et al., 2016), which can be grouped into social and environmental dimensions. However, to date, no quantitative review has investigated the (potentially) different relationships between the social versus the environmental dimension of CSR and board characteristics.

To address and shed light on these issues, we draw on meta-analytic methods to further develop and refine the understanding of the relationship between board characteristics and CSR. Based on the available evidence from prior studies, we examine the relationships between CSR and board size, board independence, female board representation, CEO–chair duality, and the existence of a CSR committee. First, we quantitatively synthesize existing empirical research on the relationships between these board characteristics and CSR by means of random-effects meta-analysis. Second, we specify and test a meta-analytic path model to examine the interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and to investigate whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a mediating role. Third, we explore potential moderating effects by using meta-analytic regression analysis.

Our study aims to make three contributions to the literature. First, in terms of an empirical contribution, we clarify the direction and strength of the relationships between certain board characteristics and CSR, drawing on cumulative data allowing us to provide more definitive answers than those reported in any single primary study. In particular, our analysis is based on 82 studies providing us with correlations based on a total of 167,317 firm-year observations. Thus, first, we resolve the uncertainties raised in the narrative review of Jain and Jamali (2016), by providing aggregated, generalized evidence regarding the relationships between CSR and the most widely empirically examined board characteristics; second, we move beyond Byron and Post’s (2016) focus on women on boards. While we find that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR, we do not find a significant relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR.

Second, we make a theoretical contribution and advance the literature by hypothesizing and testing a model that (a) accounts for the likely interrelatedness of board characteristics and their joint influence on CSR and (b) incorporates the potential mediating role of the presence of a CSR committee. Hence, we add to the recent literature that applies a more holistic approach.

# Endrikat et al.

and seek to uncover more complex relationships that might be at play in promoting CSR (Aguilera et al., 2012; Jain & Jamali, 2016; Oh et al., 2018).

Third, our article also contributes to theory refinement by showing that country-level factors, as well as the specific dimensions of CSR, moderate the focal relationships. In particular, we provide evidence that investor protection strength moderates the relationships between board size and CSR and between board independence and CSR. We ascribe these results to countries’ investor protection substituting for these board-level influences. Moreover, we find that a country’s level of gender parity moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR, specifically that countries’ gender parity complements (or amplifies) the effect of female board representation on CSR. Those aspects can be hardly explored by primary studies due to data collection constraints (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Our findings in this regard establish some boundary conditions on the analyzed relationships and highlight the importance of taking into account macro-contextual factors when studying the relationship between board characteristics and CSR.

Finally, our results show that the particular dimension of CSR that is examined (i.e., environmental vs. social dimension) influences board characteristics–CSR relationships. Hence, we add to the growing stream of research that acknowledges the multidimensional nature of CSR and thus seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of organizational commitment to society (H. Wang et al., 2016). In sum, our study is valuable both for advancing the academic discussion on the relationships between board characteristics and CSR, and for informing business and regulatory practice.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. First, we introduce the constructs used in our meta-analytic examinations and draw on theoretical arguments and prior empirical evidence to derive our hypotheses. Subsequently, we describe our procedures for the identification and coding of the primary studies and outline our methods of analysis. After having presented our findings, we discuss them and conclude with a review of contributions, limitations, and directions for future research.

# Theoretical Background and Hypotheses

# Construct Definitions and Theoretical Overview

Although several theoretical frameworks have been used to posit links between particular board characteristics and CSR, the relationships between board characteristics and CSR that we examine can be theorized using either agency theory–related arguments, resource provision arguments, or a combination of both. For example, although feminist ethics theories (Boulouta,

2013; Slote, 2007) may inform us about the specific characteristics of female directors, ultimately those characteristics constitute resources (including capabilities and perspectives) that female directors bring into the boardroom, and therefore, the influence of female directors on CSR can be argued and explained by referring to resource dependence theory (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Agency theory posits that directors serve as agents of firms’ shareholders and play a monitoring role to ensure that managers act in the interest of shareholders, as the owners of the firm (Fama & Jensen, 1983). Vigilant directors can reduce agency costs (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003) and ensure appropriate processes of strategy development and formulation (McNulty & Pettigrew, 1999). RDT, however, emphasizes directors’ role in providing firms with access to resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) such as networks, knowledge and insight, advice and counsel, legitimacy, and communication channels between the firm and external organizations and parties (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003). Furthermore, directors’ expertise and their access to expanded networks provide reputational benefits and legitimacy to firms (Daily & Schwenk, 1996) and can reduce uncertainty (Hillman et al., 2000).

Our reliance on agency- and resource dependence-related arguments corresponds with a recent stream of literature that emphasizes boards’ duties in protecting shareholders’ wealth as well as creating new wealth (Filatotchev, 2007; Zahra et al., 2009). On one hand, boards must minimize downside shareholder risk by monitoring managers, on the other hand, boards should also enable managerial entrepreneurship so that shareholders and other stakeholders benefit from the upside potential of firms (Filatotchev, 2007). This is consistent with Hillman and Dalziel’s (2003) notion of the two main functions of boards—monitoring and resource provision.

CSR can be defined as the integration of social and environmental concerns into firms’ operations and paying attention to stakeholders’ concerns (Carroll, 1979; Cheng et al., 2014; H. Wang et al., 2016). The most prominent stream in CSR research considers whether CSR adds financial value to the firm. This question can be considered settled for two reasons. First, the available meta-analyses all point to a (weak but) significant positive association between CSR and corporate financial performance (Endrikat et al., 2014; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Second, firms increasingly adopt CSR initiatives due to public awareness and pressure from various stakeholder groups (H. Wang et al., 2016; Ioannou & Serafeim, 2015). The recent United Nations Global Compact-Accenture (2019) CEO Survey shows that 94% of the more than 1,000 participating CEOs from around the world believe that CSR issues are important to the future success of their business. Because of the strategic importance of CSR and the fundamental role of boards in strategy development, boards are considered key players in firms’ CSR activities, being

# Endrikat et al.

directly or indirectly responsible for firms’ CSR strategy and performance and the consequences thereof (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002; Rao & Tilt, 2016).

Prior research has examined a variety of board characteristics. Of course, the constructs in any meta-analysis are restricted to the ones examined with some regularity in the prior literature, which is also the case with this study. Board size refers to the number of board members. Board independence refers to the number or proportion of outside directors (i.e., directors that are independent because they are not part of the management team) (Bergh et al., 2016). In line with Post and Byron (2015), we define female board representation as the number, proportion, or presence of women on boards of directors. CEO–chair duality refers to whether the same person jointly holds the titles of chief executive officer and chairperson of the board (Bergh et al., 2016). We define CSR committee as the existence of a board committee specifically responsible for CSR-related matters, and in practice, these committees may also be referred to as “sustainability,” “corporate ethics,” or “environmental” committees (Helfaya & Moussa, 2017).

# Board Size and CSR

Regarding the monitoring role of boards—the primary focus of agency theory arguments pertaining to boards of directors—it has been argued that larger boards are more actively involved in monitoring and evaluating activities and are less susceptible to managerial domination (Zahra & Pearce, 1989). According to RDT—highlighting the resource provision function of directors—firms should benefit from larger boards, because there are more directors, who can each provide access to resources, such as specialized knowledge and networks (Hillman et al., 2009; Pfeffer, 1972). In particular, the presence of more directors potentially provides more external links and knowledge to secure critical CSR resources, more CSR-related experience, knowledge, advice, and counsel (Dalton et al., 1999; de Villiers et al., 2011). Therefore, we state the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1 (H1): Board size is positively related to CSR.

# Board Independence and CSR

From an agency theory viewpoint, outside directors are better monitors of managers, as they are independent of the top management team and the firm (Dalton et al., 1998; J. L. Johnson et al., 1996). Because CSR goes hand in hand with a more long-term orientation of firms (Eccles et al., 2014) and as

# Business & Society 00(0)

CSR activities need some time to translate into firm value (Carroll & Shabana, 2010), outside directors may be more likely to foster CSR, because they tend to pursue longer time horizons and thus are more likely to see the long-term potential of investments in environmental and social projects (de Villiers et al., 2011; Post et al., 2011). Also from an RDT perspective, the number of independent directors should relate positively to CSR because they are more likely to have, and provide, access to alternative sources of CSR-related knowledge and networks, than directors who are associated with the firm. Therefore, our second hypothesis is:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2): Board independence is positively related to CSR.

# Female Board Representation and CSR

Research from multiple disciplines provides evidence that women differ from men with regard to morals and ethics (Borkowski & Ugras, 1998; Jaffee & Hyde, 2000), educational background and expertise (Hillman et al., 2002), and risk preferences (Croson & Gneezy, 2009). In general, women are deemed to be more concerned with social issues (Elm et al., 2001). Moreover, women have different ways of thinking, have superior communication skills, are less prone to suffer from overconfidence, and provide unique resource portfolios, including distinct risk-taking attitudes (Huang & Kisgen, 2013; Jeong & Harrison, 2017), which are likely to predispose them toward a positive attitude toward CSR. A recent meta-analysis—exclusively focusing on women on boards and CSR—found a positive relationship between female directors and CSR (Byron & Post, 2016). However, we deem it meaningful to reexamine this relationship for two reasons. First, we embed this relationship in our meta-analytic path model testing the mediating role of CSR committees. Second, we complement the findings of Byron and Post (2016) by investigating potential differences between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR in our moderator analyses. We state the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3 (H3): Female board representation is positively related to CSR.

# CEO–Chair Duality and CSR

Above, we argued that board independence is likely to be positively related to CSR. One aspect that can undermine a board’s independence is the leadership structure of the board. A CEO that also serves as chair of the board

Endrikat et al. - 9

(i.e., CEO–chair duality) may not be trusted by shareholders to effectively monitor his or her own activities as CEO. CEO–chair duality also induces management entrenchment and thus decreases the monitoring effectiveness of the entire board (Finkelstein & Aveni, 1994). In essence, CEO–chair duality increases information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and strengthens managerial power in the boardroom, as a CEO–chair is able to monopolize board meetings and advance his or her own agenda to the detriment of the firm (de Villiers et al., 2011; Finkelstein & Aveni, 1994). In the context of CSR, this would imply that it is easier for short-term-oriented, profit-maximizing CEOs to advance their own agenda at the expense of long-term CSR-related investments if they are also chair of the board (de Villiers et al., 2011). In contrast, separate CEO and chair positions provide further checks and balances and may prevent that a CEO can divert board attention away from CSR activities that are likely to have longer payback periods (Galbreath, 2018a). We therefore propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 4 (H4): CEO–chair duality is negatively related to CSR.

# Mediating Role of the Presence of a CSR Committee

So far, we have followed the majority of the prior literature and provided arguments for direct relationships between CSR and each board characteristic. However, the relationships between board characteristics and CSR might be more complex than most of the existing research suggests. Some recent articles set out that previous models have been overly parsimonious in that they ignore the possibility of interweaving characteristics and overlook mediating factors that may link board characteristics and firm outcomes (Post & Byron, 2015; Post et al., 2015; Pye & Pettigrew, 2005). We build on this line of thought and examine a more advanced model. In particular, we argue that the presence of a CSR committee may partially mediate the relationships between the other board characteristics and CSR. Thus, board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality may not only have direct effects on CSR but also indirect effects translated into CSR via the presence of a CSR committee.

Specific committees as subgroups of the board have long been neglected by empirical research, but have recently attracted growing attention (S. G. Johnson et al., 2013; Kolev et al., 2019; Neville et al., 2019). These committees, with narrowly defined objectives, such as audit or compensation committees, are deemed to be of significant importance, as many of the critical processes and decisions of boards with regard to a firm’s policy and strategy,

# Business & Society

may derive from them (Dalton et al., 1998; Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Board committees serve a management support function as they enable directors to cope with the limited time that they have available and to deal with the complexity of information (Lorsch & MacIver, 1989). Moreover, equipped with specialized responsibilities and authorities, board committees also serve a monitoring function (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Harrison, 1987).

While firms began to adopt committees focusing on social and environmental issues during the 1970s (Harrison, 1987), recent studies document an increasing number of firms establishing CSR committees (Institute of Business Ethics, 2016; Spitzeck, 2009). The typical activities carried out by CSR committees comprise the creation, implementation, and updating of environmental and social policies, the assessment of a firm’s resource allocation decisions, and the coordination and monitoring of CSR-related issues (Gennari & Salvioni, 2019). That is, CSR committees oversee a firm’s impact on different stakeholders, such as communities, the environment, or employees, but also the specific interests of these groups, and thus can develop opportunities that may generate and protect shareholder value and also serve as a high-level control mechanism preventing downside risk from irresponsible firm behavior (Burke et al., 2019). Paine (2014) illustrates how Nike benefited from its CSR committee, and was transformed from being attacked by labor activists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to pioneering responsibility toward social and environmental issues. In addition, the presence of a CSR committee is a signal of a firm’s commitment and orientation toward CSR for both external stakeholders and organizational members (Mallin & Michelon, 2011; Walls et al., 2012).

We argue that the presence of a CSR committee is likely to mediate the relationships between the other board characteristics and CSR. Thus, board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality may have not only direct effects on CSR but also indirect effects translated into CSR via the presence of a CSR committee. The establishment of a CSR committee is a voluntary and deliberate decision. Unlike compensation and audit committees, which are often mandated (e.g., in the United States), CSR committees are purely voluntary (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Thus, the establishment of a CSR committee can be seen as a conscious strategic decision to actively foster social and environmental responsibility and to explicitly take responsibility for nonshareholding stakeholders’ interests (Eccles et al., 2014). Or in other words, the formation of a CSR committee is a way to institutionalize CSR in a firm (Gennari & Salvioni, 2019). Moreover, several researchers suggest that board committees influence firm outcomes in a more meaningful way than the board as a whole (Daily & Schwenk, 1996; Dalton et al., 1998; Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). That is because the most

Endrikat et al. - 11

important board decisions are taken in a specialized committee rather than at the more general board level (Kesner, 1988). Moreover, by means of a CSR committee, firms explicitly assign responsibility to specific individuals and hold them accountable, also to specific stakeholder groups (Burke et al., 2019). For example, while a higher proportion of females on the board may generally provide the impetus for a proactive CSR strategy, a CSR committee that coordinates and reviews CSR-related activities and proposed investments are more likely to effectively translate general intentions into CSR outcomes. A CSR committee can also serve as a buffer, mitigating potential negative effects of CEO–chair duality on CSR activities. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:

# Hypothesis 5 (H5):

The presence of a CSR committee (partially) mediates the relationships between CSR and board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality.

# Moderators of Board Characteristics–CSR Relationships

Meta-analysis not only determines the overall strength and direction of a relationship but also allows for an examination of potential moderating effects. In this sense, meta-analysis allows the identification of boundary conditions that cannot be explored by primary studies that rely on data within these boundaries. We next hypothesize possible moderators of the focal board characteristics–CSR relationships.

An emerging stream of literature highlights the importance of country-level institutional factors in determining firm strategies and practices (Carney et al., 2011; Heugens et al., 2009). CSR practices and activities have also been shown to be contingent upon institutional settings, such as the legal and political systems, regulatory stringency, and culture (Jain & Jamali, 2016). CSR activities usually affect firm outcomes indirectly via stakeholders’ reactions (H. Wang et al., 2016). Given that stakeholder attitudes vary across countries (Matten & Moon, 2008), it is not surprising that CSR-related relationships vary by country (Ioannou & Serafeim, 2012).

Moreover, previous research has shown that both formal and informal institutional mechanisms significantly determine corporate governance practices and characteristics of the boards of directors (Aguilera & Jackson, 2010; Grosvold, 2011; J. Li & Harrison, 2008). In fact, scholars argue that the mixed empirical findings in corporate governance studies may be due to the neglect of contextual issues (Aguilera et al., 2012; Filatotchev, 2008). In particular, it is argued that certain country-level governance systems, such as

corporate ownership structures, the legal system, and corporate law, significantly determine the effectiveness of corporate governance. This implies that these country-level factors could substitute or complement corporate governance aspects. Mechanisms are substitutes when an increase in one mechanism directly replaces a portion of the other (i.e., functional replacement); in contrast, two mechanisms are complements when an increase in one leads to an increasing effect of the other mechanism (i.e., synergistic effect) (Aguilera et al., 2012). For example, long-term bank-firm relationships, which are typical for Germany and Japan, may effectively substitute for an active market of control (Filatotchev, 2007). Or high levels of blockholder ownership may partially substitute for board independence (Aguilera et al., 2012; Oh et al. (2018)).

One of the key institutional factors affecting corporate governance choices is shareholder protection (La Porta et al., 2000; Leuz et al., 2003). Strong and well enforced legal protection of shareholder rights limits expropriation risks and may decrease the need for boards of directors to monitor and avoids managerial discretion (Villaron-Peramato et al., 2018). Thus, strong shareholder protection might effectively substitute for the monitoring role of corporate boards implying weaker effects of board characteristics on CSR.

However, an alternative argument has been brought forward by Post and Byron (2015). They propose that stronger shareholder protection may provide increased motivation to corporate boards to strive for and take into account the multiple perspectives of board members and to integrate the divergent expertise and values held by different board members (Byron & Post, 2016; Post and Byron, 2015). Hence, shareholder protection is likely to motivate boards to more effectively capitalize on their CSR resources, suggesting that shareholder protection could complement—instead of substitute for—boards characteristics’ impact on CSR. Given the two competing perspectives, we offer a nondirectional hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 6 (H6): A country’s shareholder protection level moderates the relationships between CSR and board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, CEO–chair duality, and the presence of a CSR committee.

Post and Byron’s (2015) meta-analysis on the relationship between female board representation and firm financial performance finds that a country’s level of gender parity significantly moderates the relationship. Byron and Post (2016) show that this country-level factor also moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR. In contexts with greater gender parity (i.e., contexts in which men and women are more similar in terms of

# Endrikat et al.

# 13

education, economic participation, health, and political empowerment, the distribution of power between male and female board members will be more balanced and thus women will be more likely to be heard and considered in decision-making processes (Byron and Post, 2016). In other words, a country’s level of gender parity may complement the positive effect of female board representation on CSR. Because our sample of studies differs from those of Byron and Post (2016) in that we include more recent studies—in particular, studies published after the year 2015, which is the last year covered by Byron and Post (2016)—we deem it necessary to revisit these relationships. We hypothesize the following:

# Hypothesis 7 (H7):

Countries’ gender parity positively moderates the relationship between CSR and female representation on boards.

CSR is a multidimensional construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; H. Wang et al., 2016). Different studies use different measures of overall CSR performance and/or different measures of specific dimensions of CSR. Aggregate measures of CSR subsume dimensions that are not necessarily related to each other, such as environmental performance and social performance (H. Wang et al., 2016). The environmental and social aspects of CSR differ substantially, because environmental issues tend to be more systemic, affect multiple organizational and operational functions, and involve factors that are internally focused (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Russo & Fouts, 1997). Therefore, it is likely that the relationships between board characteristics and CSR systematically differ depending on whether an aggregate measure of CSR is used or whether a measure explicitly focusing on the environmental or the social dimension of CSR is applied in primary studies. Hence, acknowledging the importance of unpacking the dimensions of CSR and to provide a more fine-grained analysis, our final hypothesis is:

# Hypothesis 8 (H8):

The dimension of CSR (aggregate, social, or environmental) moderates the relationships between CSR and the board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, CEO–chair duality, and the presence of a CSR committee.

# Method

# Identification of Studies

We employed three complementary procedures to identify prior empirical studies. First, we conducted a keyword search in the following databases:

# Business & Society 00(0)

Business Source Complete, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Wiley Online Library, using the following search string: (“board” OR “CEO” OR “corporate governance”) AND (“CSR” OR “corporate social” OR “environmental performance” OR “environmental responsibility” OR “sustainability”).

Second, we searched for unpublished manuscripts in the Social Science Research Network database. Third, we employed an ancestry approach (Aguinis et al., 2011) and searched through the reference lists of the studies identified in the preceding steps and in the narrative review of Jain and Jamali (2016) and the meta-analysis of Byron and Post (2016).

To be included in our analysis, studies needed to report a bivariate correlation between our focal board characteristic constructs and a measure of CSR (i.e., a measure of aggregate CSR or the environmental or the social dimension of CSR). The constructs from which correlations are reported did not have to be the main focus of the study (Dalton & Dalton, 2005). This procedure is in line with general meta-analytic practice (Geyskens et al., 2009) and potentially decreases the risk of biased meta-analytic results due to publication bias—the fact that statistically significant results are more likely to have been published (Post & Byron, 2015).

The final set of studies included in our analyses consists of 82 primary studies representing a total of 167,713 observations. These studies were published between the years 1991 and 2019 with a clear trend toward more studies being published in more recent years. The references of the studies used for the meta-analytic calculations are included in the supplemental file available online.

# Coding of Studies

We coded the effect sizes of the focal relationships (i.e., the relationships between board characteristics and CSR), the effect sizes of the relationships between the board characteristics, because we need them for our meta-analytic path models, as well as information needed for our analyses of potential moderating effects. We initially coded a set of studies to establish and validate the coding rules, resolving ambiguous cases and differences in coding through discussion, before reaching consensus (Sleesman et al., 2012). Next, the first author of this study completed the rest of the coding. Finally, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the coding, we had an independent rater (postgraduate in management) that coded approximately one quarter (k = 20) of the studies (Carpenter & Berry, 2017). Apart from some minor discrepancies that were resolved through communicative validation (Kvale, 1995), the overall agreement was high and the calculated Cohen’s Kappa (.92) suggests almost perfect reliability (Landis & Koch, 1977).

# Endrikat et al.

Studies in our sample measured board size as the number of board members. In one study (Bai, 2013), the number of directors was scaled by the size of the organizations. Board independence was measured by means of the number or proportion of outside directors. In cases where studies measured the number, proportion, or ratio of inside directors, we converted the sign of the correlation. The primary studies measured female board representation in different ways. In the majority of studies, the number or proportion of women on boards was used as a measure. Two studies (Jia & Zhang, 2012; Post et al., 2011) used a critical mass measure, which equals 1 if the board consists at least of three women. CEO–chair duality was either measured as binary variable equaling 1 if the CEO also serves as chairperson of the board or in a reverse manner (i.e., a variable that equals 1 if the CEO is not the chairman) (Surroca & Tribo, 2009). In the latter case we converted the sign of the correlation. With regard to the presence of a CSR committee, we conformed to the existing literature (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Mallin & Michelon, 2011) and regarded “environmental committees,” “sustainability committees,” or “corporate ethics committees” as CSR committees. Our focal dependent construct, CSR, was measured in a variety of ways, reflecting its multidimensional nature. Most of the studies in our sample use aggregate measures of CSR combining different environmental and social aspects (e.g., aggregate indices based on the items of the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini [KLD] database). For our moderator analysis, we were primarily interested in potential differences between the environmental and social dimensions of CSR (Bansal et al., 2014). Therefore, we sought to keep these dimensions apart whenever it was possible. In particular, we built composites in the case of studies using different subdimensions of the social dimension of CSR (e.g., community-related CSR measures and employee-related CSR measures) as well as in the case of studies using multiple subdimensions of the environmental dimension of CSR (e.g., measures of waste and measures of toxic waste). Apart from the moderator analysis pertaining to the specific dimension of CSR, we included both effect sizes in our analyses when a study reported correlations for both the environmental and the social dimension. This procedure is in line with other recent meta-analyses (Lander & Heugens, 2017; Mutlu et al., 2018) and is deemed to outperform procedures using only a single effect size according to Bijmolt and Pieters (2001). In cases where studies measured corporate social irresponsibility, such as environmental lawsuits (Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002) or the amount of carbon emissions (Haque, 2017), we converted the sign of the correlation.

Apart from the distinction between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR, we examine two country-level institutional factors as potential moderators. First, with regard to all relationships between board

# Business & Society 00(0)

characteristics and CSR, we explore the influence of shareholder protection strength. Therefore, we coded each study using the value of the investor protection index provided by the World Economic Forum (Schwab, 2018). The index ranges from 0 to 10, with higher index values indicating better shareholder protection, and comprises of three dimensions: (a) the extent to which there is transparency of related-party transactions, (b) the extent to which directors are held liable for self-dealing, and (c) the ease with which shareholders can sue for director misconduct. For single-country studies, we coded the index associated with that country. For studies covering multiple countries (i.e., six or fewer countries), we calculated the average index for those countries. Studies using large multicountry samples were excluded from this moderation analysis. This procedure follows Post and Byron (2015). With regard to the relationship between female representation on boards and CSR, we explore the potential moderating effect of a country-level measure of gender parity. We coded each study using the World Economic Forum’s (2018) gender gap index. This index ranges from 0 to 1 with higher index values indicating greater gender equality in terms of economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. In cases of multicountry samples, we follow the same procedure as we did for the shareholder protection index.

# Meta-Analytic Procedures

We used the software Meta-essentials (Suurmond et al., 2017) and calculated random-effects models assuming the variability between effect sizes is due to sampling error in addition to the variability in the population (Lee et al., 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). In line with prior meta-analyses (Jeong & Harrison, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Lee & Madhavan, 2010) and following Hedges and Vevea (1998), correlations were first transformed using Fisher’s z transformation, because the sample correlation r is not an unbiased estimator of the population r (Dalton & Dalton, 2005; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). Z-transformed correlations have statistical properties of being approximately normally distributed. Furthermore, according to Geyskens and colleagues (2009), this procedure ensures an optimal weighting of effect sizes as the sample variance depends only on sample size and not on the population itself. We computed 95% confidence intervals to assess the significance of the mean effect sizes. A confidence interval that does not include zero indicates that the mean effect size is statistically significant (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). To test the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, we used Q statistics and I2 statistics. The Q statistic represents total dispersion in effect sizes and reflects the need to test moderators when it is significant (Allan et al., 2018; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). The I2 statistic refers to the amount of observed variance.

# Endrikat et al.

that is due to true differences among the studies, rather than error (Allan et al., 2018). Significant heterogeneity suggesting the presence of moderating effects is indicated when the Q statistic is significant and the I2 statistic suggests that there is a significant amount of variance attributed to true differences (i.e., I greater than 75%) (Allan et al., 2018)2.

One potential problem of meta-analysis is the file drawer problem, also called publication bias, which refers to circumstances in which “the research that appears in the published literature is systematically unrepresentative of the population of completed studies” (Rothstein et al., 2005, p. 1). This might occur when the decision to submit or publish studies is influenced by the magnitude, direction, or significance of the study’s findings in such a way that findings that, for instance, are not statistically significant are less likely to be published (Geyskens et al., 2009). We addressed this issue by calculating the fail-safe N that provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to render the mean effect insignificant (Rosenthal, 1979).

We used the meta-analytically derived mean correlations between board characteristics and CSR, as well as the intercorrelations among the board characteristics, to conduct meta-analytic path analysis (Bergh et al., 2016; Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995). For this purpose, we used the meta-analytic correlation matrix as input for MPlus 8.2. Consistent with prior studies, we used the harmonic mean sample size from the correlation matrix as the sample size for our analysis (Allan et al., 2018; Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Meta-analytic path modeling allows us to examine simultaneously the relationships among the board characteristics and with CSR. Moreover, it enables us to test H6 about the (partial) mediation of the presence of a CSR committee.

For examining our hypotheses regarding potential moderating effects, we used random-effects meta-regression analyses (Jeong & Harrison, 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001), in which the dependent variable is the meta-analytically derived mean correlation for a certain relationship and the independent variables are the suggested moderators. A significant beta coefficient suggests that the examined factor moderates the focal relationship.

support for H1. In H2, we predicted a positive relationship between board independence and CSR. The meta-analytic effect size is positive and statistically significant (r = .108; 95% CI = [.062, .153]), thus supporting H2. Also H3, predicting a positive relationship between female board representation and CSR, receives empirical support (r = .203; 95% CI = [.159, .247]). Regarding the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR (H4), we suggested a negative relationship. The small and non-significant mean correlation (r = .020; 95% CI = [−.020, .060]) does not support this hypothesis.

For all significant relationships, the calculated fail-safe N suggests robustness of our findings in terms of a bias against the publication of null findings. The number of null-effect findings that would be needed to overturn the relationships are all above the tolerance level suggested by Rosenthal (1979).

The Q statistics and the I2 statistics reject the assumption of homogeneity for hypotheses H1 to H4. Thus, moderator analyses are warranted for all of these board characteristics–CSR relationships.

# Meta-Analytic Path Model Results

Table 2 shows the meta-analytic correlation matrix used as input to test our meta-analytic path model. We test a model (displayed in Figure 1) in which the presence of a CSR committee partially mediates the relationships between CSR and the other board characteristics: board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality. We allow those board characteristics, which displayed significant mean correlations in the meta-analytic correlation matrix (Table 2), to covary with each other. As reported in Table 3, the model fits the data in an acceptable manner (comparative fit index [CFI] = .958, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .056, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .022) and all paths are significant, except the path linking CEO–chair duality to CSR directly and the path linking CEO–chair duality to the presence of a CSR committee.

The indirect effects on CSR that are channeled through the presence of a CSR committee are significant for board size (β = .023; p < .001), board independence (β = .014; p < .001), and female board representation (β = .030; p < .001). Thus, H5 is supported suggesting a partial mediation of the presence of a CSR committee, except for CEO–chair duality, which is neither directly (β = .002; p = .708) nor indirectly related to CSR (β = .001; p = .242) and is also not significantly related to the presence of a CSR committee (β = .007; p = .241).

# Meta-Regression Results

To test our hypotheses concerning potentially moderating effects, we estimated random-effects meta-regression models. Table 4 reports the results. Regarding H6, concerning the influence of countries’ shareholder protection strength, we find significantly negative effects regarding the relationships between board size (β = −.489; p < .001) and CSR and board independence and CSR (β = −.466; p < .001) (i.e., the positive relationships are significantly weaker in countries with stronger levels of shareholder protection).

In H7, we hypothesized that countries’ level of gender parity moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR. Our results...

show a significantly positive effect (β = .542; p < .001), providing evidence that the relationship between female board representation and CSR is more positive for firms in countries with greater gender parity. This result is in line with the finding of Byron and Post (2016).

Our hypothesis H8 was about possible differences in the relationships depending on whether the environmental or the social dimension of CSR is examined. To test this hypothesis, we included dummy variables in the regression models taking the value of 1 when the measurement of CSR in the study focused on the environmental dimension of CSR (or social dimension respectively) and 0 in the case of aggregate CSR measures. We find that an exclusive focus on the environmental dimension significantly weakens the relationship between board size and CSR (β = −.359; p = .002) and the relationship between female board representation and CSR (β = −.301; p = .054). We also find that an exclusive focus on the social dimension significantly strengthens the relationship between board independence and CSR (β = .208; p = .073), and the relationship between female board representation and CSR (β = .347; p = .013), but weakens the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR (β = −.253; p = .051). However, given that we found that the CEO–chair duality—CSR relationship is not significant, this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Questions. In addition, prior research typically relied on simple models that fail to account for possible interrelationships between different board characteristics and ignore mediating mechanisms that might be at play. Finally, very little attention has as yet been paid to potential boundary conditions of the relationships. Our meta-analytic study clarifies several of those issues.

# Joint Effects of Board Characteristics on CSR and Mediating Role of the Presence of a CSR Committee

Our results show that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR. Thus, we find empirical support for our arguments based on a combination of agency theory and resource dependence theory, suggesting that boards influence CSR by way of their monitoring function and their resource provision function (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003). Furthermore, our meta-analytic path model suggests that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR.

# Business & Society 00(0)

Representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are partially interrelated with each other (i.e., board size with female board representation and board independence with female board representation) and jointly influence CSR (i.e., operate in conjunction, Jain & Jamali, 2016). Hence, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting the need for future studies to use more complex models that acknowledge these joint effects. Studies that fail to account for the interrelatedness of board characteristics risk to provide inaccurate estimates and erroneous inferences about the relationships under study. Therefore, we strongly encourage research to take a more holistic approach and to examine how board characteristics operate as a complex nexus or a bundle of complements and substitutes. Although this “bundle of governance mechanisms” perspective harks back to Rediker and Seth (1995), to our best knowledge, only Oh and colleagues (2018) have applied this insight in a CSR context. In terms of methodology, qualitative comparative analysis can be a meaningful approach, which has recently been applied by Misangyi and Acharya (2014). This approach would allow disentangling possible manifestations of board characteristics that combine effectively with each other (Misangyi and Acharya, 2014).

Furthermore, our research adds to the literature that suggests that board committees may be more meaningful predictors of firm outcomes than the board characteristics themselves (Daily, 1994; Dalton et al., 1998; Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Our evidence that the presence of a CSR committee channels the impacts of board size, board independence, and female board representation on CSR shows the importance of board committees in general and CSR committees in particular. Many critical board processes and decisions take place in committees (Dalton et al., 1998; Kesner, 1988). Especially where specialized knowledge and complex decisions are involved, such as CSR, dedicated committees enable boards to function more effectively (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Therefore, in line with Neville and colleagues (2019) for instance, we contend that a more explicit focus on characteristics at the committee-level, instead of the board-level, may provide a more nuanced understanding. In sum, future research should further disentangle the interplay between board characteristics, board committees, and CSR.

# Insignificant Relationship of CEO–Chair Duality

Our finding of an insignificant relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR suggests that CEO–chair duality per se neither fosters nor undermines CSR. Thus, while CEO–chair duality is among the most widely examined aspects in corporate governance research and is of continuing interest to shareholder activists and institutional investors (Dalton & Dalton, 2011; Dalton

# Endrikat et al.

et al., 1998), we find no generalizable evidence for an effect on CSR. CEO–chairs with positive attitudes toward social and environmental issues may use their power to promote CSR, while CEOs who do not regard CSR as important or who lack CSR expertise may undermine CSR. Thus, our study may encourage future research to go beyond the coarse-grained duality construct and examine more specific CEO attributes, such as education, experience, or values and beliefs, and whether the CEO–chairs are founders, heirs, or professional managers (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Siegel, 2014; Tang et al., 2015, 2018).

# Moderating Effects in the Relationships Between Board Characteristics and CSR

Our study also sheds light on potential boundary conditions that may alter the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. First, we show that a country’s shareholder protection strength weakens the positive effects of board size and board independence on CSR (i.e., in contexts associated with higher levels of accountability and liability of the board), CSR is well managed by most companies, and therefore, board characteristics do not have a major impact. These findings suggest that high levels of legal and regulatory shareholder protection can substitute for positive board-level impacts on CSR, which is in line with the literature that emphasizes the need to consider the role of the institutional context in corporate governance research (Aguilera et al., 2012; Yoshikawa et al., 2014). Future research that examines this substitution hypothesis more comprehensively would be a worthy pursuit.

We also investigated gender parity as a country-level moderator and our finding confirms previous meta-analytic evidence (Byron & Post, 2016; Post & Byron, 2015). Our findings show that a country’s level of gender parity reinforces or complements the positive effect that women on boards have on CSR (i.e., women on boards can best accomplish higher levels of CSR in countries where they enjoy greater equality in terms of economic participation, educational attainment, or political empowerment). Future research may seek to explore how much of the positive effect of female board representation is due to the superior resources (i.e., knowledge and experience) that women may bring in countries with greater gender equality, compared with other contexts; how much is due to their different values and beliefs; and how much is due to the fact that women, even those on boards, may be less powerful in countries with greater inequality.

Finally, our moderator analysis reveals that the board characteristic relationships are stronger for the social dimension of CSR and weaker for the environmental dimension. Environmental issues are often more technical.

# Business & Society 00(0)

than social matters and thus require firms to focus on science and to implement technological solutions to production processes (Bansal et al., 2014). These technical solutions to environmental concerns often rely on internal processes, whereas approaches regarding social concerns tend to be more dependent on the actions of external stakeholders (Bansal et al., 2014). Thus, the CSR-related resource provision role of directors via larger boards and specific committees may be more conducive to the social dimension of CSR than the environmental dimension. The stronger relationship between female directors and the social dimension compared with the environmental dimension might be explained by a generally stronger propensity of women to focus on social issues that can be seen as “soft issues” in contrast to environmental issues that tend to be more technical in nature (Rao & Tilt, 2016). Acknowledging that both broad and specific theories and insights are desirable (Edwards, 2001; Weick, 1979), we encourage researchers to use both aggregated and disaggregated measures to provide further insights.

# Limitations and Additional Future Research Directions

In common with all studies, there are several limitations that should be noted and which potentially indicate future research opportunities. First, our reliance on meta-analytic path modeling does not allow us to explore the interrelatedness of board characteristics by introducing interaction terms or using conditional correlation approaches. We encourage primary studies to explore these interactions.

Second, different studies use different measures for CSR. The environmental dimension is sometimes measured at a very specific operational level (e.g., by means of data from the Toxic Release Inventory of the Environmental Protection Agency, or by water productivity measures), and at other times in generic terms based on ratings, such as the MSCI KLD database. Similarly, the social dimension is measured in diverse ways, sometimes using MSCI KLD data, or at other times philanthropic activities outside the firm, such as charitable contributions. We were unable to analyze the effects of different measures in detail, which might be a fruitful avenue for further research.

Finally, meta-analyses are inherently limited in testing causality (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Should primary studies employ time lags between the dependent and independent variables, a meta-analysis could—to some extent—infer causality (Endrikat et al., 2014). However, this is not the case for our sample of primary studies. As it is likely that certain board characteristics manifest their effects on CSR only after a certain period of time, addressing temporal effects could be a fruitful avenue for future research.

# Conclusion

This meta-analysis addresses the current state of research concerning the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. We show that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee positively relate to CSR. As regards the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR, we do not find a significant effect. Thus, our study helps to reconcile mixed evidence provided by primary studies. Moreover, we provide evidence consistent with the views that (a) board size, board independence, and female board representation jointly determine CSR and (b) the presence of a CSR committee mediates these relationships. In this regard, our study adds to the recent literature promoting more holistic approaches in studying board characteristics. Finally, we highlight important boundary conditions that alter the focal relationships. Our results suggest that macro-contextual factors such as countries’ investor protection strength and gender parity act as moderators. In particular, we find that stronger shareholder protection in a country weakens the positive effects of board size and board independence on CSR—consistent with the view that countries’ investor protection mechanisms substitute for these board characteristics—and that greater gender parity at the country level strengthens the positive relationship between female board representation and CSR—consistent with the view that countries’ gender parity complement females on boards’ positive impact on CSR. Moreover, our findings show that the relationships depend upon the specific CSR dimension examined (i.e., social vs. environmental dimension). Specifically, the relationships are more positive with regard to the social dimension of CSR (i.e., for board independence and for female board representation) and weaker for the environmental dimension (i.e., for board size, for female board representation, and for the presence of a CSR committee). By providing evidence on these boundary conditions, our study also contributes to theory development.

# Notes

1. Two meta-analyses integrated the empirical body of knowledge in this regard. Dalton and colleagues (1998) examined the relationship between board composition aspects (i.e., inside/outside director proportions and affiliated/independent director proportions) and financial performance as well as the relationship between board leadership structure (i.e., duality of CEO/chairperson roles) and financial performance. For each case, they found no evidence of a substantial relationship. Dalton and colleagues (1999) meta-analytically examined the relationship between board size and financial performance and found a significant positive relationship.
2. The studies included in our analyses operationalize corporate social responsibility (CSR) mostly by means of CSR ratings such as the Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD) rating. Thus, the measures provide a mix of outcome- and process-based CSR.
3. Our general reasoning for distinguishing between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR in our moderator analysis is provided later on in the article. In short, environmental issues are more technical in nature, while social issues to a greater degree involve moral and ethical reasoning aspects. Therefore, the effect of female board representation might differ with regard to the specific dimensions of CSR.
4. Both perspectives—the substitution perspective and the complementarity perspective—are represented in recent corporate governance research and the empirical evidence is ambiguous (Misangyi & Acharya, 2014; Oh et al., 2018; Rediker & Seth, 1995; Ward et al., 2009).
5. Gender parity as a potential moderator makes only sense for the relationship between female board representation and CSR, but not for the other focal relationships. Therefore, H7 exclusively pertains to female board representation.
6. The creation of a composite correlation results in a more construct valid measure of the construct of interest (Higgins et al., 2003; Ones & Viswesvaran, 1996).
7. According to Rosenthal (1979), the file drawer tolerance is set at 5X + 10, where X is the number of available effect sizes.
8. We also compared our results with a baseline model, in which all of the board characteristics—also the presence of a CSR committee—are directly related to CSR (i.e., a one-to-one direct model). This model showed a slightly inferior fit to the data as indicated by the fit indices and the chi-square difference test was non-significant.
9. As robustness tests, we also estimate meta-regressions without the effect sizes for which we had to calculate the average due to multiple countries in the primary study sample. In all cases the results remained qualitatively similar.
10. With regard to the relationship between the presence of a CSR committee and CSR, only one study was available exclusively focusing on the social dimension, thus not allowing a meaningful analysis.

# ABSTRACT

Manuscript Type: Empirical

# Research Question/Issue

We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists’ motivations for achieving their objectives.

# Research Findings/Insights

Based on a sample of U.S. S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially-motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially-motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations.

# Theoretical/Academic Implications

Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists’ underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations.

# Practitioner/Policy Implications

Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the U.S.

# INTRODUCTION

We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors (BOD) and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. These questions are motivated by recent initiatives by numerous international legislative, regulatory, and advocacy organizations directed toward addressing female underrepresentation on corporate boards. Norway was the first country to introduce a quota of 40 percent for its corporate boards, and as of 2013 at least ten countries have established legal quotas requiring a minimum percentage of women directors on corporate boards, ranging from 30 percent (in Germany)1 to 50 percent (in Israel)2. The European Union (EU), Brazil, Canada (Quebec), India, and the Philippines have similar legislation proposed or pending3. In addition, regulatory bodies in at least 20 countries have instituted “comply-or-explain” rules to encourage greater gender diversity on corporate boards. For example, firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) are required to establish measurable objectives for achieving BOD gender diversity and annually assess their progress in achieving them or explain why they have not done so, and in the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to disclose whether and how its nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for directors. Advocacy organizations, such as Catalyst and 2020 Women on Boards, have also pressed for voluntary improvements in board diversity.

Concurrent with the above broad-based approaches, there has also been an increase in shareholder activism devoted to greater board diversity in recent years, particularly in the U.S., where shareholders have initiated more than 250 proposals targeting individual firms to increase female representation on corporate boards since 1997 – over 30 proposals were filed in 2013 alone. In addition, diversity resolutions filed in the U.S. in 2013 received the highest average vote (35.8 percent) among environmental and social governance categories, with

shareholder campaigns driven, in part, by the work of the advocacy group Thirty Percent Coalition. Due to their non-binding nature, shareholder proposals in the U.S. have historically been viewed as a weak mechanism to drive governance reform (Bebchuk, 2005), and while firms have been more responsive to shareholder proposals in recent years, Thomas and Cotter (2007) document that even in cases where the proposal receives a majority vote by shareholders, only 25 percent of proposals in their sample are implemented by the board. In addition, the effectiveness of shareholder proposals in improving board gender diversity has not been examined in the prior literature. It thus becomes an open empirical question as to whether shareholder proposals represent an effective means of achieving desired changes in the gender diversity of corporate boards.

We address this gap in the literature using a sample of U.S. shareholder proposals related to board gender diversity drawn from the RiskMetrics database over the period 1997 to 2011. We examine the effect of shareholder activism on board gender diversity using a one-to-one matched-sample design, taking advantage of the natural experiment created when shareholder activists target a firm for increased female representation on its corporate board. We focus our analysis on U.S. firms because proposal submissions are far more frequent in the U.S. than in other countries (Cziraki, Renneboog & Szilagyi, 2010; Judge, Gaur, & Muller-Kahle, 2010). Furthermore, the U.S. has not yet taken legislative action to address corporate governance gender imbalances, creating an opportunity for shareholder activists to intervene.

While prior literature examining the effectiveness of shareholder proposals has generated mixed results (Goranova & Ryan, 2014), we document that firms targeted by shareholder proposals calling for increased gender diversity on corporate boards experience significantly greater improvements in female board representation, relative to a matched control sample of non-targeted firms. The result from this natural experiment holds in both.

Univariate comparisons, as well as in a cross-sectional regression analysis that controls for other potential determinants of shareholder activism and board gender diversity. Therefore, our findings suggest that shareholder activism is an effective mechanism for increasing female representation on boards. We thus contribute to the corporate governance literatures on both shareholder proposals and board gender diversity by providing, to our knowledge, the first systematic evidence on the effectiveness of shareholder activism in improving female board representation. The paper also speaks to the call for research on alternative efforts to increase board diversity beyond legislative quotas, as voiced by Adams, de Haan, Terjesen, & van Ees (2015). Understanding the potential mechanisms for increasing board diversity is important as significant changes are not likely to occur quickly through organic processes.

We also examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to board gender diversity, considering the perspectives offered by both agency and institutional theory in our analysis. We find that activists target firms with significantly lower female board representation and firms with less independent boards. We also extend Judge et al. (2010) by conditioning our analysis on shareholder activists’ underlying motivations. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we characterize our sample of proposals as either financially- or socially-motivated based on activist type. We find that socially-motivated shareholder activists target firms with significantly higher levels of board female representation compared to financially-motivated activists, consistent with institutional theory predictions. These insights underscore Judge et al. (2010) recommendation that activist motivation should be taken into account in future research related to shareholder proposals. In addition, while we observe larger percentage increases in female board representation for firms targeted by financially-motivated activists, our statistical tests reveal that financially-motivated and socially-motivated shareholder proposals are equally effective in increasing board gender representation.

diversity. We thus conclude that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for achieving corporate governance objectives irrespective of activists’ underlying motivations.

However, we note that mean female board representation for firms two years after being targeted – 6 percent (10 percent) for firms targeted with financially-motivated (socially-motivated) proposals – remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups, suggesting that legislative action may still be necessary to achieve current corporate board diversity goals in the U.S.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the theoretical perspectives and prior literature related to board gender diversity and shareholder activism and develop our hypotheses regarding the antecedents of gender diversity-related shareholder activism and its effectiveness. We then describe our research methodology and present our empirical findings. Discussion and conclusions are provided in the final section.

# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES

Our research question addressing the antecedents and ultimate effectiveness of shareholder activism directed toward increasing corporate board gender diversity brings together two disparate streams of the corporate governance literature. However, both the board diversity literature and the shareholder activism literature have shared a reliance on two central theoretical perspectives to structure their investigations – agency theory and institutional theory. We therefore draw on both theoretical perspectives in our literature review and in developing our hypotheses.

# Board Composition and Diversity

# Agency Theory Perspectives

Agency theory (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) is arguably the dominant theoretical framework used within corporate governance research. It stems from

The separation between ownership (shareholders) and control (managers). This separation provides an opportunity for managers (agents) to act in their own self-interest by maximizing their own utility at the expense of the owners (principals).

From an agency theory perspective, the role of corporate boards is to monitor managers on behalf of shareholders, ensuring that shareholders’ interests are pursued (Eisenhardt, 1989). Agency theory recognizes that board incentives to monitor on behalf of shareholders will vary, and board independence, in particular, is viewed as a key attribute in gauging monitoring incentives (Weisbach, 1988). Boards consisting mostly of insiders or dependent outside directors are expected to be less effective at monitoring than independent boards, whose incentives are not compromised through connection with the firm. Empirical evidence attempting to establish this supposed link through improved firm performance, however, is decidedly mixed (e.g. Aguilera, Desender, Bedar, & Lee, 2015; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand, & Johnson, 1998; Dalton, Hitt, Certo, & Dalton, 2007).

This line of inquiry has been extended to examine the role of board gender diversity in creating an effective monitoring environment. For example, in a sample of U.S. firms, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find that female directors have better attendance records than male directors, male directors have fewer attendance problems the more gender-diverse the board is, and women are more likely to join monitoring committees. They conclude that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. In addition, Schwartz-Ziv (2015) finds that boards that are more-gender-balanced (that is, have at least three directors of each gender) are more active than other boards, being more likely to request additional information and take initiative, such as proposing an action be taken. Others document associations between board gender diversity and a lower likelihood of earnings restatements and securities fraud (Abbott, Parker, & Presley, 2012; Cumming, Leung, & Rui, 2015), as well as higher.

# Stock Price Informativeness and Earnings Quality

While these findings suggest that board gender diversity appears to improve overall monitoring, evidence linking gender diversity to firm outcomes, especially firm performance, is more equivocal. For example, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find that CEO turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and that directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards, but that the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. Similarly mixed findings are reported by Carter, D'Souza, Simkins, & Simpson (2010), who report in their review of this literature that out of seven papers examining the link between gender diversity and firm performance, two find a positive relationship, three find no relationship, and two find a negative relationship.

Overall, the agency theory perspective provides consistent evidence of improved monitoring from gender diverse boards, but has not established a clear link between that improved monitoring and firm performance.

# Institutional Theory Perspectives

Institutional theory considers the processes by which structures, including schemas, rules, norms, and routines, become established as authoritative guidelines for social behavior. Within this framework, firms can be regarded as consisting of cognitive, normative, and regulative structures and activities that give meaning to social behavior. An important central assumption of this theory is that concerns regarding social legitimacy take precedence over those of economic efficiency or performance (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Scott, 2001).

From an institutional theory perspective, firms’ pursuit of social legitimacy rather than shareholder wealth ultimately leads to organizational homogenization (or isomorphism) with regard to their most visible attributes, such as board composition. Board composition will thus be determined through the prevailing organizational norms in the field; i.e., boards.

of organizations in the same institutional set will tend to be more similar to each other than to the boards of organizations outside of their set (Lynall, Golden, & Hillman, 2003). One such example of cross-country institutional isomorphism is the policy diffusion process that has taken place in Scandinavia and Europe with regard to mandating corporate board gender quotas, following Norway’s legal adoption of 40 percent quotas in 2004. A similar process occurred in the New Zealand Stock Exchange after the ASX changed its corporate governance guidelines in 2010, requiring listed companies to adopt and disclose their diversity policies (Payne & Phillips, 2014).

At the firm level, the quest for social legitimacy yields predictions for board composition. For example, prior research on organizational legitimacy implies that larger and more visible firms experience more pressure to conform to societal expectations and that elaborate relational networks among organizations and their members increase the need for greater social legitimacy (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). In addition, because having females on a corporate board can provide legitimacy in the eyes of firms’ potential and current employees, industries with a large female employment base are expected to have higher levels of female representation on boards of directors. Consistent with these predictions, Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella (2007) provide empirical evidence that larger firms and firms operating in industries with large female employment bases are significantly more likely to have at least one female board member. They also find that firms with female directors are more organizationally complex and have more directors who sit on other boards with female directors, consistent with predictions from institutional theory.

There is also evidence that greater gender diversity of corporate boards yields positive social legitimacy outcomes. For example, Bear, Rahman, & Post (2010) document that board gender diversity is positively associated with firms’ corporate social responsibility rankings and firm reputation as measured using Fortune Magazine’s “Most Admired Companies” list.

Further, Bernardi, Bosco, & Columb (2009) find that the board gender diversity of Fortune 500 companies is positively associated with the firm being listed on Ethisphere Magazine's “World's Most Ethical Companies” list.

# Shareholder Activism

Shareholder activism is defined by Sjostrom (2008) as “the use of ownership position to actively influence company policy and practice.” Although activism encompasses activities such as letter writing, proxy battles, litigation, publicity campaigns, discussions with corporate managers, and participating in shareholder meetings (Aguilera, Desender, Bedar, & Lee, 2015), most corporate governance research related to shareholder activism focuses on the filing of shareholder proposals, a written recommendation that a shareholder formally submits to a publicly traded company, advocating that the company take a particular course of action. Under SEC rules, any shareholder holding shares worth at least $2,000 (or one percent of the market value of equity) for a year or more is allowed to submit a proposal for inclusion in a company’s proxy statement distributed for its annual shareholder meeting.

Gillan and Starks (2007) provide a summary of the history of shareholder activism and document the increasing prevalence and importance of shareholder proposals as a means of shaping corporate governance.

While in the past shareholders had typically targeted firms that were underperforming or poorly governed (Karpoff, Malatesta, & Walking, 1996), shareholder activism more recently addresses perceived deficiencies in corporate social responsibilities, including issues related to the environment, corporate political activities, or human rights violations. Increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards is one such social issue that activists have pursued with increasing frequency, with over 75 shareholder proposals calling for greater diversity filed since 2013.

As mentioned above, both agency theory and institutional theory have been brought to bear on questions related to shareholder activism. A prime example is Judge et al. (2010), who demonstrate in a multi-country study that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary with the motivation of the activist, with agency theory providing valid predictions for financially-motivated activism and institutional theory providing stronger explanations for socially-motivated activism. We thus draw upon both theoretical perspectives in developing our hypotheses.

# The Antecedents of Shareholder Activism Related to Gender Diversity

Prior research has examined the firm characteristics of female board representation. For example, Hillman et al. (2007) find that firms with female directors are larger and more organizationally complex, have more directors who sit on other boards with female directors, and are in industries with a higher proportion of women in the workforce, and Adams and Ferreira (2009) report that firms with female directors are larger, have more business segments, have larger boards, have worse performance in terms of Tobin’s Q (market value of assets over book value of assets) but better performance in terms of return on assets (ROA). However, we are the first, to our knowledge, to examine the antecedents of shareholder activism directed toward increasing female board representation. We therefore start with the most fundamental question of whether the existing level of female representation on the BOD plays a role in activists’ decisions to formally submit proposals calling for increased gender diversity.

It would seem self-evident that shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity will tend to target firms with low existing levels of female board representation, as activists target firms where problems are perceived as greatest and where the potential benefits of change are perceived as being high (Ertimur, Ferri, & Muslu, 2011). Because firms with low

female presentation would stand out relative to their peers, we expect them to be more likely to be targeted by shareholder activists than firms with high female representation. However, shareholder activists driven by ideological concerns may be less discriminating in their choice of target firms. In the extreme, such activists might target all firms where there is any gender imbalance on the board, which would constitute virtually all firms in the S&P 1500.

Financially-motivated activists may only be pursuing gender diversity goals merely to satisfy demands from clients rather than from a sincere desire to impact board composition, in which case the existing level of representation may not be the primary factor in choosing a target. To the extent that these alternative possibilities hold, this will attenuate the expected relation between existing female representation and shareholder activism, potentially resulting in no association between the two. We nonetheless offer a directional hypothesis related to existing female representation:

# Hypothesis 1a.

Higher existing levels of female board representation reduce the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity.

We further consider how activist motivations might affect the relation between the level of female representation and the likelihood of being targeted. Within the institutional theory framework, increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards would increase the firm’s social legitimacy and is thus typically viewed as a socially-motivated shareholder activist objective. However, the agency theory perspective on board diversity suggests that financially-motivated activists would also have an interest in improving gender diversity, as there is empirical evidence (cited above) that suggests that the presence of female directors improves the board’s ability to effectively monitor the firm’s managers. These findings are also consistent with Cohen, Pant, & Sharp (1998), who provide evidence that women display a higher ethical sensitivity – i.e., they are more likely to identify a questionable action as unethical, and less likely to engage in that action. In addition, Hillman (2015) argues that innate differences between men and women can improve board functioning, and Lee and

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Farh (2004) find that diverse groups are more innovative and identify a broader set of alternatives for consideration, improving decision-making efficacy. Hence we expect both financially- and socially-motivated activists to campaign for increased gender diversity.

However, we expect that socially-motivated activists would have a higher benchmark for what they view as an “acceptable” level of female representation, as achievement of their social legitimacy goals would presumably require more than the token presence of a female director. To illustrate, consider a board with, say, 14 percent female directors, which is the average level of representation for S&P 1500 firms in 2013. This level of representation may be deemed as adequate by financially-motivated activists, but would fall short of the more ambitious goals of 20 percent or 30 percent female representation that have been set by advocacy organizations such as 2020 Women on Board, Catalyst of the Thirty Percent Coalition. In this instance, we would expect socially-motivated activists to still target firms for improvement if that firm had a level of “only” 14 percent representation, but financially-motivated activists may not bother because this level may be adequate in terms of achieving the monitoring benefits that gender diversity provides to firms. In other words, we expect higher existing levels of female representation for socially-motivated than for financially-motivated activists. If this is the case, then the predicted inverse relation posited in H1a will be weakened for socially-motivated activists and strengthened for financially-motivated activists. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 1b.

The effect of existing levels of female board representation on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.

Our second hypothesis considers whether the existing degree of board independence influences the likelihood that a firm will be targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. Sonnenfeld (2002) argues that board members should be able to challenge other’s assumptions and beliefs to resist the often-strong pressure to conform with

management and other board members, but concludes that “groupthink” is relatively common in boardrooms. Janis (1972) argues that a group is especially vulnerable to “groupthink” when its members are similar, and that increased diversity improves the problem. Similarly, Milliken & Martins (1996) find that diversity reduces “groupthink”, status quo bias, and other group-based decision biases, and Schwartz-Ziv (2015) finds that CEOs are more likely to be held accountable if the board includes a critical mass of women directors. Carter et al. (2003) find that the percentage of women directors is negatively associated with the number of company insiders; similarly, Kang, Chang, & Grav (2007) report that gender diversity is positively associated with board independence in Australian firms. Because women are more likely to be independent directors – outsiders to the firm but also less similar to male board members – shareholder activists concerned about a lack of board independence may encourage greater gender diversity as an indirect means of improving independence. An alternative view is that shareholders concerned about increasing board independence could pursue that goal directly without resorting to an indirect route involving gender diversity. Also, Ertimur et al. (2011) find that activists target firms with more independent boards with compensation-related proposals. We nonetheless predict a negative relation between board independence and the likelihood of being the target of a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 2a.

Higher existing levels of board independence reduce the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity.

We again consider how activist motivation might affect this relation. Under the agency theory perspective, it is assumed that independent boards are more effective at monitoring managers and aligning their interests with those of shareholders. For example, Carleton, Nelson, & Weisbach (1998) find that TIAA-CREF views board diversity as a corporate governance issue because they believe that a diverse board is less likely to be beholden to management, hence alleviating potential agency problems within the firm.

(2002) finds that board independence is negatively associated with earnings management, which suggests that independent boards are more effective in monitoring the corporate financial reporting process, and Carter et al. (2003) document a positive relation with board independence and firm value as measured using Tobin’s Q. We therefore expect that financially-motivated activists, who are typically governed by agency concerns, to have a strong preference for board independence. From an institutional theory perspective, however, board independence is not typically a matter of social legitimacy; thus socially-motivated activists would be less driven by this concern. We thus predict that the association between board independence and the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is intensified for financially-motivated activists than socially-motivated activists. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 2b.

The effect of existing levels of board independence on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.

# The Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism

The effectiveness of shareholder activism has received considerable attention in the literature, and findings regarding their effectiveness are mixed. A shareholder proposal can either be withdrawn by the activist if a concession is made by management, or can go to a shareholder vote if no concession is made. For proposals that are withdrawn, there is the risk that management has merely made a symbolic offer or paid “lip service” to temporarily placate the activist (Landier & Nair, 2009). For proposals that go to a vote by shareholders at the annual general meeting, the resulting vote is nonbinding, and therefore proposals resulting in a majority vote do not necessarily result in action by management. Therefore, the effectiveness of activists is by no means a foregone conclusion. On the other hand, a majority vote can send a strong signal to management, spurring them to action.

Early studies conclude that there is little evidence that shareholder proposals create value and that they have only a limited impact on firm governance structures (Karpoff, 2001), but some of the more recent studies document that shareholder proposals are having an impact (Goranova & Ryan, 2014; Aguilera et al., 2015). Thomas and Cotter (2007) find that seven percent of shareholder proposals filed between 2002 and 2004 on governance issues such as executive compensation and corporate control are adopted by the board. Ertimur, Ferri, and Stubben (2010) find that proposals that receive a majority vote are more likely to be adopted, especially in more recent years. They report that 22.4 percent of majority-vote proposals are adopted in 1997-2001, but that this frequency increases to 36.9 percent over 2002-2004. However, this still represents a small fraction of proposals filed, as only 18.0 percent and 31.7 percent of proposals receive majority-votes during those respective time periods. Ertimur et al. (2010) also report that proposals related to board composition have the lowest rates of implementation, following shareholder rights and executive pay.

With particular regard to proposals related to environmental/social issues, Reid and Toffel (2009) find that firms are more likely to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project if they are targeted by environmental shareholder proposals. In contrast, David, Bloom, & Hillman (2007) find that corporate social performance proposals are negatively related to subsequent corporate social performance.

However, given the more recent evidence on the growing effectiveness of shareholder activism and the increased attention on gender diversity issues, we expect proposals to have some measurable impact on female board representation. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 3a.

There is a significant increase in female board representation after a firm has been targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity.

As with H1 and H2, we again consider how activist motivations might affect our prediction. Gillan and Starks (2000) find that proposals sponsored by institutional investors received significantly more favorable votes than those sponsored by independent individuals.

or religious organizations. Similarly, Renneboog and Szilagyi (2009) find that proposals submitted by public pension funds and investment firms garner the most votes compared to unions, religious groups and individual investors. Ertimur et al. (2010) report that proposals initiated by religious organizations have the lowest majority-vote and implementation rates relative to other activist types.

As we discuss below, we categorize public pension funds and investment firms as financially-motivated, and religious groups and individuals as socially-motivated. To the extent that weak voting support represents a misalignment of activist interest to the interests of the average firm shareholder (Gillan & Starks, 2007), we would expect proposals by the socially-motivated investor groups to be less effective in changing management behavior. Further, if financially-motivated activists do target firms with lower female representation, as predicted in Hypothesis 1b, management may feel greater pressure to improve performance on this dimension. We therefore predict the following:

# Hypothesis 3b.

The increase in female board representation after a firm has been targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is lower (higher) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.

# RESEARCH METHOD

Details of our sample selection process are reported in Table 1. We obtain 182 shareholder proposals related to board diversity for S&P 1500 firms over the 1997-2011 period from RiskMetrics. Ending our sample period in 2011 allows us to analyze subsequent board appointments for two years following the target year. We consider both proposals that went to vote (64) and those that did not (118). Proposals may be withdrawn for two primary reasons: they may be omitted or withdrawn. Omitted proposals result when the SEC grants exclusion of the proposal because of ineligibility (typically if the proposal is vague, false or misleading, the proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations, the proposal...

is contrary to applicable law, a duplicate proposal exists, or on procedural grounds such as the defects in the shareholder’s proof of ownership. A proposal is withdrawn by the submitting shareholder when the firm and submitting shareholder have reached some form of agreement prior to the proposal going to vote (Carleton et al., 1998). Because withdrawn proposals often result in concessions by companies to activists, we include them in our analysis. In addition, Ferri (2012) encourages including withdrawn proposals in activism research, as excluding them potentially understates the success of activism efforts. However, in Table 2 we analyze voting patterns for the 64 proposals that went to vote to assess investor views for the different types of proposals and proponents.

------------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------------

For our target analysis, we lose 16 proposals because board gender data is not available from RiskMetrics for the year prior to the target. We also lose 26 proposals due to missing Compustat data or where a match could not be found. The resulting sample for our target analysis is 140 proposals. In Panel B of Table 1, we identify five activist groups among the 182 proposals submitted: public pension funds (14), institutional investors (60), individuals (14), religious organizations (90) and other (4). The public pension funds include Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds and California State Teacher’s Retirement; institutional investors include Calvert Asset Management and Citizen Funds; religious organizations include the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) and the Episcopal Church; and individuals include Thomas Gniewek, Jr. and Charles and Lois Edwards.

|Activist|Type|
|---|---|
|Public Pension Funds|14|
|Institutional Investors|60|
|Individuals|14|
|Religious Organizations|90|
|Other|4|

To consider how incentives might differ across activists, we categorize our proponents into two categories following Tkac (2006), and confirm this characterization by

our own examination of the stated objectives of different activist groups, where available. We define financially-motivated activists as those whose primary goal is to pursue financial returns, and include public pension funds and institutional investors in this category. Socially responsible mutual funds, such as Calvert, also fall in this category. While these funds screen investments according to ethical guidelines, their primary goal is still financial performance (Tkac 2006). In our (target analysis) sample, 78 (68) proposals are from financially-motivated proponents.

We categorize individuals and religious organizations as socially-motivated activists. Individuals are more likely to pursue shareholder activism that stems from personal preferences, while religious organizations tend to focus on issues of social and economic justice and utilize their investments and other resources “to change unjust or harmful corporate policies, working for peace, economic justice and stewardship of the Earth” (Tkac, 2006, p. 6). Louche, Arenas, & van Cranenburgh (2012) report that religious organizations are highly driven by the impact they can have on company behavior and society and therefore do not limit the purpose of investing to financial returns. In our (target analysis) sample, 104 (72) are from socially-motivated proponents.

While our classification is inherently subjective, we consider two alternative ways to validate our approach. First we consider whether share ownership varies across activist groups. Activists with significant share holdings are more likely to place primary emphasis on financial performance of the firm. In our sample, activists only occasionally disclose within the proposal how many shares they own, and we compute mean holdings where at least five activists of a given group provide the disclosure. The average number of shares held by public pension funds is 380,230; the average number of shares held by investment funds is 12,185; virtually no individuals or religious organizations in our sample disclosed their share holdings. However, Zhou (2013) finds that individual activists hold significantly fewer shares.

than institutions, including investments funds and public pension plans. These findings suggest that we can assume that at least the public pension funds and institutional investors have more at stake financially and are therefore more likely to be driven by financial concerns.

Second, we observe how the arguments made by activists in their proposals vary by activist type to provide evidence of construct validity (see below). Our characterization is supported if the arguments made by each activist type align with our characterization of those types, and if the arguments also differ statistically across activist types.

# Shareholder/Sentiment - Voting Patterns

In Table 2, we report voting patterns for the 64 proposals that went to vote by proposal type and proponent identity. The mean shareholder vote for the proposal is 17.4 percent, with votes for any given proposal ranging from 2.3 percent to 47.5 percent. It is notable that not one proposal in our sample received a majority vote. We also report voting patterns over three separate time periods: prior to Sarbanes-Oxley (Pre-SOX), 1997-2001; following SOX (Post-SOX), 2002-2008; and following Regulation S-K (Post-Disclose), 2009-2011. SOX required increased independence of boards, which potentially created new opportunities for women to serve on boards. In 2009, the SEC introduced Regulation S-K, which enhanced proxy statement disclosures, including those pertaining to board diversity. Specifically, the “comply-or-explain” provision 407(c)(2)(vi) of this rule requires firms to disclose whether and how nominating committees consider diversity in identifying nominees for directors. As reported in Table 2, we find that shareholder support appears to be increasing over time and highest following Regulation S-K, although we have few proposals that were voted on after Regulation S-K was introduced.

-------------------------------

Insert Table 2 about here

We observe two key types of proposals: proposals that call for the company to increase diversity, either by making an explicit commitment to do so, to make greater efforts to locate qualified candidates, or to adopt a formal process of inclusiveness; or, proposals that call for the company to report on diversity, either on its efforts to diversify the board, the criteria for selecting board candidates, or on the selection process. Shareholder support does not vary significantly across these two types of proposals. We also report voting across proponent identity, with the highest support for proposals presented by institutional investors and lowest for those from individual investors.

# Why Diversity Matters - Proponent Arguments

To better understand proponent motivations and to validate our classification scheme, we compare the arguments put forth by the two types of proponents – financially- versus socially-motivated. We obtain these arguments from the text of the proposals included in the firm’s proxy statement. Results are reported in Table 3. After reviewing all of the proposal texts, we identify seven primary themes: current status on diversity, decision-making, governance, talent pool, firm value, risk, and representativeness.

Almost all proposals, including 90.9 percent of financially-motivated and 92.9 percent of socially-motivated proposals, argue that increasing diversity leads to better decision-making by considering more perspectives, resulting in more nuanced and comprehensive solutions, or being less prone to “groupthink”. The next most common argument is that diversity increases firm value, through higher accounting and stock price performance, increased competitiveness, and by making the company more attractive to the investment community.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This argument is significantly more prevalent for financially-motivated proposals than for socially-motivated ones (90.9 percent versus 64.3 percent, p = 0.05), consistent with expectations. Also prevalent is the argument that diversity enhances the company’s talent pool and helps companies recruit, retain and promote the best people. Again, this argument is more prevalent for financial than social proposals (81.8 percent versus 50.0 percent, p = 0.05). In contrast, more social proposals argue that diversity is needed for greater representativeness, i.e. the board should reflect the shareholder base, customers, employees and the general population. A majority (61.9 percent) of social proposals include this argument, compared to 27.3 percent of financial proposals (p = 0.01). Arguments related to improved governance from increased diversity and to low existing levels of diversity are offered equally by both proponent types, and risk is only mentioned in three proposals.

The differences documented in Table 3 suggest that our classification of proposals as primarily either socially- or financially-motivated has reasonable construct validity, which is important in our formal hypothesis tests.

# RESULTS

# The Antecedents of Shareholder Activism

To examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to gender diversity, we compare firms targeted by a gender diversity proposal to a control sample of non-targeted S&P 1500 firms. As in Judge et al. (2010), we identify one-to-one matches for our sample of shareholder proposal firms based on industry, firm size, and fiscal year using the following procedure: (1) Within the same year and 2-digit SIC, we obtain matches that are within 10 percent of firm size (total assets); (2) If no match is found, we look within the same 1-digit SIC for a size match within 10 percent; (3) If no match is found, we look within the same 1-digit SIC for a size match with 50 percent. We are able to find matched controls for 140.

target firm-years. Total assets are not significantly different across the target and control groups, indicating that we have successfully matched on firm size.

To formally test our hypotheses, we estimate the following binary logistic regression:

Pr (Targeti,t) = α + αFemale Representationi,t-1 + αBoard Independencei,t-1 + βCONTROLt-1 + εi,t (1)

The dependent variable, Target, equals one if the firm receives a gender diversity-related shareholder proposal in year t, and zero otherwise. H1a and H2a predict that female board representation and board independence, respectively, are negatively associated with target likelihood. We measure female board representation (Female Representation) as the percentage of females on the board at year t-1. The independence of the board of directors (Board Independence) is measured as the percentage of board members who are classified as independent, defined as a person neither affiliated nor currently an employee of the company, at year t-1.

Following Judge et al. (2010) and Ertimur et al. (2011), we control for Firm Size, defined as the log of total assets, and Profitability, defined as return-on-assets or income before extraordinary items divided by total assets. Judge et al. (2010) note that prior profitability is higher for firms targeted with social proposals. Therefore, we expect a positive coefficient for both Firm Size and Profitability, although the coefficient for Firm Size is expected to be significantly lower than it would otherwise be if we had not already matched on size. We also control for board structure in equation (1) as this constitutes an internal governance mechanism that may affect shareholder activism (Judge et al. 2010). For example, Wu (2004) and Ertimur et al. (2011) find that smaller boards are more likely to be targeted by shareholder activists, while Carter et al. (2003) document a positive association between female board representation and board size. We therefore control for Board Size, measured as the number of board members, but make no prediction regarding its effect on the.

likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal relating to board gender diversity. Adding a female board member may be more feasible for larger boards, but attaining higher female representation is also more difficult for them. As indicated in equation (1), all independent variables are measured at year t-1.

Ertimur et al. (2011) also report a marginally positive association between shareholder activism and CEO duality; i.e., shareholders are more likely to target firms with CEOs who also serve as the board chairman. We therefore include a variable for duality to control for this effect. CEO Duality is defined as an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO also serves as the chair of the board, and zero otherwise. Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) find that when the CEO is a member of the nominating committee, the board tends to be less independent, which may attract activism. We thus include the indicator variable CEO on the Nominating Committee to control for this possible effect, where CEO on the Nominating Committee equals one if the CEO serves on the nominating committee, and zero otherwise.

Board characteristics are obtained from RiskMetrics, and financial data are obtained from Compustat. Both variables are measured at year t-1.

# 4. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for the variables of interest are reported in Table 4, Panel A. Female board representation is generally very low. The mean (median) Female Representation is only 2.9 percent (0.0 percent) for firm-years targeted with diversity proposals during 1997–2011, compared with 10.2 percent (11.1 percent) for the sample of matched control firms over the same period. This percentage is even lower for firms targeted by financially-motivated activists: here the mean (median) Female Representation is only 1.0 percent (0.0 percent). Targeted firms also have lower board independence, with mean (median) Board Independence of 61.1 percent (62.5 percent) compared with 70.4 percent (73.9 percent) for the matched controls. Targeted firms also tend to be more profitable (mean Profitability of 6.4 percent versus 3.4 percent), have smaller boards (mean of 8.89 versus...

9.79), and are less likely to have CEOs in dual chairman roles (0.64 versus 0.70) than the non-targeted controls. Regarding differences between firms targeted by financially- versus socially-motivated activists, the former tend to be smaller, more profitable, have smaller boards, are more likely to have CEO/COB duality, and are less likely to have their CEO on the nominating committee relative to the latter.

# 9. Panel B of Table 4

In Panel B of Table 4, we present Pearson correlation coefficients for the target analysis variables. The highest correlation coefficient is between Firm Size and Board Size ( = 0.59). In addition, both firm size and board size are highly correlated with female representation ( = 0.35 and = 0.34, respectively). To assess collinearity, we compute the condition numbers of the matrices of explanatory variables. According to Judge, Griffiths, Hill, Luetkepohl et al. (1985), condition numbers between 30 and 100 indicate moderate to strong dependencies. The highest condition number for our models is 21, indicating that collinearity is not a serious problem.

------------------------------- Insert Table 4 about here -------------------------------

# 10. Table 5

In Table 5, we present results from our logistic binary regression of target firm antecedents. To control for the influence of outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables Firm Size and Profitability at 1 percent and 99 percent. In Model 1, we estimate a baseline model using just the control variables and find that Firm Size and Profitability are significantly positively associated with shareholder activism, while Board Size and CEO Duality are negatively associated. In Model 2, the variables of interest are added. Consistent with H1a and H2a, we find that firms with high existing levels of female board representation and high levels of board independence are significantly less likely to be targeted by gender diversity proposals. The estimated α coefficients on Female Representation and Board Independence are -16.67 and -2.18, both significant at the 0.01 level. Notably, the R2

# Results

Increases dramatically when the two variables of interest are added, from 5.7 percent in the baseline model to 29.1 percent in Model 2.

# Model 3

In Model 3, we report results from a multinomial logit that allows for contrasts among three groups: financially-motivated, socially-motivated, and control firms. Our results are quite similar to those in Model 2. In Model 3A, where we compare firms targeted by socially-motivated activists with non-targeted firms, we find that targeted firms have significantly lower Female Representation and Board Independence than non-targeted firms. In Model 3B, where we compare firms targeted by financially-motivated activists with non-targeted firms, we find similar results. Of primary interest, however, is Model 3C where we compare firms targeted by socially-motivated activists with those targeted by financially-motivated ones. Here we find that none of the control variables is significant in distinguishing between activist type, but we do report significant differences for one of our main test variables. Firms targeted by financially-motivated activists have significantly lower Female Representation (α = -14.67, p = 0.01), consistent with H1b. This suggests that these proponents believe that they are likely to be most successful when targeting firms with few or no females on the board, that greater potential gains will accrue to these firms, or both. We do not find significant differences across the two groups for the variable Board Independence, and therefore H2b is not supported.

# Sensitivity Tests

In (untabulated) sensitivity tests, we repeat the analysis in Table 5 using a one-to-one random match to identify non-targeted control firms. The explanatory power is much higher in the random match model because of the higher significance of the variable Firm Size, which we use in Table 5 to identify matched controls but do not use in the random match model. Other notable differences are that Board Size is significantly negative in Models 2.

3A, and 3B and that CEO Duality is not significant in any of the specifications. Most importantly, the results are very similar for our main variables of interest, Female Representation and Board Independence, compared to those based on the size-industry match, i.e., they are significant in all specifications, and our inferences remain unchanged.

As an alternative specification, we also estimate Model 2 using a sample of all firm-years with the requisite data. Because we have only 143 target firm-years and 21,664 non-target firm-years in this analysis, we employ the penalized likelihood estimation, or Firth Method, as an approach for reducing small-sample bias in maximum likelihood estimation (King & Zeng, 2001). The results are very similar to those reported above in Table 5. The coefficients for Female Representation and Board Independence are negative and significant at the 0.0001 level.

Collectively, these results suggest that activists target firms with low female representation and lower board independence with gender diversity proposals. Further, we find that firms targeted by financially-motivated activists have even lower levels of female representation compared to those targeted by socially-motivated activists.

# The Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism

To assess whether shareholder proposals related to increasing gender diversity are effective, we examine female board representation from year -1 through year +2, where year 0 represents the year the sample firm was targeted. We define the variable Change in Female Representation as the change in the percentage of female members on the board from year -1 through year +2. We obtain data on female representation from RiskMetrics. For this analysis, we require sample firms/years to have all four years of data, resulting in a drop in sample size from 143 to 120. In order to attribute observed changes to shareholder activism,

we employ a one-to-one-matched pair design to control for other changes to board composition that might have occurred during our period of interest. We select control firms based on propensity score matching, which allows us to identify control firms that are most similar to our sample firms in terms of the likelihood of being targeted. The target model used to generate propensity scores is based on the most important variables in Table 5, namely Female Representation, Board Independence, Firm Size, Profitability, and Board Size. We also match by year and require the control firm to be in the same industry, defined by 2-digit SICs, as the sample firm.8

Univariate results are reported in Table 6. In Panel A we report the proportion of boards that have at least one female board member for both the 120 target and 120 non-target firms. In the year prior to being targeted, only 21.7 percent of target firms have at least one female board member; by year +2 this percentage increases to 57.5 percent. Therefore, 35.8 percent of target firms increased their female board representation from zero to at least one female board member from year -1 to year +2, an increase that is significant at the p = 0.01 level.

Control firms that had similar characteristics to targeted firms but were not targeted also show significant increases over the sample period, increasing from 35.8 percent to 52.5 percent. However, when comparing differences in differences, we find that the target firms’ increase of 35.8 percent is significantly higher than the control firms’ increase of 16.7 percent (p = 0.01).

------------------------------- Insert Table 6 about here -------------------------------

In Panels B and C, we report the proportions of boards that have at least one female board member separately for financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists, respectively. In Panel B we observe that only 6.5 percent of firms targeted by financially-motivated activists had any female board representation in year -1, while 27.4 percent of non-

Targeted firms had at least one female board member at this time, a highly significant difference at p = 0.01. While both targeted and non-targeted firms increase their female representation such that 50 percent of both samples have at least one female on their board of directors by year +2, a comparison of difference in differences shows that the increase in frequency is significantly greater for the targeted firms (p = 0.01). As shown in Panel C, 37.9 percent of firms targeted by socially-motivated activists have at least one female board member in year -1, versus 44.8 percent of non-targeted firms, a difference that is not statistically significant. The proportion of firms with any female board representation increases over the sample period for both groups; however, the increase for the targeted firms from 37.9 percent to 65.5 percent is significantly greater than the increase from 44.8 percent to 55.2 percent for the non-targeted firms (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that both financially- and socially-motivated activists are successful in achieving goals related to increasing gender diversity.

In Panels D through F, we report the mean percent of female board representation for targeted and non-targeted firms. Results are similar to those reported in Panels A through C. In Panel D we report changes for the full sample. As previously noted, both groups have markedly low female representation in year -1: 3.0 percent for sample firms and 4.4 percent for control firms. Again, both groups show significant improvements: target firms increase by 5.1 percent to 8.1 percent (p = 0.01) and non-target firms increase by 2.9 percent to 7.3 percent (p = 0.01), with the increase for target firms being significantly higher (p = 0.01). However, it is striking that female board representation remains relatively low at 8.1 percent for target firms in year +2.

We report changes in female representation for financially-motivated proposals in Panel E and for socially-motivated proposals in Panel F. Here the results confirm the earlier findings in Tables 4 and 5 – financially-motivated activists target firms with almost no female representation.

board representation and with significantly lower female board representation than non-target firms. Female board representation for target firms increases by 5.5 percent, from a mere 0.9 percent to 6.4 percent, compared to an increase of 3.5 percent for non-target firms. For socially-motivated firms, target and non-target firms are similar in year -1 (5.3 percent versus 5.7 percent), but once again target firms increase more significantly than non-target firms – by 4.7 percent to 10.0 percent compared to an increase of 2.3 percent to 8.0 percent for non-target firms. The differences in differences in Panels E and F are significant at the p = 0.10 and p = 0.05 levels, respectively.

These findings speak to the effectiveness of shareholder activism in this setting. While not one proposal that went to vote received a majority vote, many firms took action following the proposal, with almost 36 percent of firms increasing their female representation from zero to at least one for the period surrounding the proposal.

In addition to the univariate comparisons in Table 6, we perform a cross-sectional regression analysis of changes in female representation. Although we select the comparison group for the effectiveness analysis in Table 6 to include only those S&P 1500 firms that have the most similar propensity to be targeted as our sample firms, this additional cross-sectional analysis provides further assurance that other differences across the two groups are not driving our results. We define the dependent variable as the change in the percentage of female representation (Change in Female Representation) from year -1 to year +2 and regress is on the indicator variable Target and the set of independent variables used in the target antecedent analysis in Table 5.

Proposals are an effective means of increasing female board representation, after controlling for the effects of other potential determinants of increased representation.

The results are presented in Table 7. To control for outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables at 1 percent and 99 percent. We present five model specifications. In Model 1, we include all the control variables and report a significantly positive coefficient on Target (α = 0.02, p = 0.05), consistent with H3a. Only two control variables, Board Size (β = 0.01, p = 0.01) and existing levels of Female Representation (-0.34, p = 0.01), are significant determinants of increased representation. These findings are consistent in Model 2, where we drop Firm Size and Profitability control variables due to concerns about collinearity. (When we drop these variables, the highest condition index drops from 34 to 21.) These results confirm the findings in Table 6 that demonstrate the effectiveness of shareholder activism in increasing female representation.

We perform additional tests in Models 3 – 5. In Model 3, we add indicator variables for the time period following SOX (Post Sox), 2002-2008, when requirements for board independence increased; and following Regulation S-K (Post Disclose), 2009-2011, when enhanced proxy statement disclosures requirements, including those pertaining to board diversity, were introduced. In contrast to the descriptive evidence reported in Table 2 of increased shareholder support over time, we find no evidence of higher firm responsiveness over time. In particular, we do not see increased responsiveness leading up to or following the enhanced disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. In Model 4, we add an interaction term Target*Social Proponent to test whether activist type affects the effectiveness of the proposal in increasing female board representation, as prior research has shown that social activism tends to be less effective than financial activism (Goranova & Ryan, 2014). In this model, the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, and the coefficient on Target remains significantly positive. It thus appears that socially-motivated and financially-

motivated activists are equally effective in improving gender diversity, contrary to Hypothesis H3b.

In the foregoing analysis, we included shareholder proposals both that went to vote and those that did not, in accordance with Ferri (2012), who recommends consideration of both outcomes in activism research. He argues that excluding withdrawn proposals from the analyses potentially understates the success of activism efforts. In Model 5 we add an interaction term Target*Vote, to determine whether the proposal outcome (vote versus withdrawn) affects proposal effectiveness. Vote is defined as an indicator variable equal to one if the proposal went to vote, and zero otherwise. Here the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, and the coefficient on Target remains positive.

For these additional analyses in Model 3 to 5, we acknowledge that low statistical power may contribute to our lack of results due to the relatively small sample size. However, the consistent results for our main variable of interest, Target, gives us confidence that shareholder proposals are indeed an effective means of increasing gender diversity on corporate boards, despite the fact that none of the proposals in our sample received a majority vote.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Prior research on the antecedents and outcomes of shareholder activism has not specifically addressed the issue of board gender diversity, despite its growing importance internationally. Goranova and Ryan’s (2014) recent review of the shareholder activism literature reveals that while there are numerous prior studies that examine the antecedents of corporate governance shareholder proposals at a

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

At a broad level, there is not a single paper that focuses directly on gender diversity issues. Similarly, activist researchers have explored outcomes as varied as market reactions to shareholder proposals, firm operating performance, CEO turnover, managerial entrenchment, executive pay, and corporate social performance, yet no extant study, to our knowledge, has examined board gender diversity as an outcome of shareholder activism. We contribute to the activism literature by filling this void.

We find that the existing levels of female board representation and board independence are significant antecedents of activism and that female board representation is a stronger antecedent for financially-motivated activists than for socially-motivated activists. In addition, our evidence shows that shareholder proposals are effective in increasing board gender diversity – the female board representation of targeted firms increases significantly more in the two-year period following initiation of the proposal related to a sample of matched, non-targeted firms. This finding holds in univariate tests, as well as in a multivariate regression that controls for the level of female board representation prior to the target year and other potential determinants of female representation. We also find that both financially- and socially-motivated activism are equally effective in improving board gender diversity. These latter results contrast with findings in the prior literature that report that activism related to social issues such as gender diversity generally tend to be unsuccessful. They further challenge the seemingly accepted notion that financial activists tend to be more effective in achieving their goals than social activists.

While these findings extend the academic literature on shareholder activism, they also have potential implications for managers, activists, and policy-makers. For managers, the knowledge that low female board representation attracts activists and that both financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists are successful in improving gender diversity may lead them to improve board gender diversity without the impetus of a formal shareholder.

proposal. For activists, the knowledge that prior activists have been successful in improving gender diversity may inspire new initiatives, particularly for socially-motivated activists.

However, we note that while our results indicate that shareholder activism is an effective means of improving corporate board gender diversity, mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the 20 percent or 30 percent thresholds that are sought by various activist groups, even in the post-proposal period. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these more ambitious goals. To best inform policy-makers, more research is needed to understand the consequences of alternative regulatory responses, from mandated quotas to “softer” initiatives including “comply-or-explain” disclosure requirements that have been introduced in recent years (Adams et al., 2015).

Future research can also help us better understand the antecedents and consequences of female board representation. Hillman (2015) asks whether the different outcomes of increased female board representation depend on how the increase was achieved. For example, does the role that women play on the board, such as committee membership or board tenure differ depending on whether the female appointment is voluntary, through the introduction of a legal quota, or as a result of activism? Does the method of appointment affect other outcomes, such as subsequent firm performance and board monitoring? That is, is the method of appointment a moderating variable between female representation and outcomes? Also, does female board representation increase female representation at other levels within the firm (Ferreira, 2015) and does this depend on how the increase is achieved?

Further, is shareholder activism an effective mechanism for addressing broader gender inequities such as equal employment opportunity reporting for all levels within a firm? Future work is needed to address these important questions.

# Future Work and Limitations

Several areas for future work also arise from the inherent limitations of our study. We have relied on two theoretical perspectives in framing our analysis – that of agency theory and institutional theory – but acknowledge that other theoretical perspectives might also afford insight into gender diversity questions. For example, resource dependency theory or social network theory might also provide equally useful perspectives in this line of inquiry. Future research might consider related questions from these alternative vantage points.

A second limitation is that we dichotomize our sample of shareholder proposals into two groups based on the motivation of the activist (i.e., either financially- or socially-motivated). However, motivations cannot be observed directly, and we must infer motivation from stated objectives of activist groups. While we conduct two tests to gain confidence that our classification scheme has reasonable construct validity, there may be some measurement error in determining activist motivation. Alternative research methods for exploring the motivations of activists, including field-based studies, could be useful here.

Also, our findings likely understate the effectiveness of shareholder activism in this setting. The proposals we examine call for both gender and racial diversity, but restrictions in the RiskMetrics database preclude us from evaluating outcomes regarding race over our period of interest. Therefore, we are unable to tabulate improvements to board diversity related to racial diversity. Future research might address the question of racial diversity and shareholder activism.

As a last point, while we focus on shareholder activism, Aguilera et al. (2015) propose that internal mechanisms, like board structure and ownership structure, and external mechanisms, like shareholder activism or media, can work together to improve governance effectiveness. An example would be the confluence of an active board, activist shareholders, and high levels of media scrutiny working together to influence strategic decisions and firm.

outcomes. Therefore, future research could identify different configurations of internal and external mechanisms to better understand the drivers of effective corporate governance.

4. ISS Environmental and Social Governance 2014 Proxy Season Review. The Thirty Percent Coalition is an organization of institutional investors, members of the business community, and women’s organizations whose goal is to reach 30 percent female representation on public company boards by the end of 2015. Female board representation for S&P 1500 firms was 14 percent in 2013, compared to 7 percent in 1997 (RiskMetrics).
5. Cziraki, Renneboog, & Szilagyi (2010) report that the frequency of proposals is just over 4 percent of publicly-listed companies in the U.S. over 1996-2005 but only around 1 percent in the UK and Continental Europe. Similarly, Judge et al. (2010) find that in a sample of over 9,000 shareholder activism incidents in over 10 countries, 52 percent occur in the U.S.
6. While the focus of our paper is on gender diversity, the shareholder proposals in our sample typically call for increased representation from “women” and “minorities” / “persons of color”. Because we are not able to identify board members from minority groups through RiskMetrics of the majority of our time frame, we are not able to compare our sample to S&P 1500 firms on this dimension.
7. We do not include time period controls in Table 5 since we match on year, in effect controlling for time effects in Models 1 and 2. However, in sensitivity tests, we add indicator variables for the time period following SOX (Post Sox), 2002-2008, when requirements for board independence increased; and following Regulation S-K (Post Disclose), 2009-2011, when enhanced proxy statement disclosures requirements, including those pertaining to board diversity, were introduced. Post Sox and Post Disclose are not significant in Models 1 or 2, as expected. However, we find both variables to be positive and significant in Models 3B and 3C, suggesting that financial activists are more likely to target firms in later years. Further, when we control for these time periods, Board Independence approaches significance in Model 3C (p = 0.12 in two-tailed tests) providing weak support for Hypothesis 2b.
8. Mean values (p-values for difference) for target and non-target firms for the independent variables are: Female Representation of 3.0 percent versus 4.4 percent (p = 0.01); Board Independence of 61.1 percent versus 61.8 percent (p = 0.70); SIZE of

8.186 versus 7.923 (p = 0.12); Profitability of 0.070 versus 0.078 (p = 0.31); and Board Size of 8.783 versus 8.858 (p = 0.81). Therefore, target firms are equivalent on all dimensions except female representation. Although we always select a match with the closest propensity score in absolute value terms, our target firms have significantly higher scores than our control firms (p = 0.01) and are higher in 2/3 of the 120 cases. We attribute this to the fact that our sample firms often have the highest propensity to be targeted among all the firms in industry. These statistics underscore our finding in Table 5 that activists target firms with unusually low female board representation. Also, while non-target firms have significantly lower female representation than S&P 1500 firms on average, they are still not as low as our sample firms. We conduct additional tests in Table 7 to control for Female Representation.

# Can Socially Responsible Investments Be Compatible with Financial Performance?

# Abstract

This paper examines whether socially responsible investment (SRI) outperforms conventional investments by meta-analysis. The result shows that weighted average effect size is not significantly different from zero, suggesting that SRI performance is not different from conventional investments. Meta-regression results regarding sampling issues indicate that economic crisis, control group, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds are important determinants of effect sizes, and publication year, author type, and control group are important factors of the absolute value of effect sizes. Regarding methodological issues, risk adjustment, weighting scheme, data refinement, benchmark model, and matching procedure are significant factors determining the absolute value of effect sizes.

# 1. Introduction

Researchers and investors have long been curious about whether socially responsible investment (SRI) funds and portfolios financially outperform conventional ones. Early studies date back to the 1970s (Moskowitz, 1972; Alexander and ...

Buchholz, 1978), and a significant amount of research has been accumulated so far.1 However, existing evidence shows mixed results. For example, Auer (2016) shows that investors can do financially well while doing social good based on environmental, social, and governance ratings data for the European market. However, Renneboog et al. (2008a) report that the SRI funds of France, Ireland, Sweden, and Japan significantly underperform conventional funds by 4–7% per annum during the period 1991–2003. In addition, there are many other papers that report no difference in performance between SRI and conventional funds (Hamilton et al., 1993; Kreander et al., 2005; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Hoepner and Schopohl, 2018).

It is imperative to determine the overall influence of SRI on investment performance, because if the impact is positive, investors will voluntarily participate in socially beneficial investments and government does not have to intervene in the market to promote social goals. If the impact is negative, however, investors have to sacrifice their investment benefits to pursue their social preferences and the public sector has to intervene in one way or another to encourage SRI activities. The direction and magnitude of SRI influence can also have a profound implication for financial industries with respect to product development, asset management, fiduciary duty, performance evaluation, and so forth. Understanding the impact of SRI is also important to academic research. As Combs et al. (2011) point out, without a proper synthesis of existing literature more fruitful further research is difficult.

Despite this, there have been few attempts to synthesize existing literature on SRI and even these have not been successful. For example, Rathner (2013) lacks representativeness due to a small sample size and incomplete methodology. Revelli and Viviani (2015) performed a meta-analysis based on 85 studies. However, they fail to draw a sharp conclusion due to ambiguity caused by pooling several countries in one sample. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) show that culture is an important determinant of SRI influence, so combining countries with different cultural backgrounds will prevent researchers from obtaining a correct picture of SRI.2 More importantly, they analyze the impact of moderators only on effect size (hereafter, ES) ignoring the impact on the absolute value of effect size (hereafter, AES).

1 SRI is different from corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR focuses on corporate social activities and papers on CSR examine whether firms can improve financial performance by engaging in socially desirable activities. SRI focuses on investment strategies that employ various screening procedures (e.g., positive, negative, and best-in-the-class) based on so-called ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria and papers on SRI compare the investment performance of these portfolio strategies with conventional ones.

2 Moreover, their study seems to have multiple errors. For example, they include Smith (1996), which is an event study, even though they explicitly mention that they do not include event studies in the text. Gregory et al. (1997) have a Hedges’ g value of 0.24 in their Appendix, but the sign should be negative since the ethical funds performed worse than the non-ethical funds.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Although many valuable conjectures can be made regarding AES. This point is especially important in the current situation where positive and negative effects coexist, since focusing only on the level of ESs will average out positive and negative impacts leading researchers to underestimate the impact of SRI. To our knowledge, our paper is the first that investigates the influence of moderators on both ESs and AESs.

Another reason for the lack of sound summary papers is the diversity and complexity of existing studies with regard to samples, methodologies, performance measures, investment universe, benchmarks, etc. A meta-analysis is a very useful scientific tool to synthesize a wide variety of heterogeneous papers. It calculates ES that can be interpreted as a standardized difference between performances of SRI and conventional portfolios. By standardizing performance differences, whatever the performance measures, a common measure of difference between the two types of portfolios is generated, making synthesis possible across very diverse papers.

Given the situation in SRI research, this article attempts to achieve the following goals. First, we provide a sound synthesis of existing literature which shows an overall influence of SRI on investment performance in terms of sign and magnitude through a meta-analysis. Then, we examine a variety of determinants of SRI influence, since it is conceivable that the magnitude and direction of SRI effects may have a systematic relationship with sample characteristics and research methodologies. The analyses on moderators will help us to produce interesting implications for future research and practice. When performing the analysis, we carefully explain our meta-analysis and data collection process to ensure replicability.

This study is organized as follows. In the next section, we develop hypotheses regarding the overall impact of SRI and moderators that can have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. In Section 3, we explain the meta-analysis and the concept of ES and show definitions of moderators used for hypothesis testing. In Section 4, we present our sampling process in detail, since sampling is crucial in performing and interpreting a meta-analysis. Section 5 reports the meta-analysis results, and Section 6 presents conclusions and discussions.

# 2. Hypotheses

Our initial research interest is on the average impact of SRI on investment performance. Thus, we first propose a hypothesis on the overall ES and then proceed to establish hypotheses for moderators that may have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. We attempt to employ moderators to reflect research characteristics as extensively as possible based on theory and practice. We split the moderators into two broad categories: sampling and methodology. Sampling relates to data collection, and methodology is about analysis tools.

# 2.1. Overall Effect Size

The CSR literature shows that CSR firms perform better than non-CSR firms (Wu, 2006; Margolis et al., 2009). Since SRI invests more in CSR firms, the performance of SRI will be higher than conventional investments. SRI performance can also be better since SRI fund managers may have a deeper knowledge of their investment pools (Girard et al., 2007; Gil-Bazo et al., 2010). SRI screening eliminates unethical firms from the investment universe, and fund managers can focus on a relatively small number of firms. In fact, Kacperczyk et al. (2005) show that more concentrated portfolios produce a higher return than broadly diversified portfolios. SRI fund turnover is lower since SRI investors are more loyal to social values than conventional investors, and the resulting lower transaction costs also predict a better performance.

On the other hand, portfolio theory predicts an inferior performance of SRI portfolios. Other things being equal, SRI constraints on the investment universe will lead to a less favorable efficient frontier, sacrificing diversification benefits (Girard et al., 2007; Renneboog et al., 2008a). For example, excluding sin stocks can cause investors to sacrifice returns, since they generate a higher risk-adjusted return than conventional stocks (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Durand et al., 2013; Borgers et al., 2015). The higher transaction costs and management fees of SRI funds also predict an inferior performance, since they are relatively small, losing economies of scale (Bauer et al., 2005; Barnett and Salomon, 2006). Ayadi et al. (2011) find that the average expense ratio of Canadian SRI fund is 1.97%, which is much larger than the 1.29% global benchmark for conventional funds.

Finally, any impact of SRI cannot be justified theoretically. The efficient market hypothesis predicts that SRI portfolios and funds cannot produce abnormal returns, since investors and fund managers can easily replicate ethical screening procedures which are public information. Even though some SRI funds seem to outperform conventional funds, their performance superiority may vanish if transaction costs are subtracted.

On the empirical side, evidence is also mixed with positive (Hickman and Teets, 1999; Guenster et al., 2005; Brander, 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2007; Galema et al., 2008; Peiris and Evans, 2010) and negative (Mueller, 1991; Girard et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2013) impacts for SRI. In addition, there are many papers reporting no impact. For example, Kreander et al. (2005) uncover similar performances between SRI and conventional funds when they investigate the SRI funds of seven European countries. Bauer et al. (2007) examine a sample of Canadian ethical funds and again find no significant difference between SRI and conventional funds. In addition, there are still many papers that report no difference between SRI and conventional investments (Sauer, 1997; Hutton et al., 1998; Benson et al., 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Renneboog et al., 2008a; Humphrey et al., 2016). Therefore, we establish a null hypothesis on the overall effect of SRI as follows.

# Hypothesis 1.

The influence of SRI will not be different from zero.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

# 2.2. Sampling Issues

# 2.2.1. Time

Among various sampling issues that generate the SRI performance documented in many studies, the first-order effect could be caused by the change in the conceptualization of social responsibility. Over the past three decades, not only firms but also investors have changed their views on CSR. In earlier years, the CSR strategy may have been adopted by innovative firms and the SRI strategy, including these firms, may have outperformed conventional investment strategies. However, the relative advantage of SRI may have weakened over time since the uniqueness of SRI has decreased as more firms promote CSR activities. This process will lead to a lower abnormal return over time. It is also possible that investing communities will learn from academic studies. As more investors use SRI investment strategy via the learning process, the return can diminish. Consistent with this argument, Hoepner and Schopohl (2018) show that estimates for the impact of SRI become marginally significant or lose their significance over the sub-period 2008–2015 when compared with the entire sample period 2001–2015.

However, the dampening impact SRI process may not be a uniformly decreasing one, but rather alternate in sign. Research in general tends to show three dialectical stages of development (O’Connor, 2003). A thesis is posited in the beginning and it gives rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis. Finally, a synthesis resolves the tension between the two. We can expect that research in the SRI area may also follow a similar pattern. Since the merits of SRI were overemphasized in the beginning, an argument of negative impact shows up as an antithesis which is followed by a synthesis that supports no or less impact. As for the degree of fluctuation, it will decrease over time. Since methodologies have become more sophisticated over time, any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios caused by misspecification of methodologies will become smaller over time. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2-1. ESs are positive in the beginning and change signs with decreasing absolute value.

During times of economic crisis, portfolio performance reduces compared to normal periods. The SRI performance will follow a similar pattern and the ESs computed from the sample period including a crisis will be different from those in normal periods. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2-2. Papers whose sample periods include a crisis period will show smaller ESs than papers whose sample periods do not include a crisis.

# 2.2.2. Publication

One of the important considerations in meta-analysis regarding sampling is publication bias. As the phrase “Publish or Perish” signifies, publication is imperative in academia (Zivney and Bertin, 1992). Since so many papers are submitted, academic

Journals have become very selective and papers with a high statistical significance are more likely to be published than papers with insignificant results (Song et al., 2000). According to Stanley (2005), we can suspect that type II selection error, that is, a tendency to report significant results excessively, exists if the values of standardized ESs exceed 1.96 more than 5% of the time. Other things being equal, if a publication bias exists, published papers will have higher ESs, either positive or negative. In order to check whether our sample has publication bias, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 3.

The AESs for published papers will be higher than those for unpublished papers.

# 2.2.3. Author type.

Papers written by professional managers and scholars can show differences in ESs since they are quite different in various respects, including incentives for performing research. For example, Vaihekoski (2004) mentions that academic researchers are, in general, concerned with aspects related to asset pricing, whereas institutional investors are primarily interested in detecting opportunities that can generate superior risk-adjusted performance. Asset pricing is closely related to the efficient market hypothesis, and insignificant differences between SRI performances and conventional portfolios can be accepted as confirming market efficiency. However, if a large difference is found between the two performances, justification regarding the causes of the difference is often quite challenging. Among industry professionals, however, market efficiency is not accepted as a norm, so researchers from financial industries may pay more attention to finding profit potential than supporting market efficiency. Therefore, we conjecture that researchers in academia tend to find a smaller performance difference between SRI and conventional groups than industry professionals. In order to test this argument, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 4-1.

The AESs obtained by academic researchers will be smaller than those obtained by industry researchers.

It is possible that researchers in different disciplines may have different perspectives on SRI and this will lead to a systematic difference in their research outcomes. For example, researchers in the finance area may focus more on profit maximization and argue against the benefit of SRI, while researchers in other areas such as business ethics may think social benefits are more important than monetary benefits, advocating for SRI. To examine the impact of a difference in researcher perspectives on ESs, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 4-2.

The ESs of papers published in finance journals will be smaller than those published in non-finance journals.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

# 2.2.4. Control group.

Researchers compare the performance of SRI funds and portfolios with the performance of various control groups. For example, Muñoz et al. (2015) compare SRI mutual funds with conventional mutual funds, while Edmans (2011) compares SRI portfolios with market indexes. In general, the difference between SRI portfolios and market indexes is higher than that between SRI portfolios and corresponding conventional portfolios. Whereas SRI portfolios suffer from diversification loss due to screening procedures, market indexes do not. On the other hand, conventional portfolios are formed by an author(s) considering comparability with SRI portfolios. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 5-1.

The comparison between SRI portfolios and market indexes will have larger AESs than the comparison between SRI and conventional portfolios.

For the papers that use conventional market indexes as the control group, the treatment groups are either SRI portfolios or SRI indexes (Statman, 2006). In this case, the discrepancy between the two indexes, i.e., SRI and conventional, is smaller than that between SRI portfolios and conventional indexes. For example, the Domini Social Index is a leading market capitalization-weighted SRI index. It was created in 1990 by starting with the companies in the S&P 500 index, so many companies are included in both indexes (Di Bartolomeo and Kurtz, 1999; Brander, 2006). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 5-2.

The AESs will be smaller when SRI indexes rather than SRI portfolios are compared with conventional indexes.

Socially responsible investment portfolios have a less favorable risk–return trade-off due to diversification loss (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Statman and Glushkov, 2009). When market portfolios are used rather than conventional portfolios composed by researchers as a control group, the degree of diversification loss is relatively larger. This leads to the following hypothesis regarding ESs themselves.

# Hypothesis 5-3.

Experiments using market index as a control group will have smaller ESs than those using conventional portfolios as a control group.

# 2.2.5. Investment universe.

Cultural elements are important in studying the impact of SRI (Hill et al., 2007; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). Since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006), SRI funds can appeal more strongly to regions with a similar cultural background than to other countries with different cultural backgrounds. Indeed, Jones et al. (2008) find that SRI funds with a high exposure to international capital markets underperform the market by 3% per annum. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

© 2019 Korean Securities Association

# C.-S. Kim

# Hypothesis 6.

The performance of domestic SRI funds will be better than international SRI funds.

# 2.2.6. Screening procedure.

Funds using negative screening exclude unethical firms, and sometimes even entire industries, from their portfolios, causing a sharp shrink in the portfolio frontier. Moreover, since sin stocks seem to perform better, SRI based on negative screening will result in a worse performance than conventional investment (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). This problem is less severe in the case of positive screening, since fund managers can add SR stocks to their existing portfolios. Even when SRI managers select stocks purely based on positive criteria, they may perform better than broadly diversifying fund managers since they may have an intimate knowledge of SR stocks (Kacperczyk et al., 2005; Girard et al., 2007). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 7.

Funds employing a positive screening procedure will outperform those with a negative screening procedure.

# 2.2.7. Mutual funds.

In existing literature, many authors study the performance of SRI mutual funds (Geczy et al., 2005; Chang and Witte, 2010; Climent and Soriano, 2011; Muñoz et al., 2014), while others study SRI portfolios formed by themselves (Diltz, 1995; Gompers et al., 2003; Core et al., 2006). There can be differences between the two types of research since it is well known that managed funds rarely beat the market (Jensen, 1968; Ferson and Schadt, 1996; Ferson and Warther, 1996; Carhart, 1997). In addition, funds formed by researchers do not consider market frictions such as liquidity constraints and transaction costs explicitly, which is not the case in the analysis of mutual funds (Adamsson and Hoepner, 2015). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 8.

ESs from examining SRI mutual funds will be lower than ESs from examining portfolios formed by researchers.

# 2.3. Methodological Issues

Effect sizes can also vary with methodologies employed. In particular, under efficient capital markets, there should not be a performance difference between SRI and conventional portfolios if all relevant factors are considered. However, if some important determinants are omitted by methodological misspecification, it will.

Although methodological issues exist for most asset pricing/capital market studies, they are particularly important in the meta-analysis of SRI. The result on SRI performance can be systematically different depending on the research methodologies used. Thus, investigating the impact of methodological difference on ESs from a variety of different angles can significantly enhance our understanding of SRI.

produce a spurious difference in portfolio performances. For instance, Gregory et al. (1997) reveal that the outperformance of UK SRI funds found in previous studies disappears when they improve methodology by using a two-factor benchmark to control size. In general, the more rigorous the methodologies, the smaller the possible confounding effects.

Existing literature examines various methods of controlling for these problems, and this paper categorizes these into three groups, that is, variable adjustment (e.g. risk adjustment, value-weighting, splits and dividends adjustment), refining benchmark model (e.g. multi-factor model, conditional model), and matching.

# 2.3.1. Variable adjustment.

Performance proxies in the existing literature can broadly be categorized as measures with and without risk adjustment. Raw returns are the performance measure without considering risk, while Jensen’s alpha, the Sharpe ratio, and the Treynor ratio are risk-adjusted measures. If raw returns are used even though the portfolios of SR and conventional firms have different risk profiles, there can be a spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional investment because they do not reflect proper risk factors (Becchetti and Ciciretti, 2009). Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-1.

The AESs will be smaller when risk-adjusted performance measures are used.

When calculating portfolio returns, value-weighting is theoretically more appropriate than equal-weighting. Value-weighting schemes are also in accord with typical financial industry practice (Humphrey and Tan, 2014), and most feasible for institutional investors who constitute the largest proportion of the SRI market (Trinks and Scholtens, 2017). In some cases, results based on value-weighting are different from those based on equal-weighting. For example, Statman and Glushkov (2009) find that excess returns of value-weighted portfolios are lower than those of equally weighted portfolios. If SRI mutual funds have a higher exposure to small firms than conventional funds (Luther and Matatko, 1994; Schröder, 2003), equal-weighting schemes can generate undeserved performance differences between SRI and conventional portfolios. In order to examine this effect, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-2.

The AESs calculated using a value-weighting scheme will be smaller than those using an equal-weighting scheme.

When calculating returns, some papers pay more attention to data accuracy by taking dividends and stock splits into account (Shank et al., 2005), whereas other papers ignore them. Inaccurate data can cause a spurious difference between SRI and conventional portfolios. For example, if SRI funds in general invest more in small firms than conventional funds (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994), ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in the performance.

of SRI and conventional portfolios. This is because, other things being equal, the SRI universe would have a lower dividend payout ratio than the conventional funds universe due to the higher investment opportunities of small firms over large firms. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-3.

The ESs will be smaller when returns are calculated reflecting stock splits and dividends.

# 2.3.2. Refining benchmark model.

Several authors examine the impact of SRI in the US market using a single-index framework (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005). However, the single-index model can produce distorted results by not controlling factors other than market portfolio. Prior literature indicates that SRI and conventional funds are different in their investment universe and portfolio strategies, having significantly different loadings on size, book-to-market, and momentum factors (Bauer et al., 2005; Renneboog et al., 2008b). In order to take into account the difference between the two types of funds, researchers use multi-factor models (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997; Galema et al., 2008; Edmans, 2011). A spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds may disappear if all relevant factors are incorporated.

CAPM, the Fama-French model, and the four-factor Carhart model are unconditional models since coefficients of factors do not change over time. In practice, however, fund managers change their portfolio holdings according to changes in macroeconomic environments, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles (Renneboog et al., 2008a). In this situation, the unconditional model may be inappropriate, hence Ferson and Schadt (1996) and Christopherson et al. (1998) propose conditional models that allow coefficients of factors to vary over time. Since investors on SRI funds may not be as sensitive as investors on conventional funds to economic environment changes, SRI funds may not adjust their portfolio holdings as quickly as conventional funds (Bollen, 2007; Benson and Humphrey, 2008). If this behavioral difference is ignored in deriving performance measures by employing the unconditional model as a benchmark, SRI performance would become spuriously different from conventional performance. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 10.

The AESs calculated using more refined return-generating models will be smaller.

# 2.3.3. Matching.

Some authors employ a matching procedure where each SRI fund is mapped with conventional funds of similar characteristics like size, location, composition, and time horizon so as to control confounding factors (Derwall and Koedijk, 2009; Ferruz et al., 2012; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). If proper counterfactuals to SRI portfolios are employed, the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance can be eliminated. Therefore, the AESs will be smaller when matching procedure is employed.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

The above discussion on methodological issues leads to the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 11.

The AESs will be smaller when more sophisticated methodologies are employed.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Meta-analysis

Since positive, negative, and no effect views can all be justified theoretically, synthesizing empirical findings to obtain the true overall impact of SRI is very important to both academia and industry. A meta-analysis is a particularly useful tool for this purpose, since it reflects the magnitude of performance differences between SRI and conventional groups by calculating ESs of individual studies and reporting overall ES utilizing information on the precision of individual studies (Combs et al., 2011).

Specifically, the first step of meta-analysis is to calculate the ES for each experiment or paper using Hedges’ g as follows (Hedges, 1981):

g = PT / r  (1)

where PT (PC) is the mean performance of portfolios included in the SRI (conventional) group and r is the pooled within-group standard deviation which can be computed using the following formula:

r = √((NT - 1)VT + (NC - 1)VC) / (NT + NC - 2)  (2)

where NT (NC) is the sample size of the SRI (conventional) group and VT (VC) is the variance of the SRI (conventional) group. Intuitively, the ES can be interpreted as a standardized performance difference between the two groups whatever the performance measures are and Table 1 shows the interpretation of ESs. The value of d = 0.01 has a very small effect, while d = 2.0 has a huge effect. Although we can typically compute ESs using the above equations, there are other cases where ESs are computed using different equations. The Appendix provides a detailed explanation on how to achieve ESs in special cases.

Once we obtain the ESs of each experiment or paper, the next step is to compute the weighted ES by considering all papers in the sample so as to obtain the overall SRI impact on portfolio performance as proposed by Hasselblad and Hedges.

There are in general multiple analyses in one paper. We use the terms “analysis,” “study,” “experiment” and “comparison” interchangeably.

# Table 1 Interpretation of effect size

This table contains interpretations for magnitudes of effect size and their references. Originally Cohen (1988) suggested three groups of ESs, small, medium, and large, and the other three ESs have been appended by Sawilowsky (2009). A similar interpretation can be made in cases of negative effect sizes.

|Effect size|d|References|
|---|---|---|
|Very small|0.01|Sawilowsky (2009)|
|Small|0.20|Cohen (1988)|
|Medium|0.50|Cohen (1988)|
|Large|0.80|Cohen (1988)|
|Very large|1.20|Sawilowsky (2009)|
|Huge|2.00|Sawilowsky (2009)|

(1995). The basic idea of weighting is to give higher weights to studies with more precise ES estimates, and the reciprocal of variance for each comparison is used as weights. When aggregating ESs, we use either a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model, depending on the assumption for variability. Details are in the Appendix. In addition, we delve into the possibility that SRI impacts on financial performance may vary systematically according to moderators and thus perform meta-regression analysis (Lipsey, 2001).

# 3.2. Variable Definitions

Table 2 summarizes all moderators and variables including dependent variables, either ESs or AESs. We split moderators into two broad categories, one for sampling and the other for methodology.

# 3.2.1. Sampling.

In order to investigate sampling issues, we establish moderators for time, publication status, researcher background, control groups, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds. Each moderator can have more than one variable to test a hypothesis, and variable definitions are shown in Table 2. For example, three variables are used to test publication status. Since publication bias is about statistical significance, we use two variables, Publication and Significance. In addition, we use a Quality variable to examine whether there is a systematic difference in AES according to journal quality. To examine the influence of control groups on ESs and AESs, we use two variables. SRP_CI is used to test Hypotheses 5-1 and 5-3 and SRI_CI is used to test Hypothesis 5-2.

# 3.2.2. Methodology.

As for methodology, we investigate issues related to variable adjustment (risk adjustment, portfolio weighting scheme, data accuracy), adding independent variables (multi-factor model, conditional model) and a matching procedure. To see the impact of the matching procedure, we also use two variables, Matching and Match_N. If

multiple firms are matched to an SRI sample, potential errors caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in the case of a one-to-one match can be minimized. This will in turn reduce the spurious difference between SRI and control portfolios.

# 4. Data

Since representativeness is crucial in meta-analysis, we try to collect as many papers as possible including unpublished ones to avoid publication bias. We search databases such as EBSCO, JSTOR, Science Direct, Springer Link, Wiley-Blackwell, and SSRN, and utilize web search engines like Google Scholar. We also attempt to collect papers from many academic journals, as shown in Table A2 of the Appendix.

A detailed description of our data collection process is shown in Table A1 and a flowchart in the Appendix. We first compose keywords that are related to SRI as extensively as possible. By using the phrase “socially responsible investment,” we obtain 1,555 articles that include at least one word in the phrase. Then, we check all articles one by one to sort out those that have the potential to be included in our final list of papers. By using the next phrase, “socially responsible investing,” we have 1,226 results. Since the two phrases are quite similar, most observations are duplicates of the first search and we obtain only two additional articles that have the potential to be included in the final sample. The process continues with new phrases until we use “ethical investing,” as shown in Table A1 of the Appendix. Since too many duplicates appear by that time, we begin to use the exact phrase “social investing” to narrow down the search results. We download 151 papers from this keyword search. Another important data collection process is to scrutinize the reference section of selected papers, especially summary or synthesis papers (Renneboog et al., 2008b; Chegut et al., 2011; Capelle-Blancard and Monjon, 2014).

After potential papers are collected, we read them more carefully to decide which papers are to be included in the final sample. Since the quality of data is crucial for an accurate assessment of SRI effects, we pay very careful attention to the data compilation process. The following explains some of the steps we have taken to preserve data integrity. Further details are in the Appendix.

1. We drop qualitative analyses.
2. If there are several versions of the same paper, we use the most recent paper to avoid overrepresentation bias. For example, Derwall et al. (2004) is a working paper version of Derwall et al. (2005), and we use the latter.
3. We include studies with matching firms or studies without matching firms but with market indices as benchmarks of SRI performance.
4. We include all relevant analyses based on important dimensions such as investment universe, sub-periods, conditional versus unconditional regression, matching versus non-matching, value weighted versus equal weighted, risk-adjusted versus risk-unadjusted, one-factor model versus multi-factor model, etc.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

After this screening process, we obtain 51 papers, 18 from the keyword search and 33 from reference checking, which study the impact of SRI on financial performance in the US. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) assert that the influence of SRI varies significantly with a difference in cultural background. Focusing on the US market helps us sharpen the interpretation of results without the need to consider cultural differences. Figure S1 shows the flowchart of the selection process. The publication dates of the final sample run from 1978 to 2016.

From the selected papers, we extract 205 experiments to calculate ESs. In other words, our number of observations is the number of experiments, not papers, since each paper reports multiple analyses. For example, if a paper reports two tables of comparison between SRI and conventional funds, with one based on raw return and the other based on Jensen’s alpha, we end up having two observations. Since a paper often reports results based on various subsamples, different experiments of the same paper can have different values for the number of firms, sample period, and all other relevant variables. We report detailed information including ESs on all 205 experiments in Table A2 of the Appendix.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Results on Effect Sizes

Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of ESs calculated from 205 comparisons. The median and mean ESs are 0.015 and 0.016 that can be interpreted as having very small ES according to Table 1. This result is consistent with many existing papers (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Humphrey et al., 2016). They find no significant difference in the performance of SRI and conventional funds in the US market, even though they examine different samples and time periods. The distribution of ESs is not normal since skewness and kurtosis are significantly different from normal distribution.

The first result of interest in our meta-analysis is the overall value of ESs that allows us to judge the impact of SRI on investment performance. In order to calculate the weighted ES, we use the reciprocal of variance of each comparison. Table 4 shows weighted ESs from running fixed and random-effect models. The weighted ES from the fixed-effect model is 0.068 and is statistically very significant. Although this result clearly indicates that the influence of SRI is negative to portfolio performance, it can be interpreted as having a very small effect economically.

This table shows weighted ESs and its 95% confidence interval from fixed- and random-effect models. It also reports test statistics for the appropriateness of using the random-effect model, Cochran’s Q or I2 statistic. *** represents statistical significance levels at the 1% levels, respectively.

Heterogeneity chi-squared = 4058.62*** (d.f. = 204) p = 0.000

I2 (variation in ES attributable to heterogeneity) = 95.0%

Test of ES = 0 : z = 18.16 p = 0.000

Test of ES = 0 : z = 0.51 p = 0.607

According to Table 1. Besides, the test statistic to judge between the fixed- and random-effect models, Cochran’s Q, strongly suggests that the random-effect model should be used in order to control heterogeneity among different studies. The value of I2 indicates that 95% of total variance is caused by between-study heterogeneity.

For the random-effect model, the variance used to calculate weight is the sum of within-study variance and between-study variance. In Table 4, the between-study variance is reported as s2, 0.0764, which is quite large. Unlike the result of the fixed-effect model, the weighted ES from the random-effect model is positive in sign, but the size is negligible and lacks statistical significance. This result largely supports Hypothesis 1 and is consistent with the evidence in many empirical papers on SRI (Sauer, 1997; Bello, 2005; Kreander et al., 2005; Bauer et al., 2007; Gregory and Whittaker, 2007).

Although the overall ES is not significantly different from zero, ESs can be systematically different depending on the moderators. We first report the results for moderators associated with sampling issues and proceed to present the results for moderators related to methodological issues. Predictions for moderators and empirical results are summarized in Table 2.

Table 5 shows AESs and ESs in each decade from the 1970s. ESs are very positive in the beginning. The SRI movement has been initiated by social activists and religious groups who emphasize various merits of SRI. However, the initial positive atmosphere has weakened as more firms engage in CSR activities and SRI performance undergoes more rigorous scrutiny by many researchers and investors, leading to a smaller SRI impact over time. In addition, the impact of SRI tends to decrease.

This table reports descriptive statistics for the changes in the absolute value of ESs and ESs themselves through decades. The first column indicates each decade from the 1970s. There is no result for the 1980s because our sample does not have any paper published in the 1980s.

with alternating signs, and both AESs and standard deviation tend to decrease over time. This result supports Hypothesis 2-1 in that researchers find a smaller impact for SRI over time and the disagreement among them has become smaller, too. The trend of finding a positive impact of SRI is followed by an average negative impact of SRI in the next decade, which is again followed by no significant influence of SRI as expected by dialectical movements of theory development.

The meta-regression results in Tables 6 and 7 further reinforce this interpretation on research trends in SRI area. The negative coefficients for the publication year variable suggest that researchers have come to obtain smaller AESs over time.

Another interesting result regarding the time dimension is shown in Table 8. During an economic crisis, investment performance is lower than it is in a normal period. SRI is not an exception in this regard. The negative coefficients of the Crisis variable indicate that papers whose sample periods include an economic crisis tend to have smaller ESs, which is consistent with Hypothesis 2-2.

# 5.2.2. Publication status.

We run a random-effect meta-regression with AES as the dependent variable and dummies for publication status and statistical significance as independent variables to (Table 7), where tau23. indicates the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimate test Hypothesis Univariate (Multivariate) results are shown in Table 6 of between-study variance and I2res is a percentage of residual variation due to heterogeneity. Since more than 85% of residual variance is caused by heterogeneity, running a random-effect meta-regression is well justified.

Contrary to the prediction of Hypothesis 3, the sign for the publication dummy is negative and statistically significant. When combined with the statistical significance dummy, the cross-multiplication term has a negative sign, as shown in model (5) of Table 7. It suggests that among statistically significant comparisons,

Published papers have a smaller impact on AESs. This is again inconsistent with the argument of publication bias.

In addition, we perform a test for publication bias using the Egger test of Stata 14.0 and report the result in Table 9. Since the intercept is not significantly different from zero, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no publication bias. Therefore, we can conclude that publication bias is not a serious concern for our paper.

The negative coefficient for the publication variable may indicate the quality of papers. Since authors have to go through a rigorous reviewing process to publish their papers in good journals, overly affirmative or overly negative results will be toned down. Thus, if the reviewing process is more rigorous, the AES will become smaller. To examine this idea, we introduce a new variable, Quality, which captures the quality of papers. It is equal to one for journals above median ranking in the same discipline classified by Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, and zero for journals below median ranking. As can be seen in Tables 6 and 7, the coefficients of the Quality variable are negative, indicating that papers published in better quality journals tend to have smaller AESs.

# 5.2.3. Author type.

Academic researchers and industry professionals are different in many respects, including incentives for research (Vaihekoski, 2004). In academic circles, the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted, but industry professionals are more concerned with finding superior abnormal return opportunities than providing evidence that supports the efficient market hypothesis. This difference will have a dampening effect on AESs for academic researchers. Consistent with this argument, Tables 6 and 7 show that academic researchers tend to find significantly smaller AESs than industry professionals, supporting Hypothesis 4-1. When combined with the statistical significance dummy in model (7) of Table 7, the cross-multiplication term of the two variables shows a significantly negative sign. It implies that among significant results, researchers in academia tend to find lower AESs than industry professionals, which is again consistent with Hypothesis 4-1.

It is possible that researchers in different disciplines may place a different priority on social and economic values. Researchers in the finance area may put a higher priority on profit maximization than social aspects, producing results showing a.

# 5.2.4. Control group.

In general, SRI funds characteristics are not the same as those of the market index, which includes not only SRI funds stocks but also stocks of all other conventional funds. In addition, since SRI cannot have unconstrained access to whole investment opportunities, SRI portfolios are different from well-diversified market portfolios. Owing to this difference, Hypothesis 5-1 predicts that papers comparing SRI portfolios with the market index will produce larger AESs than papers comparing SRI and conventional portfolios composed by author(s) according to their research objectives. Consistent with this hypothesis, the dummy variable for market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly positive sign in Tables 6 and 7. This argument is further reinforced by the negative sign of the SRI_CI variable, which is consistent with Hypothesis 5-2. Since the difference is lower when comparing two indexes than when comparing SRI portfolios with the index, the former tends to have smaller AESs.

On the other hand, Table 8 shows meta-regression results on the influence of sampling moderators upon ESs themselves. Consistent with Hypothesis 5-3, the dummy variable for using the market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly negative sign. It implies that the relative loss of diversification is larger when SRI portfolios are compared with the market index rather than other control portfolios. The negative sign is also consistent with Luther and Matatko (1994) who obtain mostly negative excess returns of SRI portfolios when they use the market index as benchmark.

# 5.2.5. Investment universe.

In Table 8, the dummy variable for the domestic market shows a positively significant coefficient, which is consistent with Hypothesis 6. Since the cultural aspect is an important determinant of ESs, the effect of SRI will be stronger when the investment universe is domestic rather than international. Markets with a homogeneous cultural background will be affected more strongly by SRI, since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006).

# 5.2.6. Screening procedure.

Table 8 shows that SRI funds using a positive screening procedure outperform funds with a negative screening, as postulated by Hypothesis 7. This result is consistent with Humphrey and Lee (2011) who find that a positive screening significantly reduces funds’ risk, but a negative screening increases risk since it impairs the ability of funds to form diversified portfolios. More directly, Goldreyer and Diltz (1999) and Statman and Glushkov (2009) show that a positive screening has a

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Positive impact on portfolio performance, but a negative screening has a negative impact.

# 5.2.7. Mutual funds.

Performance of mutual funds is subject to various factors such as transaction costs, fees and expenditures, and managerial compensation that are largely ignored in analyses on portfolios composed by researchers. In addition, it is well known that managed mutual funds do not perform better than the market as a whole (Jensen, 1968; Carhart, 1997). Therefore, ESs on SRI mutual funds will be smaller than ESs on SRI portfolios formed by researchers. A significantly negative sign for the coefficient of mutual fund moderator in Table 8 is supportive of these arguments and is consistent with Hypothesis 8.

# 5.3. Results on Methodological Issues

In this section, we report the impact that empirical methodologies used by author(s) may have on the AES. Table 10 (Table 11) contains the results of univariate (multivariate) regressions.

# 5.3.1. Variable adjustments.

To begin with, the coefficient of the risk adjustment dummy is statistically significant with a negative sign. This is consistent with Hypothesis 9-1, indicating that the AESs calculated from risk-adjusted performance measures are systematically smaller than those calculated from raw returns. Table 12 reports the risk-adjusted performance measures used in the sample. The majority of papers use Jensen’s alpha, and only a small number of papers use the Sharpe ratio or the Treynor index (M’Zali and Turcotte, 1998). Other measures are mostly based on accounting data such as return on assets and the average ES is very large (Cohen et al., 1997). Basically, stock returns are forward looking, but accounting data are not, and it is not uncommon to have conflicting results in finance research. Moreover, the small sample size of other measures makes it difficult to draw any serious inference.

Since SRI funds have a different exposure from conventional funds to small firms, equally weighted portfolio returns can generate undeserved performance differences between the two, unlike value-weighted returns. In Tables 10 and 11, the coefficient of weighting scheme has a negative sign and is statistically significant, indicating that the value weighting scheme tends to have smaller AESs, as predicted by Hypothesis 9-2.

Hypothesis 9-3 suggests that using more accurate data can reduce the possibility of obtaining a spurious difference between SRI and conventional investments. For example, if SRI funds invest more in small firms than conventional funds, ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in SRI and conventional portfolio performance. Therefore, papers improving data accuracy by considering dividends and stock splits when calculating returns will have smaller AESs. The significantly negative sign of data accuracy variable in model (2) of Table 11 is consistent with Hypothesis 9-3 although other regressions do not show statistical significance.

# 5.3.2. Refining benchmark model.

Some authors use a single-index model as a return-generating process to compute excess returns (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005), while others use multi-factor models (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994; Gregory et al., 1997). The negative sign on the Index variable in Tables 10 and 11 suggests that the AESs calculated using multi-factor models are smaller than those calculated using a single-index model, consistent with Hypothesis 10. Since multi-index models control for more dimensions of corporate characteristics than single-index models, a spurious difference in performances between SRI and conventional portfolios tends to be smaller than in the case of using a single-index model.

In practice, fund managers change their portfolio holdings if macroeconomic conditions change, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles. In this case, conditional models are more appropriate for handling dynamic return-generating.

# 5.3.3. Matching.

Matching procedures will eliminate the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance caused by confounding factors and induce AESs to be smaller. Consistent with this argument postulated in Hypothesis 11, Tables 10 and 11 show that the coefficient of matching dummy has a significantly negative sign. In addition, the negative sign of the Match_N variable suggests that possible bias caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in one-to-one matching can be minimized by matching multiple counterparts, leading to a reduction in unwarranted differences between SRI and conventional portfolios.

# 6. Conclusions and Discussions

This article investigated the impact of SRI on investment performance in the US, using a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis makes a comparison across diverse studies possible by computing ES that is a standardized measure of impact derived from treatment and control groups.

The empirical results show that the weighted average ES is not different from zero. It is an important finding for investors since they do not have to be concerned with the possibility of sacrificing returns when they pursue investment strategies that are socially responsible.

We establish various moderators and run meta-regressions in order to examine whether ESs and AESs change systematically depending on research characteristics. For this, we split moderators into two groups, one related to sampling issues and the other related to methodological issues. To begin with, we find that ESs are positive in the earlier period and have become smaller in terms of absolute value with alternating signs as time passes. When the idea of SRI was relatively new, investors seemed to be able to earn excess returns by incorporating SRI elements in their portfolio. However, the excess return opportunity may have decreased over time and researchers seem to find a smaller impact of SRI since spurious differences between SRI and conventional investment performances are eliminated by the improvement in sampling and methodology and this pattern is by and large consistent with a dialectical development of theories. We also find that papers with sample periods containing economic crisis tend to show a lower ES, as expected.

As for publication status, we find no evidence of publication bias, so we can interpret our results without this complication caused by the publication status of papers. An interesting finding is that better quality journals show relatively smaller AESs than lower quality journals, suggesting that rigorous review processes make papers tone down unwarranted excessive claims.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Whereas the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted in academia, researchers from industry are more interested in developing a logical backup for industry practices such as active portfolio management and finding the profit potential in SRI. Owing to this difference in research incentives and environment, academic researchers tend to uncover smaller AESs than industry professionals. However, there is no systematic difference in SRI performance among scholars in different disciplines.

Obviously, the chance of having spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds becomes higher as the two groups are more different. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the AESs are bigger when SRI samples are compared with market indexes than when SRI samples are compared with conventional portfolios. And, the AESs are smaller when SRI indexes, not SRI portfolios, are compared with conventional indexes.

Studies comparing SRI portfolios with market portfolios rather than other conventional portfolios tend to show lower ESs. In addition, studies examining negative screening tend to generate smaller ESs than those with positive screening. SRI portfolios and negative screening portfolios seem to sacrifice a diversification benefit, compared with market portfolio and positive screening portfolios, respectively.

Cultural background seems to be an important factor, since domestic SRI funds tend to show higher ESs than international funds. Finally, studies of mutual fund samples show smaller ESs than those of author-composed portfolios. This is largely consistent with capital market efficiency and evidence on mutual fund performances that managed funds rarely beat the market. This result is also related to the fact that mutual fund performance incorporates all costs such as fees, transaction costs, and management compensation, whereas a comparison of composed portfolios in general does not fully take this aspect into account.

We investigate three methodological issues: variable adjustment, the refining benchmark model, and matching procedure. Regarding variable adjustment, our results indicate that any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios can be reduced by using risk-adjusted performance measures, value-weighting schemes, and more accurate variables. Refining benchmark models is related to the issue of return-generating models. Papers using multi-factor models seem to report a lower SRI impact than those using a single-index model. As for matching procedure, papers employing a matching strategy between SRI and control portfolios tend to show smaller AESs. These results suggest that researchers must try to secure similarities as much as possible to minimize a spurious performance difference between SRI and control portfolios. Researchers also have to avoid making various methodological errors.

There is a limitation to drawing a universal conclusion on the impact of SRI upon investment performance, since our empirical result is based only on the US market. However, the findings in this article can be a valid starting point for future research. A natural candidate for future research is an inter-country or inter-

regional comparison of SRI performances. Although data collection and reﬁnement and the interpretation of results based on different cultural backgrounds would be quite challenging, such a study will deﬁnitely enhance our understanding of this important issue.

As for methodology, it is true that meta-analysis is a good tool to summarize many papers on the same subject. However, a wide variety of differences among selected papers in terms of sampling and methodology is a signiﬁcant challenge when performing a sound meta-analysis. Theoretically, the SRI performance can be different depending on the research period, crisis versus normal times, security types, portfolio diversiﬁcation, social and cultural backgrounds, domestic versus international investments, and so forth. However, even though there would be only one true level of performance difference between SRI and control portfolios caused by a particular factor, researchers may ﬁnd a dissimilar performance difference if they use different research methodologies. Therefore, future research should be able to separate out more clearly a true SRI impact and the variation in observed SRI performance caused by differences in the research methodologies employed.

# Abstract

This paper provides an empirical investigation of the effect of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme on German stock returns. We find that, during the first few years of the scheme, firms that received free carbon emission allowances on average significantly outperformed firms that did not. This suggests the presence of a large and statistically significant “carbon premium,” which is mainly explained by the higher cash flows due to the free allocation of carbon emission allowances. A carbon risk factor can also explain part of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns as firms with high carbon emissions have higher exposure to carbon risk and exhibit higher expected returns.

# 1 Introduction

Since the introduction of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), carbon emissions in Europe are capped, traded and priced. The EU ETS has created a new financial market for trading carbon emission allowances that give firms the right to emit carbon dioxide. During the initial two phases of the scheme, beginning in 2005 and ending in 2012, carbon emission allowances were granted to European firms predominantly free of charge. Firms that chose to pollute more than the allowances they received had to purchase extra allowances in the open market from firms that used less allowances than they received. This has led to the emergence of the largest multinational carbon market in the world (World Bank, 2014).

This paper is at the cross-section of environmental economics and finance. As the emergence of the European carbon market is a recent phenomenon, there is little work on how environmental regulation on carbon emissions can affect the financial performance of firms. This paper fills this gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical investigation of the effect of the EU ETS on stock returns. Our empirical analysis uses data on monthly stock returns from Germany as well as manually collected data on the number of carbon emission allowances received by each firm in the sample. We focus on Germany because it is by far the largest national market for carbon emissions and accounts for a quarter of Europe’s total carbon emissions. For robustness, we also examine data from the UK.

To be more specific, the main question of our empirical analysis is the following: did the free allocation of carbon emission allowances during the initial two phases of the EU ETS generate a “carbon premium” in stock returns? We address this question empirically by designing three carbon portfolios: the “dirty”, “medium” and “clean” portfolios. The dirty portfolio is a portfolio of firms that received a high number of free carbon emission allowances, the medium portfolio comprises firms that received a lower number of free allowances, and the clean portfolio includes all firms in the sample that did not receive any allowances. We then define the carbon premium as the abnormal excess return (alpha) of the “dirty-minus-clean” portfolio, which is assessed relative to the CAPM, the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model and the Carhart (1997) four-factor model.

Our empirical analysis relies on an economic mechanism that attributes the carbon premium to two effects: the cash flow effect and the “carbon risk” effect. In terms of the cash flow effect, we show that the free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant

proÖts to carbon emitting Örms. We use the framework of Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) to demonstrate that a cap-and-trade system increases the marginal cost of production since the free carbon allowances constitute an opportunity cost to the Örm. Firms tend to respond to the higher marginal cost by increasing output prices, reducing production so that less carbon allowances are used up, switching to less carbon-intensive production technologies or a combination of these options. This is the primary mechanism that justiÖes the carbon premium as it implies that the free allocation of carbon allowances can lead to large windfall Örm proÖts.

There is also a secondary mechanism that explains the carbon premium based on the carbon risk e§ect. According to this e§ect, carbon emitting Örms will be subject to carbon risk due to uncertainty about the future price for carbon allowances, which in turn generates uncertainty about future cash áows. For example, a volatile price for carbon allowances will a§ect the cash áows of Örms. Furthermore, an institutional change in the EU ETS, such as a change in the law that initially gives carbon allowances for free but subsequently makes them available in auctions will also a§ect future cash áows. Finally, recent contributions by Weitzman (2009), Litterman (2013) and Pindyck (2013) suggest that carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk because they might face a higher price for carbon allowances in the future as a result of catastrophic climate change. In short, therefore, carbon risk is based on uncertainty about the future price for carbon emissions. As a result, carbon emitting Örms will require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions.

Our main empirical Önding is that there is a large and statistically signiÖcant carbon premium in stock returns, which can be as high as 17% per year. We show that this result holds for the sample period that ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. This sample period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the ETS that o§ered carbon allowances to Örms for free. It ends with the passing of another EU law establishing the third phase of the ETS during which carbon allowances are predominantly sold in auctions from 2013 onwards. Hence this is the period over which the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting Örms will be receiving free carbon allowances. Our evidence clearly indicates that after March 2009 the carbon premium largely disappears. The timing of the carbon premium based on German data is also conÖrmed by the UK data. Note that our main sample extends to December 2012, which is the end of the second phase of the EU ETS.

In addition to the free allocation of carbon allowances, another explanation for the large carbon premium over the relevant sample period is the effect of carbon risk on expected stock returns. We assess this effect by constructing the “dirty-minus-clean” (DMC) risk factor, which is a zero-investment portfolio defined as the expected return on a portfolio of dirty stocks minus the expected return on a portfolio of clean stocks. Then, we implement Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions to show that there is a positive price of carbon risk since dirty firms that have higher exposure to carbon risk exhibit higher expected returns. Overall, for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, carbon risk can explain a large part of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns. For this sample period, the significance of the carbon risk factor is robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables. In short, therefore, a combination of the cash flow effect and the carbon risk effect can provide a basis for explaining the high carbon premium in German stock returns over the relevant period.

In assessing robustness, we find that the carbon premium tends to be higher the dirtier the portfolio, i.e., the higher the number of allowances received by firms included in the dirty portfolio. Furthermore, the carbon premium is not diminished when we condition on changes in the price for carbon allowances and changes in the price of energy indexes such as oil, natural gas, coal and electricity.

The empirical finding that the carbon premium is present for a specific time period indicates that it may have been a one-off event that lasted for as long as the law stipulated that carbon allowances will be given for free. Specifically, this period commences about one year before the beginning of Phase I and disappears about one year into Phase II. At the same time, it is worth noting that the EU ETS is arguably the most significant multinational initiative ever taken to mobilize markets to protect the environment. As such, it has a profound impact on the development and implementation of other emission trading schemes. Over the past few years, many countries or regions have followed the EU in establishing similar cap-and-trade schemes or are currently in the process of doing so. Therefore, even if the carbon premium is a one-off event in Europe, our analysis makes an important contribution to the current environmental policy debate because it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade environmental regulation implemented elsewhere.1

1 There is a number of existing, emerging and potential emissions trading schemes around the world. For example, some of the existing emissions trading schemes include Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, California, several north-east and mid-atlantic US states, Quebec, several provinces of China and some cities in Japan. For more details, see World Bank (2014).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next two sections we review the relevant literature and the institutional details of the EU ETS. Section 4 discusses the theoretical arguments suggesting a relation between carbon emissions and stock returns. In Section 5 we describe the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 6 provides a framework for measuring the carbon premium in stock returns and discusses the main empirical results. In Section 7 we present empirical evidence on the price of carbon risk. Section 8 reports our findings on robustness and Section 9 extends our analysis by providing empirical evidence on the UK. Finally, Section 10 concludes.

# 2 Literature Review

This paper is related to three distinct lines of research that focus on different aspects of the EU ETS. One line of research evaluates the effect of movements in the price for carbon allowances on the returns of different sets of European electrical power companies. For example, Oberndorfer (2009) and Veith, Werner and Zimmermann (2009) use data from Phase I (2005 to 2007), whereas Koch and Bassen (2013) extend their sample to 2010. These studies estimate the sensitivity of stock returns to changes in the price for carbon allowances, while also conditioning on other energy factors such as price changes in oil, gas, coal and electricity. Overall, this line of research establishes a positive relation between movements in the price of carbon allowances and movements in stock prices in the European power sector.

A second line of research uses an event study methodology to isolate the effect of the sharp decline in the price of carbon allowances that took place in April 2006 on the stock returns of carbon-intensive European firms. These studies include Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) and Jong, Couwenberg and Woerdman (2014). They find that the drastic drop in carbon prices over a three-day window had a negative impact on the stock returns of carbon-intensive firms. This indicates that carbon regulation plays a significant role in determining the profits of dirty firms.

Finally, a third line of research is based on a simulation methodology that makes assumptions about the technology underlying coal-generated and gas-generated power. This analysis is adopted by Sijm, Neuhoff and Chen (2006) and Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward and Grubb (2006), who show that the introduction of the EU ETS allows power companies to realize substantial windfall profits.

A common thread across this body of research is that the main focus is to estimate the sensitivity (i.e., the beta) of stock returns to changes in carbon prices. In contrast, our empirical analysis is primarily concerned with the extent to which the abnormal excess return (i.e., the alpha) of a portfolio of dirty firms is higher than that of a portfolio of clean firms. Compared to the literature, we also adopt a different approach based on an asset pricing methodology applied on portfolios for a large set of stocks from many different industry sectors and for a longer sample. In the end, we make a distinct contribution to the literature by quantifying the effect of carbon regulation on German stock returns and the benefits to investors of holding carbon portfolios for the period when carbon allowances were granted for free.

# 3 The EU Emissions Trading Scheme

The EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide (CO2). It covers about half of CO2 emissions in all EU member states, 40% of total greenhouse emissions, and involves about 11,500 factory installations that together emit 2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. For more information on the EU ETS see Ellerman, Convery and de Perthuis (2010) and World Bank (2014).

The EU ETS works as follows. First, it sets an annual cap on the overall emissions to be allowed. Second, it allocates allowances to emitters such that the sum of the allowances does not exceed the cap. The units in which allocations are measured are called the European Union Allowances (EUAs), which give polluters the right to emit one tonne of CO2. Note that the EUAs are given to individual installations (i.e., at the plant level, not the firm level). Third, the emitters choose how much to pollute. If they pollute more than the EUAs they have received, they must purchase extra EUAs from those who used less EUAs than they received, and vice versa. This system creates incentives to polluters to reduce emissions (e.g., through technological innovations) so they can sell the surplus EUAs for profit.

As seen in the timeline presented in Table 1, the EU ETS has been implemented in three separate phases. Phase I ran from January 2005 to December 2007, Phase II from January 2008 to December 2012, and Phase III currently runs from January 2013 to December 2019. For the first two phases, the EUAs were predominantly given to installations free of charge. Note that Phase I allowances could not be banked in Phase II and hence lost their value if unused. In the third phase, the majority of the EUAs are sold in auctions. Installations

receive annual allowances in March of every year which, if used, must be surrendered by the end of April of the following year. The penalty for noncompliance is e40 per EUA not surrendered in Phase I and e100 in Phase II. The end of April is also the date when externally verified emissions are made public for each EU country. The EUAs can be traded in several trading platforms, notably the European Climate Exchange (ECX) in London, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Leipzig, and Nord Pool in Norway.

# 4 Cash Flows, Expected Returns and the EU ETS

It is well known that changes in current stock returns reflect changes in future cash flows and changes in expected returns (e.g., Campbell and Shiller, 1988). This section discusses the effect of the EU ETS on firms' cash flows (the primary effect) and expected returns (the secondary effect).

# 4.1 The Effect on Cash Flows

We begin with a discussion of how a cap-and-trade system with a free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant additional profits for carbon emitting firms. The first step in the mechanism is to recognize that a cap-and-trade system increases the marginal cost of production for the affected firms. The increase is equal to the market value of the EUAs required to produce one unit of output. Note that this is the case regardless of whether the EUAs are bought in the open market (an actual cost to the firm) or are received for free (an opportunity cost to the firm). In other words, for every unit of carbon allowances the firm uses, either it has to purchase this unit or it has to forego one unit from the surplus allowances it can sell.

Following Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010), we use the simple demand and supply diagram in Figure 1 to illustrate the effect of carbon allowances on the profits of a perfectly competitive industry.2 In the absence of carbon regulation, the initial equilibrium price and quantity are given by p0 and X0 respectively. When we introduce a cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions with a free allocation of carbon allowances, the supply curve shifts up for two reasons: (i) the higher marginal cost due to the actual or opportunity cost of the

2 The perfectly competitive firms are assumed to have constant emission rates (emissions per unit of output). See Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) for an analysis of imperfectly competitive firms with emission rates that depend on the level of output. Since the main intuition remains the same for perfect and imperfect competition, we focus on the case of perfect competition.

carbon allowances required per unit of output, denoted by r; and (ii) the higher marginal cost associated with a less carbon-intensive technology, denoted by c (fuel-switching costs). In the new equilibrium, production X1 is lower and the price pC consumers pay is higher exceeding the original marginal supply cost by c + r.

In this setup, the introduction of a cap-and-trade system with a free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant profits to carbon emitting firms. Specifically, the gain in producer surplus is represented by the shaded rectangular area A (or area pC aef), which is equal to r * X1. Note that, had the allowances been sold at auctions, area A would reflect the revenue to government. In the figure, area A appears much larger than the loss in producer surplus represented by the shaded trapezoidal area B (or area p0bdpS). If the difference of area A minus area B is positive, we can conclude that the free allocation of carbon allowances provides the firm with higher profits in the presence of carbon regulation. The size of areas A and B depends on the extent to which firms can shift to consumers the increase in marginal cost through higher output prices.

In summary, Figure 1 provides a simple but effective framework for showing the two direct effects on firm profits of the cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions. First, firms face higher marginal costs, which to a large extent are passed through to consumers through higher output prices, thus increasing firm revenue. Second, output falls and, since carbon allowances are allocated freely, the allowances not used in production can be sold for a profit. The combination of the two direct effects provides a mechanism that leads to substantial additional profits for carbon emitting firms.3

It is important to note that in the early stages of the EU ETS, there was considerable uncertainty regarding several aspects of its implementation. For example, as shown in the timeline in Table 1, the number of allowances given to each firm was made public in April 2006, which is more than two years after the EU ETS became law in November 2003. The price of the EUAs fluctuated considerably over time. There were other unknowns as well: the degree to which the opportunity cost of the allowances was incorporated into prices and the degree to which firms invested in alternative less carbon-intensive technologies. These examples indicate that, although the actual effect of the ETS on firm cash flows is expected to be positive, its exact magnitude was initially uncertain as information gradually became available.

3 The graphical illustration of Figure 1 presents a static analysis. Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) also propose an intertemporal general equilibrium model that delivers similar results. For related theoretical studies of the effect of the EU ETS on firm profits see Sijm, Neuhoff and Chen (2006), Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward and Grubb (2006), and Demailly and Quirion (2009).

available over time. This is consistent with the insights of Pastor and Veronesi (2012), who study the effect of uncertainty about government policy on stock prices and identify impact uncertainty as the uncertainty about the impact of a new government policy on firms' profitability.

# 4.2 The Effect on Expected Returns

In addition to the primary effect of the free allocation of carbon allowances, there is a secondary effect based on "carbon risk". In particular, firms that require carbon allowances are subject to carbon risk due to uncertainty about the future price for the allowances, which also generates uncertainty about future cash flows. For example, the EUA price has fluctuated considerably over time and will likely continue to remain volatile in the future. This can have an effect on future cash flows.

Furthermore, an institutional change in the EU ETS, such as a change in the law that initially gives carbon allowances for free but subsequently makes them available in auctions has a profound effect on the market's expectation of future cash flows.

Finally, recent contributions by Weitzman (2009), Litterman (2013) and Pindyck (2013) suggest that carbon emitting firms are exposed to carbon risk because they might face a higher price for carbon allowances in the future as a result of catastrophic climate change. This is because the price of carbon allowances reflects the present value of damages from emitting one tonne of CO2, which is often referred to as the social cost of carbon.4 According to Litterman (2013), carbon risk is non-diversifiable and hence will command a risk premium determined by societal risk aversion. It is true that assessing the social cost of carbon is difficult because there is great uncertainty today about: the size of future economic damages related to climate change; the probability with which they may occur; the timing of when they may occur; and the discount rate to be used in computing their present value. Given this uncertainty, as long as we cannot rule out that a climate-related economic catastrophe.

4 For example, Pindyck (2013) argues that if there is a reasonable possibility that a catastrophic climate change might occur, then the social cost of carbon in the US could reach a price of $200. This is about ten times higher than the EUA price in our sample period.

may happen in the future, dirty Örms will be subject to carbon risk. In short, therefore, carbon risk in our context reáects the uncertainty about the future price for carbon allowances. As carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk, they will require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions. This argument informs our second testing hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2)

Other things being equal, carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk and hence require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions. This is a further reason why there is a carbon premium in stock returns.

# 5 Data on Carbon Emissions and Stock Returns

# 5.1 Sample Period

The sample period used in our analysis ranges from November 2003 to December 2012. This period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the EU ETS. It ends with the expiration of Phase II and, therefore, covers only the period during which carbon allowances were given to Örms for free. Note that this sample period commences 14 months before the beginning of Phase I, which runs from January 2005 to December 2007, and covers the full span of Phase II, which runs from January 2008 to December 2012.

Throughout our analysis, we also consider a shorter sample period, which also begins in November 2003 but ends earlier in March 2009. The end date of the shorter period coincides with the passing of an EU law establishing Phase III of the EU ETS beginning in 2013 during which carbon allowances are mainly sold in auctions. Hence the shorter period captures the period over which the law stipulated the free allocation of carbon allowances. Hence during this period there was no uncertainty to Örms about whether they would receive free allowances or not. A detailed timeline of events is shown in Table 1.

# 5.2 Stock Returns

Our empirical analysis uses an extensive data set of monthly stock returns from Germany, which is the largest economy in the EU and is responsible for one quarter of EU carbon emissions. We focus on the 80 Örms currently trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which are included in the two main German stock indexes: the DAX (30 large caps) and

5 The Örst EU law was passed on October 13, 2003: Directive 2003/87/EC. The second EU law was passed on April 23, 2009: Directive 2009/29/EC.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

the MDAX (50 mid caps). Together the DAX and MDAX companies comprise more than 95% of the German stock market capitalization, which is indicative of the high degree of concentration in the German economy.

Our main analysis excludes 15 of the 80 Örms for which we do not have monthly return observations for the full sample period. Hence we employ data for the remaining 65 Örms. In the robustness section, we show that using the full cross-section of 80 Örms does not a§ect our main Öndings. Monthly stock returns are calculated as rj;t+1 = ln(Pj;t+1) - ln(Pj;t), where Pj;t is the total return index (that accounts for dividend reinvestment) of stock j at time t obtained from Datastream. The market value of equity (ME) is also taken from Datastream.

The return to the market portfolio is proxied by the DAX stock index return taken from Datastream. Our proxy for the monthly risk-free rate is the one-month money market rate reported by Deutsche Bundesbank. The Fama-French (1993) size and value factors and the Carhart (1997) momentum factor are provided by the Centre for Financial Research at the University of Cologne. These factors are especially constructed for the German economy (see, Artmann, Finter, Kempf, Koch and Theissen, 2012). Note that these factors are available until December 2012, which covers our full sample. This set of Fama-French factors for Germany has recently been studied in detail by Bruckner, Lehmann, Schmidt and Stehle (2014), who assess the factor construction and the underlying data and conclude that these factors are highly reliable. This is especially true for our sample period that begins in 2003.

# 5.3 Carbon Emission Allowances

We manually collect information on the number of carbon emission allowances given for free to each Örm using the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which is a source of veriÖed carbon emission information set up by the European Commission. Note that the CITL emission allowances are allocated by the member stateís National Allocation Plan for each individual installation of each Örm. We match each installation to the Örms it belongs to and aggregate across installations for each Örm to determine the total number of free EUAs issued to each Örm. Overall, the companies included in our analysis received about one third of the total amount of EUAs allocated in Germany. This is because a considerable proportion of the allowances were granted to utilities that are partly state-owned (hence are not public) or trade infrequently outside of the main stock indexes.

# 5.4 Descriptive Statistics

Table 2 reports monthly descriptive statistics for the 65 German stocks over the two sample periods of November 2003 to March 2009 and November 2003 to December 2012. The table indicates that Örms belong to a wide range of industries effectively capturing every aspect of the German economy. Of the 65 Örms, 24 received carbon emission allowances (the “dirty” Örms), whereas 41 Örms did not (the “clean” Örms). The number of annual allowances issued to each Örm ranges from 5,000 to 109 million. 14 Örms received more than 100,000 annual allowances and eight Örms received more than one million annual allowances. In general, the number of Phase I allowances tends to be higher than that of Phase II, especially for large polluters.

The table also reports Örm size measured by the average market value of equity (ME) as well as the annualized mean return, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio for each Örm. Overall, the sample of 65 Örms represents a high proportion of the German stock market capitalization, while capturing a wide distribution of Örms across industries, size, performance and use of carbon emission allowances.

# 6 The Carbon Premium in Stock Returns

Our empirical analysis provides a framework for investigating whether Örms that received carbon emission allowances significantly outperformed Örms that did not. In particular, we are interested in whether on average “dirty” Örms exhibit abnormal excess returns relative to “clean” Örms. In other words, our main question is whether there is a carbon premium in stock returns.

# 6.1 A Portfolio Approach

We address this question by designing three carbon portfolios: the “dirty”, “medium” and “clean” portfolios. The dirty portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which during the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received annually more than one million free EUAs. The medium portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which for the same period have received annually more than zero but less than one million free EUAs. The clean portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which have not received any EUAs. Throughout our analysis we also form the “dirty-minus-clean” portfolio, which is equivalent to going long on the dirty portfolio and short.

on the clean portfolio. This difference portfolio allows us to better understand the role of carbon allowances in determining financial performance. All portfolios are formed with equal weights.6 Note that the composition of the three carbon portfolios does not change over time since it is the same firms that each year satisfy the criteria for inclusion in the portfolios. Therefore, there is no portfolio rebalancing.

The first criterion for distinguishing between dirty versus clean firms on the basis of whether they have received free carbon allowances is natural. In the context of our data sample, 24 stocks received carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty and medium portfolios), whereas 41 did not (belonging to the clean portfolio). The second criterion for distinguishing between firms receiving a high number of carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty portfolio) and those receiving a low number of carbon allowances (belonging to the medium portfolio) is however ad hoc. Throughout our analysis, we draw the line between the dirty and medium portfolios at one million free EUAs. This implies that eight stocks belong to the dirty portfolio and 16 stocks to the medium portfolio. Note, however, that in the robustness section we comprehensively assess whether changing the composition of the dirty portfolio affects the results.

# 6.2 Portfolio Returns

Our first empirical finding is illustrated in Figure 2, which plots the cumulative returns of the dirty, clean and dirty-minus-clean portfolios for three sample periods. The first period is the pre-ETS period, which ranges from November 1998 to October 2003, and corresponds to the five years immediately before the ETS was passed into law. The second period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009, which is the period that begins with the passing of the law establishing the EU ETS and ends with the passing of the law that terminates the free allocation of allowances. The third period ranges from April 2009 to March 2014, which corresponds to the five years immediately after the second period.

The figure provides a stark contrast in the performance of the carbon portfolios before (upper graph), during (middle graph) and after (lower graph) the introduction of the EU ETS. In the five years before, the performance of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio revolves.

We use equally weighted portfolios because the cross-section of firms is not very large and hence equally weighted portfolios ensure that the performance of the carbon portfolios is not determined primarily by the largest firms. This is important since firm value in the German economy is highly concentrated in few firms. Note, however, that in unreported results we find that value weighted portfolios deliver qualitatively similar results.

12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

around zero. In the second period, the cumulative return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio increases monotonically and reaches a maximum value of about 100%. Finally, in the five years after the second period, the cumulative return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolios decreases monotonically. In short, this is preliminary evidence suggesting that firms that received carbon allowances substantially outperformed firms that did not for the period of November 2003 to March 2009, but not before or after.

# 6.3 Factor Models

Next we turn to the alpha (α) of the carbon portfolios, which is measured as the abnormal excess return relative to three standard factor models. This leads to three time-series regressions. The first regression is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is specified as follows:

rj,t - rf,t = αj + βj (rM,t - rf,t) + εj,t; (1)

where rj,t is the monthly return of portfolio j at time t for j being one of the dirty, medium or clean portfolios, rf,t is the monthly riskless rate at time t, rM,t is the monthly return to the market portfolio at time t, and εj,t is a normal error term.

The second regression is based on the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model:

rj,t - rf,t = αj + βj1 (rM,t - rf,t) + βj2SMBt + βj3HMLt + εj,t; (2)

where SMBt is the monthly return to the “small-minus-big” size factor, and HMLt is the monthly return to the “high-minus-low” value factor. We term this the F F 3 model.

The third regression is based on the Carhart (1997) four-factor model:

rj,t - rf,t = αj + βj1 (rM,t - rf,t) + βj2SMBt + βj3HMLt + βj4MOMt + εj,t; (3)

where MOMt is the monthly return to the momentum factor. We term this the F F 4 model. Note that the SMB, HML and MOM factors are specific to the German economy (see, Artmann, Finter, Kempf, Koch and Theissen, 2012).

13

# 6.4 The Carbon Premium

We define the alpha of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio as the carbon premium in stock returns. This is the abnormal excess return of the dirty portfolio over and above that of the clean portfolio. By definition, it is also equal to the difference in alphas between the dirty and the clean portfolios. The size and significance of the carbon premium is the main focus of our empirical analysis.

Consistent with our preliminary analysis, our main finding is that there is a high and significant carbon premium for the sample period that begins in November 2003 and ends in March 2009. This finding is illustrated in Figure 3, which plots a rolling estimate of the carbon premium relative to the CAPM using a three-year rolling window. Statistical significance is assessed by plotting rolling p-values of the alpha based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. Figure 3 identifies the exact timing of when the dirty-minus-clean portfolio delivers a high and significant alpha. The shaded area in the figure corresponds to the critical sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. The figure reveals that the alpha is high and significant only during this sample period but not immediately before or after. To be more specific, the figure suggests that the good performance of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio:

- (i) begins around November 2003, which is more than a year before the implementation of Phase I in January 2005;
- (ii) it then continues during all of Phase I (2005-2008);
- (iii) it diminishes in the first year of Phase II (2008); and
- (iv) it disappears afterwards.

These results are further illustrated in Table 3. Specifically, the carbon premium relative to the CAPM is 16.8% and highly significant for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, but falls to 2.9% and becomes insignificant when the sample period extends to the end of Phase II in December 2012. It is also interesting to note that in Phase I (2005-2007) the carbon premium is 15.3% and significant, whereas in Phase II (2008-2012) it is 8.2% and insignificant. The results are similar using the FF3 and FF4 factor models.

Overall, this evidence suggests that the carbon premium is present for the period that the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting firms will be receiving allowances for free. This is because:

- (i) the appearance of the carbon premium coincides with the passing of the EU law establishing the ETS with free allocation of allowances; and
- (ii) the disappearance of the carbon premium coincides with the passing of an EU law stipulating that allowances will be mainly sold in auctions beginning in 2013.

It is therefore likely that the carbon premium may have been a one-off event, which was only present during this particular period as it was.

14

driven by the free allocation of carbon allowances and lasted for as long as the law stipulated the allocation will be free.

In conclusion, the presence of a high and significant carbon premium over the sample period identified in Figure 3 is a new and important result. This finding strongly supports the first testing hypothesis (H1) implied by the economic mechanism discussed in Section 3. A high and significant carbon premium confirms empirically that carbon emitting firms are substantially overcompensated by receiving free carbon emission allowances as indicated by the theoretical work of Demailly and Quirion (2009) and Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) among others. In this context, our analysis contributes to the current environmental policy debate because, in addition to helping us understand the workings of the EU ETS, it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade environmental regulation implemented elsewhere.

# 7 The Price of Carbon Risk

This section evaluates the effect of carbon risk on the cross-section of expected stock returns. Our empirical analysis is based on Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. In line with standard practice in asset pricing, we proxy carbon risk by the “dirty-minus-clean” (DMC) risk factor. This is a zero-investment portfolio defined as the expected return on the equally weighted portfolio of the eight dirty stocks minus the expected return on the equally weighted portfolio of the 41 clean stocks. Note that the DMC factor is the expected return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio, whereas the carbon premium is the alpha of the same portfolio.

We implement the Fama and MacBeth (1973) procedure in the standard two stages. First, we use time-series regressions to estimate the betas on the CAPM, the three-factor Fama-French (1993) model and the four-factor Carhart (1997) model, while adding the DMC factor to all these specifications. In the second stage, we implement a cross-sectional regression of the average returns of all 65 stocks on their betas. The slopes of the cross-sectional regression deliver the price of risk for each factor.

For robustness, in addition to the standard four factors we also specify an industry factor as well as a series of other factors recently proposed in the asset pricing literature. The industry factor (IND) is generated by grouping the 65 stocks in 10 industry portfolios using the Fama-French industry definitions. Then, we estimate the beta of each stock on the excess return to the equally weighted industry portfolio it belongs to, while also conditioning on

15

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

the excess return of the market. We use the industry betas as an independent variable in the cross-sectional regressions and we report the price of risk. This captures the cross-sectional variation of the sensitivity to the industry factor.

We also use six additional control variables, which are specified as follows: (i) MAX is the Bali, Cakici and Whitelaw (2011) measure of the maximum daily return within a month for each stock; (ii) ILLIQ is the Amihud (2002) measure of stock illiquidity for each stock defined as the ratio of the absolute stock return to its dollar trading volume. As with the standard factors, we estimate the beta of each stock on MAX and ILLIQ separately, and then use these betas in the cross-sectional regressions; (iii) IVOL is the Ang, Hodrick, Xing and Zhang (2006) measure of idiosyncratic volatility estimated as the standard deviation of the residuals to the three-factor Fama-French (1993) regression for each stock; (iv) COSKEW is the Harvey and Siddique (2000) measure of coskewness measured as the beta on the squared excess market return for each stock, while also conditioning on the excess market return; (v) downside beta is the Ang, Chen and Xing (2006) measure of the CAPM beta using only observations for which the market return is less than its mean; (vi) and, similarly, upside beta is the CAPM beta using only observations for which the market return is greater or equal than its mean. Note that when conditioning on downside beta and upside beta, we remove the full sample beta (denoted by MKT in the table) to avoid multicollinearity.

# 4 Findings

Table 4 presents the results, which can be summarized in the following four findings: (i) for the shorter sample of November 2003 to March 2009, the DMC factor has a positive price of risk, which is highly significant in all cases. This implies that the higher a firm’s exposure to carbon risk, the higher the expected return, even when conditioning on a large number of control variables; (ii) for this sample, the DMC factor alone accounts for one-third of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns; (iii) however, when using the longer sample of November 2003 to December 2012, the explanatory power of the carbon risk factor diminishes and becomes insignificant; and (iv) overall the model specification that conditions on all control variables accounts for more than 90% of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns in either sample.

These results indicate that carbon risk can explain a large part of the variation of stock returns for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. For this sample, therefore, firms that have a high exposure to carbon risk (i.e., dirty firms) require higher expected returns. This provides direct empirical support for the second testing hypothesis (H2) for

# 8 Robustness and Further Analysis

This section extends the empirical analysis in several directions in order to assess the robustness of our main finding on the carbon premium.

# 8.1 The Carbon Premium, the EUA Price and Energy Factors

First, we provide an empirical examination of whether the carbon premium can be explained by conditioning on the price for carbon allowances and the price of energy indexes such as electricity, oil, natural gas and coal.

In line with Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009) and Koch and Bassen (2013), for the price of carbon allowances we consider monthly settlement prices of EUA futures contracts traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the European Climate Exchange (ECX). We construct a continuous price series that combines a series of contracts as follows. In Phase I, the EUA price series is equal to the price of the December 2008 contract. In Phase II, the EUA price series uses the December 2009 contract until its last trading day, then switches to the December 2010 contract until its last trading day, and so on until December 2012. Figure 4 plots the EUA futures price in euros.

Following prior literature (e.g., Oberndorfer, 2009, and Koch and Bassen, 2013), for oil, gas and coal prices we use the following one-month futures contracts: the Brent crude oil front-month forward from Independent Commodity Information Services (ICIS); the front-month natural gas forward from the ICE; and the one-month ahead New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures contract for coal converted to euros. Note that the European counterpart to this contract (i.e., the one-month ahead API 2 coal futures contract delivered to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp) is not available for the full sample but the correlation in the two series is about 90%. Finally, for electricity prices, we use the Phelix Month Base from the EEX in Leipzig as in Oberndorfer (2009).

All these data are taken from various sources. The sharp decline in the EUA price around the end of April 2006 is the focus of Hintermann (2010), Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) and Jong, Couwenberg and Woerdman (2014). These papers argue that the decline was primarily due to the release of information about aggregate EU emissions indicating an unanticipated surplus in available EUAs. For studies on the time-series behavior of EUA prices, see also Paolella and Taschini (2008), Benz and Truck (2009), and Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009).

from Datastream. In all cases, we use the price data to generate a time series for the return to each variable. For example, we compute the return to the EUA as: rEUA;t = ln(PEU A;t) - ln(PEU A;t - 1), where PEU A;t is the EUA price series at time t. Similarly, we compute roil;t, rgas;t, rcoal;t, and relec;t. We then use the dirty-minus-clean portfolio returns to estimate the CAPM with these additional explanatory variables. This allows us to assess the significance of these additional factors (rEUA;t, roil;t, rgas;t, rcoal;t, relec;t) and the extent to which they can affect the alpha of the regression (i.e., the carbon premium).

# 8.1

Table 5 reports results for two sample periods: one period ranges from May 2005 to March 2009; and the second one from May 2005 to December 2012. Note that, for this table only, we begin the regressions in May 2005 because EUA trading begins in April 2005 and hence the first observation for rEUA;t is available in May 2005.

We find that the sensitivity (beta) of the EUA, oil, gas and coal returns is positive, whereas for electricity returns it is negative. However, in all cases, the betas are insignificant. More importantly, when conditioning on these additional variables, the alpha (i.e., the carbon premium) remains largely unaffected as it is still high (about 18%) and statistically significant for the sample period that ends in March 2009. Therefore, for this sample period the carbon premium remains intact even after we account for movements in the EUA price and energy factor prices.

# 8.2 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Carbon Allowances

The carbon premium depends crucially on how the dirty portfolio is defined. Our main analysis places in the dirty portfolio the eight firms which received annually more than one million free EUAs. We assess the sensitivity of the carbon premium to the composition of the dirty portfolio with two robustness checks. For both checks, we focus on the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, when the carbon premium is found to be high and significant.

First, we maintain the same composition for the dirty portfolio that contains eight stocks, and assess whether the carbon premium is driven by any one particular stock. Figure 5 displays the alpha of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio when one of the eight stocks is dropped from the dirty portfolio. In other words, this shows the carbon premium for alternative dirty portfolios when any seven of the eight original stocks are used. We find that overall

18

The carbon premium is not driven by a single stock. The eight-stock portfolio delivers a CAPM-based carbon premium of 16.8%. The lowest CAPM-based carbon premium among the seven-stock portfolios is around 14%, which corresponds to the case of the chemical company SDF being dropped. Using any one of the seven-stock dirty portfolios gives similar results to using the eight-stock dirty portfolio. We conclude, therefore, that the carbon premium remains largely unaffected when we exclude any one stock, including the one with the largest effect.

Second, we use alternative criteria for inclusion of stocks into the dirty portfolio. As seen in Table 6, when the cutoff point of carbon allowances reduces from one million EUAs to 0.5 million EUAs, the number of stocks increases from eight to 10. Similarly, at 0.1 million EUAs, there are 14 stocks in the dirty portfolio and, finally, when all dirty stocks are included their number reaches a maximum of 24. In setting a lower number of EUAs as the criterion for inclusion in the dirty portfolio, we find that the alphas decrease monotonically. The decay is initially slow and then accelerates as more firms are included in the dirty portfolio. Specifically, the CAPM-based carbon premium is as follows: for the eight-stock portfolio it is 16.8% and significant; it decreases to 13.9% for the 10-stock portfolio and is still significant; then goes down further to 11.1% for the 14-stock portfolio and is still significant; and, finally, ends at 4.3% for the all-inclusive portfolio but now is insignificant.

These results are graphically illustrated in Figure 6. The figure shows the annualized CAPM-based carbon premium when we add one stock at a time to the original dirty portfolio of eight stocks. The stocks are added in sequence according to the number of their carbon allowances: each time the stock with the highest number of carbon allowances not already in the portfolio is added to it. The figure also shows the 95% confidence interval of the CAPM-based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The figure clearly illustrates the monotonicity in the relation of performance and carbon allowances: the more stocks we add to the dirty portfolio, the lower the number of carbon emissions the additional stock contributes to the portfolio, and the lower the CAPM of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio. This is further evidence that high carbon emissions lead to high abnormal excess returns for our sample.

# 8.3 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Firms

Our analysis uses data on 65 of the 80 firms included in the DAX and MDAX stock indexes. We exclude the 15 firms for which we do not have monthly return observations for the full sample period. For robustness, we also assess the performance of the carbon portfolios when all 80 stocks are included in the analysis. We do so by using all available data on all stocks, where for 15 stocks the data available is shorter than the full sample. This approach implies that the composition of the portfolios changes over time. The effect of the inclusion of additional stocks on the portfolio composition is as follows: the dirty portfolio still has the same 8 stocks; the medium portfolio now has a maximum of 21 stocks, which is 5 stocks more than previously; and the clean portfolio has a maximum of 51 stocks, which is 10 more stocks.

Table 7 shows that the results remain qualitatively the same and, overall, the carbon premium is in fact slightly higher. For the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, the 80-stock cross-section delivers a highly significant carbon premium relative to the CAPM of 18.6% compared to 16.8% for the 65-stock cross-section. For the full sample period of November 2003 to December 2012, the carbon premium is 4.4% relative to 2.9% previously. For Phase I it is 17.6% compared to 15.3% previously. Finally, for Phase II it is 7.1% compared to 8.2% previously. In conclusion, therefore, our main findings are not affected by the inclusion of additional stocks for which the available data does not cover the full sample.

# 9 Extension: Evidence from the UK

In this section we provide an empirical investigation of the carbon premium for a second major European economy: the UK. This allows us to assess whether the carbon premium is predominantly a feature of the German economy or a feature that is also present elsewhere in Europe. For this purpose, we build a second data set on carbon emission allowances that is specific to the UK. In particular, we focus on the 100 UK firms that belong to the FTSE 100 stock index, which capture more than 80% of the UK stock market capitalization.

In similar fashion to the German data, the UK data on carbon emission allowances have been collected manually. We use the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) database set up by the European Commission to manually match each production facility.

(installation) to the Örm it belongs to. This is a painstaking process as some Örms have numerous installations, often with di§erent names, each receiving a di§erent number of carbon allowances. All these installations are then manually matched to the parent Örm that is listed in the stock exchange. Finally, we aggregate across installations for each Örm to determine the total number of free EUAs issued to each UK Örm.

Armed with these data, we build a dirty portfolio of all 16 Örms that have received carbon allowances and a clean portfolio of all 67 Örms that did not receive any carbon allowances. Hence we use data for 83 of the 100 Örms for which we have monthly return observations for the full sample period of November 2003 to December 2012. Note that for the UK data we place all dirty Örms in one portfolio and hence we do not distinguish between dirty and medium Örms. This is because in the UK there are very few Örms with a large number of carbon allowances. For instance, had we deÖned dirty Örms as those receiving more than one million allowances, then only four Örms would satisfy this criterion. Indeed, the majority of the 16 dirty Örms received no more than 100,000 allowances. Furthermore, the market value of the average UK dirty Örm is lower than in Germany and, therefore, the average UK dirty Örm needs less carbon allowances than in Germany. Therefore, our analysis is based on the argument that the distinct structure of the UK market justiÖes placing all dirty Örms in one portfolio.

In the asset pricing regressions, we use data on UK Fama-French factors provided by the XÖ Centre for Finance and Investment at the University of Exeter. These data are speciÖcally constructed for the UK economy and are discussed in Gregory, Tharayan and Christidis (2013).

Our main Önding is that the UK results are qualitatively similar to the German results. Figure 7 plots the rolling carbon premium for the UK and shows the striking similarity between Germany and the UK. The Ögure reveals that the timing for the carbon premium in Germany and the UK is the same: the carbon premium begins at the end of 2003, grows dramatically during Phase I, diminishes in Phase II and disappears after 2009. Table 8 reports more detailed results. Notably the UK carbon premium is high and signiÖcant in Phase I but not for the other sample periods. Overall, this empirical evidence conÖrms the presence of a carbon premium in the UK that lasted for as long as it did in Germany.

# 10 Discussion and Conclusions

The EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for regulating carbon emissions. At the center of this scheme is the creation of a new market for trading carbon emission allowances. From 2013 onwards, these allowances are auctioned off at a price thus generating significant revenues for EU governments. From 2005 to 2012, however, during the initial two phases of the ETS, allowances were granted to carbon emitting firms for free. As a result, firms receiving these allowances could either sell them for profit or they could use them for production thus making these allowances an opportunity cost to be accounted for in setting prices and quantities.

The free allocation of carbon allowances in the initial two phases of the ETS is a crucial aspect of the scheme. Previous theoretical work suggests that the free allocation overcompensates firms and can lead to large increases in profits. The mechanism that leads to substantial additional profits for carbon emitting firms has two direct channels: (i) firms face higher marginal costs, which to a large extent are passed through to consumers through higher output prices, thus increasing firm revenue; and (ii) output falls and, since carbon allowances are allocated freely, the allowances not used in production can be sold for a profit. In a separate argument, carbon emitting firms are exposed to higher risk and hence require higher expected returns due to uncertainty about the future price of carbon allowances, which also generates uncertainty about future cash flows.

This paper fills a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical evaluation of whether firms that received carbon emission allowances significantly outperformed firms that did not. In particular, we examine the effect of the EU ETS on stock returns. We do so by assessing the size, significance and timing of the carbon premium, which is defined as the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of dirty firms over and above the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of clean firms in the context of standard asset pricing models. Our analysis focuses on Germany, which is the largest market affected by the ETS, but for robustness we also examine data from the UK.

Our main finding is that there is a large and statistically significant carbon premium in stock returns. The carbon premium can be as high as 17% and highly significant for the sample period that begins in November 2003 and ends in March 2009. This sample period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the EU ETS and ends with the passing of another EU law establishing Phase III of the EU ETS beginning in

2013 during which carbon allowances are mainly sold in auctions. Hence this is the period over which the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting Örms will be receiving free carbon allowances. Our evidence clearly indicates that after March 2009 the carbon premium dissipates. Furthermore, the timing of the carbon premium based on German data is conÖrmed when using UK data.

Our cross-sectional analysis indicates that for the relevant sample period, we can con- struct a carbon risk factor based on the returns of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio, which can explain a considerable part of the cross-sectional variation in expected stock returns. For this sample period, the signiÖcance of the carbon risk factor is robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables. This suggests that Örms with high carbon emissions have higher exposure to carbon risk and exhibit higher expected returns.

As a Önal note, the evidence suggests that a carbon premium is present for a speciÖc period that commences about one year before the beginning of Phase I and disappears about one year into Phase II. It is possible, therefore, that the carbon premium may have been a one-o§ event, which was only present during this particular period. Indeed, this is likely as the carbon premium is primarily driven by the free allocation of carbon allowances. Still, our analysis contributes to the current environmental policy debate because it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade en- vironmental regulation implemented elsewhere.

# Table 3. The Performance of Carbon Portfolios

The table presents the performance of carbon portfolios. Dirty is a portfolio of Örms, which during the initial two phases of the EU ETS received annually more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. Medium is a portfolio of Örms, which for the same period received more than zero but less than 1 million free carbon allowances. Clean is a portfolio of Örms, which did not receive any carbon allowances. All portfolios are formed with equal weights. The mean, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of monthly returns are reported in annualized units. CAPM-a is the alpha of a CAPM regression, FF3-a is the alpha of the Fama-French (1993) 3-factor regression, FF4-a is the alpha of the Carhart (1997) 4-factor regression. All alphas are annualized. t-statistics based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors are reported in parentheses. The asterisks *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively.

# Table 5. The Carbon Premium, the EUA Price and Energy Factors

The table presents the carbon premium, which is the alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio, for three regressions: (i) the plain CAPM, (ii) the CAPM with the log-price change to the EUA, and (iii) the CAPM with the log-price change to the EUA and the log-price change to four energy factors: oil, gas, coal and electricity. a is the annualized intercept of the CAPM regression and are the slopes on the log-price changes to the EUA and the four energy factors. t-statistics based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors are in parentheses. The asterisks *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively. The two sample periods begin in May 2005, which is the earliest month for which we have an observation for the return to the EUA. The first sample period ends in March 2009 and the second period in December 2012.

# Figure 3. The Carbon Premium

The figure plots a rolling estimate of the annualized carbon premium (solid blue line) using a three-year rolling window. The carbon premium is defined as the CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio. The figure also plots the p-value of the carbon premium (dashed green line) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The units of the alpha are shown on the left vertical axis, whereas the units of the p-value on the right vertical axis. Each alpha is plotted at the midpoint of the rolling window, thus using 18 months of data before this point and 18 months of data after. The shaded area corresponds to the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009.

The figure plots in euros the futures price of the European Union Allowance (EUA) over time. We construct a continuous price series that combines a series of contracts as follows. In Phase I, the EUA price series is equal to the price of the December 2008 contract. In Phase II, the EUA price series uses the December 2009 contract until its last trading day, then switches to the December 2010 contract until its last trading day, and so on until December 2012.

The figure displays the annualized alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio when one of the eight stocks is dropped from the Dirty portfolio. The sample period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. The original Dirty portfolio includes eight firms (ALL in the figure), which during each of the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. The horizontal axis shows the ticker of each stock dropped at a time from the Dirty portfolio. CAPM-a is the intercept of a CAPM regression, FF3-a is the intercept of the Fama-French (1993) 3-factor model regression, FF4-a is the intercept of the Carhart (1997) 4-factor regression.

# Figure 6. The Carbon Premium for More Dirty Stocks

The figure shows the annualized CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio (solid line) when we add one stock at a time to the original Dirty portfolio of eight stocks. The sample period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. The figure also shows the 95% confidence interval of the CAPM-alpha (dotted lines) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The original Dirty portfolio includes eight firms, which during each of the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. The sequence with which the stocks are added to the original portfolio is determined by their carbon allowances: each time the stock with the highest number of carbon allowances not already in the portfolio is added to it. The maximum number of stocks receiving carbon allowances is 24.

# Abstract

A variety of empirical studies analyzed the impact of board attributes on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting with mixed results during the last decade. In view of this heterogeneity and increased relevance, we conduct a meta-analysis on 51 empirical-quantitative studies and include board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size as key board attributes. We find that board independence and gender diversity are positively linked with CSR reporting. Furthermore, we examine whether this relationship is moderated by country-specific governance aspects (shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law regime). We find that board independence and gender diversity are stronger related to CSR reporting in countries with a higher range of shareholder protection and higher legal enforcement strength. We do not find any evidence for a moderator effect of code law regimes. To analyze the sensitivity of our study, we differentiate between CSR reporting measures (individual disclosure scores versus external CSR disclosure ratings) and publication quality of our included papers (journals of the ABS ranking) and found robust results. Recommendations for future research practice and regulation will be discussed.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting has been rapidly increasing by public interest entities (PIEs) since the financial crisis 2007-2008. In view of the heterogeneous use of the term “CSR”, we refer to the famous triple bottom line concept and the business case model, indicating that economic, environmental and social aspects are equal within sustainable and stakeholder-oriented management (Carroll, 1999). CSR reporting as a complement to traditional financial accounting (e.g. financial corporate governance variables and measures of CSR reporting) represents the main element of stakeholder management (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013). The main goal of CSR reports is to increase stakeholder trust in order to analyze CSR performance (Murphy & McGrath, 2013). On the one hand, the literature states that the quality of CSR reports has increased because of stakeholder awareness and pressure (Moneva et al., 2006). On the other hand, information overload and greenwashing behaviour have decreased stakeholders’ trust in CSR reporting (Mahoney et al., 2013; Ramus & Montiel, 2013).

governance and the degree of CSR reporting. In our meta-analysis, we assume that CSR reporting may be mainly influenced by: 1) board independence, 2) absence of CEO duality, 3) gender diversity, and 4) board size. We identify those four items as the most common board composition variables in empirical sustainable corporate governance research. As moderating country-specific governance variables, we include the strength of shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law systems. Furthermore, for sensitivity analyses, we compare two CSR reporting measures (individual disclosure scores versus external CSR disclosure ratings) and analyze publication quality (a reference to the ABS journal ranking). Our meta-analysis presents that board independence and gender diversity are positively related to CSR reporting and those variables are more positively linked with CSR reporting in countries with a higher range of shareholder protection and higher legal enforcement. We do not find any evidence for a moderator effect of code law regimes. In our sensitivity analyses, we found robust results.

We see a major benefit of our meta-analysis in comparison to former narrative literature reviews on that topic (e.g. Dienes et al., 2016; Hahn & Kühnen, 2013; Jain & Jamali, 2016; Malik, 2015; Velte, 2017) and in comparison to meta-analyses on related corporate governance and CSR issues (e.g. Byron & Post, 2016 (gender diversity); Ortas et al., 2017 (board independence); Majumder et al., 2017 (corporate governance attributes)). Literature reviews only give a qualitative summary on prior empirical results without measuring the total impact of board composition on CSR reporting. Thus, meta-analyses on that topic are major complements to prior literature reviews. In contrast to other related meta-analyses, we focus on selected board composition variables on the one side and CSR reporting on the other side. As CSR reporting is one of the most common variables of analyzing CSR engagement, we decide to focus on this variable and not on other measures (e.g. donations, external CSR ratings without any link to CSR reporting). CSR reporting mainly relates to corporate governance aspects, e.g. the information on sustainable management compensation or (gender) diversity on the board of directors. As researchers, regulators and companies are more and more aware of possible relationships, there is little knowledge about the overall impact of those board composition variables on CSR reporting from an international perspective. Insofar, our meta-analysis contributes to the present literature as we analyze the overall impact of the most common board composition variables by 51 papers on board composition variables and CSR reporting.

Our analysis is aimed at researchers, regulators, and practitioners alike. It provides starting points for future research activities in terms of investigating the link between board composition and CSR reporting variables. The findings also provide an important impetus for the analysis and development of recent sustainable corporate governance regulations. As already stated, board composition is currently regulated as an instrument in order to strengthen CSR reporting. Our meta-analysis will contribute to this regulatory discussion by showing the possible outcomes of these reforms. Finally, we would like to motivate corporate practice to recognize the interactions of board composition and CSR reporting activities as key elements of building stakeholder trust.

This paper is structured as follows. First, the research framework is presented from a theoretical and empirical perspective. In so doing, we first present the theoretical framework, followed by a review of the empirical literature on our board composition variables and CSR reporting and by an analysis of the moderating variables of our study (Section 2). In this context, we deduct the hypotheses of our meta-analysis. Then, the research method will be presented: criteria for inclusion, search strategy, primary study variables, moderators, and analysis strategy (Section 3). Furthermore, we present the results of our meta-analysis and the sensitivity analysis (Section 4). Finally, in our discussion, we stress the main recommendations for research, practice, and regulators (Section 5). The paper will close with our conclusions.

# 2. THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION OF THE IMPACT OF BOARD COMPOSITION ON CSR REPORTING

# 2.1. Theoretical framework

Board composition can have a positive or negative impact on CSR reporting. This assumption relies on theories based on economics (e.g. stakeholder-agency theory) that assume a positive relationship by tendency or on socio-political theories (e.g. legitimacy theory) that assume a negative connection. According to stakeholder-agency theory, CSR reporting should decrease information asymmetries and conflicts of interest between management and different stakeholder groups. Monitoring institutions such as the board of directors are an application of agency theory that enhances the decision usefulness of CSR reports. However, board directors can only fulfil the information needs of stakeholders if some requirements, e.g. board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and appropriate board size are realized. When stakeholders are satisfied with board composition and CSR reporting, a positive impact can be expected on corporate financial and CSR performance.

In contrast to stakeholder-agency theory, legitimacy theory stresses a negative relationship between board composition and CSR reporting. Organizations seek to comply with their society’s specific norms, values and boundaries by implementing innovative reporting tools, such as CSR reporting. This can enhance organizations’ image as good corporate citizens, as well as their competitive position. Legitimacy theory recognizes the risks that positive self-

# 2.2. Board composition variables and CSR reporting

# 2.2.1. Board independence

Stakeholder-agency theory stresses the importance of non-executive directors being independent of the executive directors. Board independence is a necessary condition for monitoring measures with the aim of CSR reporting that fulfils the stakeholders’ informational needs. Research has stated a positive influence of independent board members on reporting quality (Farber, 2005) as well as the quality of external audits (DeFond et al., 2005) and a reduced cost of capital (Anderson et al., 2003). Without adequate board independence, stakeholder-agency theory assumes higher management incentives to use “boilerplates” in the CSR reporting without precise information for the stakeholders or even use greenwashing strategy to manipulate the public. According to legitimacy theory, board independence can also be linked with those negative incentives of CSR reporting. This may be explained by a symbolic management strategy to appoint more independent board directors without reflection of stakeholders’ interests of CSR reporting.

Insofar, it is not surprising, that the empirical results of board independence are mixed. Among others, Das et al. (2015), Khan (2010) and Htay et al. (2012) stated a positive relationship between board independence and CSR reporting. In contrast to this, Sundarasen et al. (2016), Haniffa and Cooke (2005) and Prado-Lorenzo et al. (2012) found a negative relationship. The heterogeneous theoretical and empirical research results lead to the following hypotheses:

- H1a: Board independence is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory.
- H1b: Board independence is negatively linked to CSR reporting in line with legitimacy theory.

# 2.2.2. CEO duality

In the one-tier system, the theoretical necessity for an internal division between executive and non-executive duties on the board of directors arises from the notion that management is mainly guided by the intent to maximize its own profit and wealth on the one hand while shirking responsibility on the other (Ross, 1973; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). In the so-called CEO duality model, in which the chief executive officer (CEO) is also the chair of the board, major conflicts of interest may arise (Tirole, 1986). There are increased risks when companies carry out their own assessments, as the chairperson of the board needs to evaluate situations that are associated with his or her own functions as CEO. Thus, according to stakeholder-agency theory, the CEO duality model should be avoided. At the same time, suitable and effective management advice from the board necessitates their comprehensive knowledge of business strategy. This can be relevant in CSR reporting. Furthermore, the avoidance of the CEO duality model may be attributed to self-impression management in order to attract new stakeholders.

CEO duality is a very common board composition variable in empirical research with mixed results. Negative impacts of CEO duality on CSR reporting are stated by Muttakin and Subramaniam (2015), Li et al. (2010) and Lim et al. (2008). Among others, Jizi et al. (2014) found a positive impact. With regard to the mixed theoretical and empirical research results, the following hypotheses are stated:

- H2a: Absence of CEO duality is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory.
- H2b: Absence of CEO duality is negatively linked to CSR reporting in line with legitimacy theory.

# 2.2.3. Gender diversity

By taking gender diversity of boards into account, several arguments concerning CSR reporting can be stressed. For instance, Hillman et al. (2000) state that gender diversity provides various resources that benefit the company in terms of CSR reporting. Thus, the greater efficiency of monitoring activities can be explained by better information processing and a willingness on the part of the management to engage in dialogue (Carter et al., 2010). Many psychological studies confirmed that gender diversity may be connected with a more open mind discussion and creating innovative strategies like CSR reporting (Wood et al., 1985). Research has partly confirmed the positive influence of gender diversity on board effectiveness. Psychological researchers state that female board members are more risk-averse than their male colleagues so that they are more alike to fulfil stakeholders’ interests (Konrad et al., 2008). As CSR reporting contributes to stakeholders’ information needs, women on boards will contribute to an increased awareness of CSR reporting in line with stakeholder-agency theory. The predominance of research focusing on gender diversity on boards of directors can be attributed to its comparative simplicity of categorization as well as to the long-running socio-political debate over whether a fixed quota of women on boards should be established by law. The link between gender diversity on CSR reporting can also be negative according to the legitimacy theory. As gender diversity is a very political topic, it could be used as a symbolic strategy of management without any impact on CSR reporting quality. With regard to critical mass theory, the election of one or few female board member may be even ineffective. In view of the huge discussion of gender diversity from an international perspective, current empirical research often includes this board composition variable and finds mixed results. We recognize both positive (e.g. Kilic et al., 2015; Barako & Brown, 2008) and negative (e.g. Handajani et al., 2014) results. A current meta-analysis of former studies found a positive link between gender diversity and CSR performance (Byron & Post, 2016). As the author’s mix CSR performance and CSR reporting studies in their sample, it is not clear whether the positive

# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019

# 2.2.4. Board size

From the perspective of stakeholder-agency theory, an appropriate amount of board members seems to be most important to guarantee a good quality of board effectiveness (Jensen, 1993). But large boards can also result in flawed incentives to engage in free-rider behaviour (McConnell & Servaes, 1990). Thus, board size is a controversial corporate governance variable. In line with legitimacy theory, flexibility and dynamism of the decision-making process can be reduced as the number of board members increases (Cheng, 2008). Insufficient critical self-reflection and a lower level of process discussion can be the consequence, thereby resulting in lower board effectiveness (Lipton & Lorsch, 1992). Moreover, monitoring requirements within the board increase along with board size, which requires more resources with respect to time and special experience. Insofar, an “optimal” board size is related to individual firm factors and maybe not the best board composition indicator to influence CSR reporting.

Furthermore, the empirical results on board size are mixed. Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016), Janggu et al. (2014) and Jizi et al. (2014) found a positive impact of board size on CSR reporting. According to Abduh and AlAgeely (2015), among others, board size was negatively related to CSR reporting. With regard to the mixed theoretical and empirical research results, the following hypotheses are stated:

- H4a: Board size is positively linked to CSR reporting in line with stakeholder agency-theory.
- H4b: Board size is negatively linked to CSR reporting according to legitimacy theory.

# 2.3. Country-specific governance variables as moderators

As we argue that board composition variables on the firm level have an impact on CSR reporting, country-specific governance factors may serve as moderating variables. Common measures in empirical research are the degree of shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law systems. In line with prior research (e.g. Post & Byron, 2015; Byron & Post, 2016) and with stakeholder-agency theory, we assume that a positive (negative) relationship between board composition variables and CSR reporting will be stronger (weaker) in countries with higher shareholder protection, higher legal enforcement, and existence of a code law regime. Shareholder protection, in particular interests of minority shareholders and legal enforcement ensure an appropriate market pressure on listed companies (Post & Byron, 2015; Byron & Post, 2016). As shareholders represent one of the key stakeholders of listed firms, it is obvious, that sustainable investors with nonfinancial goals increased their influence during the last years. Code law systems are linked with an increased stakeholder focus which also highlights the relevance of CSR reporting. Thus, country-specific governance attributes support stakeholders’ interests on the firm level. This leads to the following hypotheses:

- H5: The relationship between the included board composition variables and CSR reporting is moderated by the strength of shareholder protection in line with stakeholder agency-theory.
- H6: The relationship between the included board composition variables and CSR reporting is moderated by the strength of legal enforcement in line with stakeholder-agency theory.
- H7: The relationship between the included board composition variables and CSR reporting is moderated by code law systems in line with stakeholder-agency theory.

# 3. METHOD AND DATA

# 3.1. Criteria for inclusion

Our meta-analysis focuses on the link between board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size on the one hand and CSR reporting on the other hand. To be included, studies were published in journals by September 2018 and written in the English language. Moreover, the research papers had to include an effect size or include data that could be used to calculate an effect size for the meta-analysis. The corresponding authors of studies that did not include an effect size were contacted. If the authors provided the requested data, we include the respective study in our sample for our meta-analysis. Otherwise, we exclude the research paper.

# 3.2. Search strategy and paper selection

We included empirical studies in our meta-analysis by international databases (Web of Science, Google Scholar, SSRN, EBSCO, and Science Direct). A targeted search was conducted for the keywords “corporate (social) responsibility reporting”, “corporate (social) responsibility disclosure”, “CSR reporting”, “CSR disclosures”, “sustainability disclosure”, as well as “sustainability reporting”, “environmental reporting”, and “social reporting”. Furthermore, the search was either broadened by the addition of the broader terms “corporate governance” and “board composition” or narrowed by the addition of specific variables (e.g., gender diversity). We did not limit our selection to a specific country or time. We focused on empirical-quantitative studies as the dominant research method in this field. For reasons of quality assurance, only the contributions published in international (English) journals with double-blind review were included. As of the end of September 2018, 64 studies corresponding to the selection criteria mentioned above were identified. Due to definitional differences, this set of studies was narrowed further. Our analysis is based on the definition of CSR reporting as a voluntary report as part of the annual report or a stand-alone report that covers economic, social and environmental issues in line with widely recognized CSR reporting standards, e.g. the guidelines of the GRI.

# Corporate Ownership & Control / Volume 16, Issue 2, Winter 2019

Furthermore, we do not include empirical studies with a clear focus on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon disclosure as a single dimension of CSR reporting (i.e., the ecological dimension), not in line with the triple bottom line. We do not include empirical studies on the link between board composition and integrated reporting. In comparison to a CSR report, integrated reporting conducted in according to the framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC, 2013) represents a different approach that aims to combine financial and CSR reports based on the concept of integrated thinking (Frias-Aceituno et al., 2013b; Stacchezzini et al., 2016). We only include publications with regression analyses on the link between at least one of our board composition variables and CSR reporting. This results in a final sample of 51 empirical studies.

The studies were all published or prepared within the last 14 years (2004–2018) with a clear increase in recent years. In contrast to much of the empirical corporate governance research, few studies analyzed the US-American and the European market. Developing countries were very attractive for sample selection. Cross-country studies were not common. Many of the research findings were published in accounting, corporate governance, and business ethics journals. A commonly used medium for this type of research is the Journal of Business Ethics, in which six studies were published.

# 3.3. Board composition and CSR reporting variables

Reflecting the heterogeneous literature on the link between board composition variables and CSR reporting, the studies included in this meta-analysis examined the variables in a number of ways. Although there are some critics of meta-analyses in general, our method can include studies that are diverse in terms of sample and measurement (Velte, 2018). Board independence represents our first independent variable in our study and is operationalized in different ways. Most of our included studies refer to non-executive directors. Some papers rely on a two-tier system and therefore analyze the independence of supervisory board members, on board members without being a large shareholder or external directors without managerial ownership. CEO duality is normally measured through a dummy variable and is most homogeneous. The same applies to board size as the number of directors on the board. In most studies, gender diversity was measured by the percentage of female directors. Some studies also analyzed the presence of women by a dichotomous variable. In empirical research, CSR reporting can be operationalized either by including a self-constructed CSR disclosure score or by reference to an external CSR disclosure rating (e.g. KLD, Bloomberg, AssetFour). We do not include those studies without any link to CSR disclosures (e.g. information on the existence of firm donations to CSR institutions) in order to increase comparability. In total, the included studies in our meta-analysis found mixed results with regard to the impact of board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size on CSR reporting (positive, negative and insignificant regression results) (see also Velte, 2017).

# 3.4. Country-specific variables as moderators

Three moderator variables are used in our analysis: 1) shareholder protection; 2) legal enforcement and 3) code law regime. Our first moderator variable is shareholder protection strength, which is important in country-specific governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Leuz et al., 2003). We use the shareholder protection index by the World Bank (2018) as a simple average of the extent of conflict of interest regulation and extent of shareholder governance indices. The range of the score is between 0 and 10. Our second moderator variable is legal enforcement strength. We refer to the rule of law index provided by the World Justice Project (2016) as the recognition of various factors for a country’s legal system’s effectiveness, e.g. absence of corruption and regulatory enforcement, scaled from to 1. Finally, we introduce a dummy variable 1 if the specific country in the study has a code law regime and zero if the country represents a case law regime. We refer to the classification by La Porta et al. (2008).

# 3.5. Meta-analytical strategy

The main goal of our meta-analysis is to summarize and quantify the heterogeneous results in different studies that focus on the impact of board composition on CSR reporting. A key issue in meta-analysis econometrics is the measurement of the effect size, which represents the magnitude of the relationship between the variables (Velte, 2018). In our meta-analysis, the effect size is measured by the average correlation coefficient of the included studies, and the effect size is most important to measure the influence of our board composition variables on CSR reporting. We refer to the meta-analytic technique by Hedges and Olkin (1990); (see Appendix for further information).

# 4. RESULTS

Table 1 presents the results of our meta-analysis of the link between board composition (board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size) and CSR reporting. We include shareholder protection, legal enforcement, and code law as moderating variables. All of our independent variables are positively linked with CSR reporting. Board independence and gender diversity also indicate a significant positive relationship with CSR reporting, whereas the absence of CEO duality and board size are insignificantly related to CSR reporting (Table 1). With regard to our moderating variables, both shareholder protection, and legal enforcement strengthen the positive impact of board independence and gender diversity on CSR reporting. In both situations, shareholder protection is linked with an increased effect size (0.120; 0.151) in comparison to the effect sizes without the moderator (board independence: 0.113; gender diversity: 0.140). Code law does not moderate the relationship between board independence, gender diversity and CSR reporting.

To analyze the sensitivity of our study, we differentiate between two main CSR reporting measures (individual disclosure scores versus external CSR disclosure ratings) and publication quality of our included papers (a reference to the ABS journal ranking) (Table 2). As CSR reporting measures are very heterogeneous in research, the validity of our meta-analysis may be decreased. Moreover, the quality of the included studies is also heterogeneous with regard to

# 5. DISCUSSION

Although our meta-analysis refers to board composition attributes, we are aware that there are further variables of corporate governance (e.g. external corporate governance as block holding or individual board attributes as CEO tenure). The board composition variables that were taken into consideration...

Account in previous studies have interdependencies as well and should be specified. With respect to gender diversity, it remains open to question whether women on boards have an impact on CSR reporting. Thus, it should be analyzed to what extent female directors have a positive influence on CSR reporting. The critical mass theory indicates that a critical mass of women on boards is necessary to change board attitude towards CSR strategy and reporting. Surprisingly, up to now, sustainable management compensation and the structure thereof have not been analyzed so far.

In line with these recommendations, future research should also include other board composition variables that might have an impact on CSR reporting. The first useful variable to include in future CSR research is board tenure diversity. Rao and Tilt (2016b) state that short-term relationships may contribute to limited awareness of CSR reporting because the specific board member has only little firm-specific knowledge. Another variable that is not well recognized in current research on CSR reporting is the existence of multiple directorships. According to Elsakit and Worthington (2014), the participation of the chairman of the board in discussions regarding CSR reporting is expected to have a positive impact on CSR reporting. Finally, as board diversity represents one of the main board composition variables in current empirical research, board outcome is the result of the collective discussion, so that an overall diversity variable is useful to analyze the combined effect of diversity on CSR reporting. The “Blau index” (Blau, 1977) has reached a key relevance in empirical diversity research, but not in CSR reporting research (Rao & Tilt, 2016b).

Multinational studies are not very common in our sample. There is a need for further research because a key aspect is the impact of different cultures in different countries on board composition and CSR reporting practice as a mediator, with special reference to the risk of litigation (Morros, 2016). Culture is relevant in view of the different ranges of stakeholder pressure on CSR reporting practice in a specific society. Most of our included studies contribute to developing countries and only differ between the banking industry and other industries. We encourage future researchers to focus on European member states with regard to the huge regulations on board composition and CSR reporting during the last years. It seems to be important to analyze the different branches of non-financial industries to a greater extent (e.g. pharmacy, automobiles) as the contents of CSR reporting will differ.

Our meta-analysis has also main regulatory implications. In contrast to the US-American capital market, the European legislator and other regimes (e.g. South Africa) have finalized reform initiatives on board composition and CSR reporting since the financial crisis. The intention is to increase the motives for high quality CSR reporting. However, we know very little if these regulations will positively contribute to board effectiveness and CSR reporting. The related implementation and transaction costs and the market implications of a decision-useful CSR reporting are rather a “black box”. Sustainable management behaviour won’t be generally generated by stricter regulations on board composition and CSR reporting. In order to prevent greenwashing of CSR reporting and information overflow, the board of directors must implement a sustainable vision and philosophy as a top-down approach in accordance with the total employees and permanent dialogue with related departments (e.g. finance and accounting) (Schaltegger & Zvezdov, 2015).

Practical implications can be also stressed. In general, the included studies in our meta-analysis found rather low CSR reporting scores in their descriptive statistics. Insofar, there are many possibilities for improvements in CSR reporting activities. Management should not only be aware of the reporting costs but also on the positive link on firm reputation and stakeholder trust, which could lead to better (non) financial performance in the long run. However, CSR practices may not generally be transformed into decision-useful CSR reporting (Majeed et al., 2015). Insofar, firms without CSR reporting can be active in CSR management and may plan to introduce a CSR report in the future. Even though some studies indicate that PIEs have higher CSR disclosure scores, also small and medium-sized entities are aware of CSR, especially family firms.

# 6. CONCLUSION

Empirical research on the impact of board composition on CSR reporting has increased since the last decade. As CSR reporting usually includes corporate governance information, e.g. sustainable management compensation or gender diversity, there many interdependencies between corporate governance and CSR reporting (“sustainable corporate governance”). In view of the heterogeneous results of empirical-quantitative research and with regard to the variety of board attributes, our meta-analysis focuses on common board attributes, namely board independence, the absence of CEO duality, gender diversity and board size, and their impact on CSR reporting based on 51 studies. According to our theoretical framework, we assume both a positive (agency theory) and negative (legitimacy theory) impact of our board composition variables on CSR reporting. Our meta-analysis indicates that board independence and gender diversity are positively and significantly linked with CSR reporting. Furthermore, we examine whether this relationship is moderated by country-specific governance attributes. We find that board independence and gender diversity are more positively related to CSR reporting in countries with a higher range of shareholder protection and legal enforcement. We do not find any evidence for a moderator effect of code law regimes.

We also offer recommendations to researchers, practice, and regulators in our paper. While CEO duality and board size are commonly used as board composition variables, their explanatory power is rather limited. They should be regarded as control variables and not as independent variables. Board independence and gender diversity are very common in empirical research, but other items, e.g. board expertise, multiple directorships, or board tenure, and should be also integrated. The variety of CSR reporting measures decrease the comparability of empirical research, especially by self-constructed CSR disclosure scores. But the recognition of external CSR disclosure ratings is also problematic.

in view of their “black box” character. We find that developing countries are very attractive in related empirical research. As many regulations on board composition and CSR reporting have been implemented in developed countries during the last years, other regimes should be included, e.g. EU member states with one-tier and two-tier systems and with a separation of different branches of industries.

Finally, integrated reporting research has also increased in empirical research during the last years (Frias-Aceituno et al., 2013b; Stacchezzini et al., 2016; Velte & Stawinoga, 2017). Integrated reporting should complement CSR reports as it includes material aspects of financial and nonfinancial reporting. In contrast to CSR reporting, we know little about the impact of corporate governance variables on the integrated reporting quality (Haji & Anifowose, 2016; Gerwanski et al., 2019). The applicability of recent research results on sustainable CSR reporting to integrated reporting had to be neglected owing to the divergent concepts of CSR reporting and integrated reporting. Nevertheless, recent research methods tailored to studying board composition and CSR reporting will be used for analyzing possible determinants of integrated reporting quality in the future.

# Meta-analytical strategy

The average correlation coefficient of the link between our board composition variables and CSR reporting is measured as a weighted average of the correlations obtained from the individual studies in our sample (Ortas et al., 2017). Correlation coefficients must be converted to a standard normal metric, calculated by the following expression:

ri is the correlation coefficient between the board composition variables and CSR reporting in study i. We use the transformed effects to measure the weighted average effect:

k is the number of studies in our meta-analysis and wi is the weight of each study. ̅ is the average correlation coefficient and SE ( ) is the standard deviation. Both are used to compute the appropriate confidence interval. We chose the following confidence level:

We use the following expression to convert the Fisher’s z values (average effect and confidence interval) back to a correlation:

The homogeneity of the observed correlations is analyzed by Cochram’s Q statistic as shown in:

Homogeneous correlations imply that the Q statistic follows Pearson’s distribution with k – 1 degree of freedom. If the calculated value exceeds the tabulated one for the specified level of significance, homogeneous correlations do not exist. Furthermore, we measure the level of heterogeneity according to the Higgins and Thompson I2 statistic:

The full sample is divided into different sub-samples according to the values of the discrete variables to test the significance of our included moderating effects. The approach described above is then applied to each sub-sample to analyze differences in the impact of board composition variables on CSR reporting between groups identified using the moderating variables shareholder rights, legal enforcement, and code law.

Corporate sustainability confronts managers with tensions between complex economic, environmental, and social issues. Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes, we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—and explore how differences between them in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. We explain how the two frames lead to differences in the breadth and depth of scanning, differences in issue interpretations in terms of sense of control and issue valence, and different types of responses that managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. By considering alternative cognitive frames, our argument contributes to a better understanding of managerial decision making regarding ambiguous sustainability issues, and it develops the underlying cognitive determinants of the stance that managers adopt on sustainability issues. This argument offers a cognitive explanation for why managers rarely push for radical change when faced with complex and ambiguous issues, such as sustainability, that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.

Corporate sustainability requires managers to simultaneously address widely diverging but interconnected concerns for the natural environment, social welfare, and economic prosperity (Bansal, 2002; Gladwin, Kennelly, & Krause, 1995; Maon, Lindgreen, & Swaen, 2008). As a consequence, corporate decision makers “face a great deal of ambiguity in understanding the issues, the implications of these issues for their organizations, and ways to respond to these issues” (Sharma, 2000: 683). The question of how managers make sense of such ambiguous cues from their organizational context has increasingly been addressed from a cognitive perspective (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). Through cognitive frames, which act as “cognitive filters that admit certain bits of information into the strategizing process while excluding others” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178), managers imbue ambiguous cues with meaning, which leads them to consider specific strategic responses (Weick, 1995).

Several authors have applied a cognitive lens to the analysis of corporate sustainability and related concepts, such as corporate social responsibility or corporate citizenship (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma, Pablo, & Vredenburg, 1999).

detailed analysis of the effects that cognitive frames with different content and structure have on managers’ sensemaking of the ambiguities around sustainability is still lacking (Angus-Leppan, Benn, & Young, 2010; Byrch, Kearins, Milne, & Morgan, 2007; Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). In particular, the strong focus on business case thinking (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) that permeates research on corporate sustainability (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn, Figge, Pinkse, & Preuss, 2010) has resulted in a situation where managerial responses to sustainability issues are conceptualized along an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000) dominated by economic objectives of the firm. In contrast, our aim is to generate a better understanding of the underlying cognitive determinants of different responses to sustainability issues that managers consider.

Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—to explore how differences in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas, Clark, & Gioia, 1993). The two frames are based on contrasting views of the relationship between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability and result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues. We propose that managers with a business case frame focus on environmental and social aspects that align with economic objectives and, thus, interpret sustainability issues univalently as either positive or negative for their business; hence, they adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues, with a propensity to pursue narrow but workable responses along existing routines and solutions. In contrast, with their awareness of multiple and conflicting economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame develop more ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues; as a consequence, they adopt a prudent stance, where they consider more comprehensive responses, but because of their higher awareness of risk and tensions, they move forward slowly and carefully.

As our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making by considering the effects of alternative cognitive frames on the sensemaking process of sustainability issues. Our examination of the differences in content and structure of managers’ cognitive frames offers a more sophisticated understanding of the responses to sustainability issues they consider. We offer testable propositions on the effects of the two frames on managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. Our argument results in a cognitive explanation for why managers— owing to the predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames—rarely push for radical change in the face of the immense challenges that sustainability presents. More generally, our plea to consider a greater cognitive diversity contributes to a better understanding of how managers make sense of ambiguous issues that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.

We organize the article as follows. We first develop the business case frame and the paradoxical frame with regard to their content and structure. We then develop propositions on how the two frames influence managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues, as well as on the most important factors that moderate these effects. In concluding the article we discuss key implications and offer avenues for future research.

# COGNITIVE FRAMING AND MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING

Decision makers operate in turbulent organizational contexts with complex and ambiguous signals. According to cognitive categorization theory, individuals use cognitive heuristics to make sense of such complex situations (Mervis & Rosch, 1981; Rosch, 1975). As complexity increases, sensemaking shifts from being perception based to being category based, since people’s “cognitive processing becomes schema-driven . . . and they . . . assign a handful of their direct perceptions to types, categories, stereotypes, and schemas” (Weick, 2010: 541). Correspondingly, research on managerial cognition suggests that managers interpret and make sense of ambiguous and complex signals.

through cognitive frames (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). A cognitive frame is a “mental template that individuals impose on an information environment to give it form and meaning” (Walsh, 1995: 281). These frames are produced and reproduced by individuals through labeling objects and situations according to observed attributes.

Because human rationality is bounded, managers do not achieve a complete understanding of strategic situations; rather, they use cognitive frames to “develop subjective representations of the environment that, in turn, drive their strategic decisions and subsequent firm action” (Nadkarni & Barr, 2008: 1395). Through cognitive frames managers reduce complexity and ambiguity by selectively organizing and interpreting signals from the organizational context (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). At the same time, cognitive framing occurs “on the basis of past learning and categorization” (Mervis & Rosch, 1981: 89) and, thus, is self-referring and retrospective, which results in a confirmatory bias that directs attention toward signals that fit existing frames and away from signals that are inconsistent with these frames (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Hence, cognitive framing can also limit decision makers’ understanding of a situation since it “may encourage stereotypic thinking; subvert controlled information processing; fill data gaps with typical but perhaps inaccurate information; prompt one to ignore discrepant and possibly important information; discourage disconfirmation of the existing knowledge structure; and inhibit creative problem solving” (Walsh, 1995: 282).

Following Walsh (1995), we distinguish between the content and the structure of a cognitive frame. Cognitive content “consists of the things he or she knows, assumes and believes,” while cognitive structure denotes “how the content is arranged, connected or studied in the executive’s mind” (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996: 57). The content of a cognitive frame relates to a particular domain, such as corporate strategy making (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994) or entrepreneurship (Shepherd, 1999). Within a domain, frame content captures a person’s ascription of attributes to objects and events, where an “attribute is any basis a person uses to distinguish or group objects and events” (Scott, Osgood, & Peterson, 1979: 36). Attributes that serve to differentiate objects and events into categories are said to have high cue validity (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). With regard to the structure of a cognitive frame, Bartunek, Gordon, and Weathersby suggested that the two primary dimensions are “differentiation—the ability to perceive several dimensions in a stimulus array—and integration—the development of complex connections among the differentiated characteristics” (1983: 274). Differentiation captures the number of elements within a frame, and integration describes the degree of interconnectedness among these elements (Walsh, 1995). Taken together, structure and content of a particular cognitive frame lead to a particular interpretation of a situation and, in turn, to a particular managerial response (Tikkanen, Lamberg, Parvinen, & Kallunki, 2005).

# COGNITIVE FRAMING IN MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING ON SUSTAINABILITY

Corporate sustainability “refers to a company’s activities . . . demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders” (van Marrewijk & Werre, 2003: 107). Corporate sustainability deals with a multitude of demands and objectives at organizational and societal levels that appear desirable in isolation but are “inextricably connected and internally interdependent” (Bansal, 2002: 123). It therefore produces a decision-making context with highly ambiguous signals, where decision making strongly depends on the frame managers use (Bogner & Barr, 2000; Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Kaplan, 2008). First, from the perspective of sustainability, firms need to address economic as well as environmental and social outcomes, which have to be achieved simultaneously (Elkington, 1997; Gao & Bansal, 2013). This need to address various desirable but interdependent outcomes simultaneously leads to a risk of unintended consequences, since a solution to one issue could be detrimental to that of another (Newton, 2002). Second, sustainability suggests that “business firms are expected to improve the general welfare of society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 168). This reference to multidimensional outcomes at the societal level complicates the objective function of the firm (Jensen, 2001), because it comes in addition to financial performance goals at the organizational level. Because of a strong focus on intergenerational

fairness (WCED, 1987), sustainability also “emphasizes the long-term nature of the benefit that business is expected to provide to society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 163), as opposed to the oftentimes short-term focus of managerial decision making (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012). Third, sustainability involves the simultaneous recognition of various and often conflicting demands of a wider set of stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995; Maon et al., 2008), who apply decision logics that are different from those of managers and shareholders (Hahn, in press).

Overall, sustainability confronts managers with situations in which they need to simultaneously address multiple desirable but conflicting economic, environmental, and social outcomes at firm and societal levels that operate in different time frames and follow different logics. At the same time, firms and managers are being criticized for their reluctance to adopt radical responses to address sustainability concerns (Whiteman, Walker, & Perego, 2013). To gain greater insights into corporate sustainability decision making, it is therefore critical to understand which cognitive frames managers use to cognitively process these ambiguities (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999).

# Business Case Frame and Paradoxical Frame

Many of the ambiguities that surround sustainability stem from the interrelated yet conflicting nature of economic, environmental, and social outcomes (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). We develop two cognitive frames that reflect decision makers’ assumptions regarding the relationship of these aspects of sustainability on the basis of work by Smith and colleagues (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), who suggest two approaches for managers to deal with ambiguities. The first approach is based on an alignment logic and reflects the “belief in a unitary truth [which] means inconsistencies cannot fundamentally coexist” (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 525). It holds that managers deal with ambiguities by trying to eliminate tensions—that is, they seek situations with a fit between various factors and look for contingencies that reconcile any inconsistencies (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Such a need to eliminate tensions resonates with the business case for corporate sustainability, which argues for an alignment of social and environmental outcomes with financial performance (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, & Steger, 2005). We therefore label the first cognitive frame the business case frame.

The second approach of Smith and colleagues stipulates that in complex organizational contexts tensions and inconsistencies are highly salient and cannot be eliminated (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). It emphasizes that by using paradoxical thinking managers accept tensions and accommodate conflicting yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns, rather than eliminate them (Gao & Bansal, 2013; Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Accordingly, we label the second cognitive frame the paradoxical frame (Miron-Spektor, Gino, & Argote, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the two frames.

The two frames represent ideal types (Doty & Glick, 1994) in the sense of accentuated abstractions of how managers conceive of the relationship between and among the economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. Representing the end points of a continuum, the two ideal-type frames conceptualize this relationship by either aligning environmental and social aspects with the economic dimension (business case frame) or by accepting and accommodating the interrelated yet contradictory nature of all three aspects (paradoxical frame). Since ideal types rarely exist in pure form, the actual frames of decision makers will lie between the end points and resemble the ideal types to different degrees (Doty & Glick, 1994). Actual frames thus consist of different combinations of the underlying constructs—that is, frame content and structure—of the two ideal-type frames.

Content. The content of the two frames is defined by the attributes decision makers use when they make sense of ambiguous cues and differs with regard to the dominance and diversity of these attributes. As developed above, the business case frame follows an alignment logic, which puts economic attributes first.1 Social and

1 Alignment can be based on different rationales, depending on which kinds of attributes dominate the content of a cognitive frame. Conceptually speaking, an ecological case frame or a social case frame, where environmental or social attributes dominate, respectively, would also follow an

# Characteristics of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame

|Frame Characteristics|Business Case Frame|Paradoxical Frame|
|---|---|---|
|Content|Exclusive focus on business attributes|Combination of multiple attributes with different rationales|
|Structure|Simple|Complex|
|Differentiation|Low number of frame elements|High number of frame elements|
|Integration|Low degree of connectedness with singular focus on economic means-ends relationships|High degree of connectedness with a plurality of reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting relationships|
|Implicit goal|Improve economic performance at the organizational level|Address economic, environmental, and social concerns at organizational and societal levels|
|Underlying logic|Business case thinking: Alignment of environmental and social concerns with economic objectives|Paradoxical thinking: Juxtaposition of economic, environmental, and social concerns, even if contradictory|
|Treatment of tensions|Elimination|Acceptance|

Environmental aspects are only taken into account when they can be aligned with financial contradictions (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 533)—to accommodate competing yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns that reside at different levels and operate in different logics and time frames (Byrch et al., 2007; Gao & Bansal, 2013). However, since the paradoxical frame does not systematically emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, it does not offer unequivocal guidance on which aspect of a sustainability issue to prioritize.

Structure. The differences in content and underlying logic between the two frames also influence the frames’ structure, both with regard to the number of salient frame elements (i.e., the degree of differentiation) and the complexity and multitude of connections between these elements (i.e., the degree of integration). For the business case frame, the strong focus on economic attributes results in comparatively low degrees of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is low because the economic focus limits the number of attributes represented. Integration is also low because, owing to its emphasis on aligning environmental and social concerns with financial performance, this frame only considers connections between frame elements that are based on hierarchical means-ends relationships. Other, more complex relations, where social and environmental aspects do not align with financial performance, are not taken into account. However, the consideration of only a limited set of connections does allow managers with a business case frame to eliminate inconsistencies and tensions (Smith & Tushman, 2005).

The inclusiveness of this frame results in a higher degree of differentiation since it accommodates frame elements covering all three sustainability dimensions. While the high degree of differentiation refers to the inclusion of a wide variety of attributes, this frame also has a higher degree of integration since it takes into account different reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting connections between and among sustainability dimensions.

# Relationship Between the Two Frames

As noted above, the business case frame and the paradoxical frame represent two ideal-type conceptualizations of how managers relate economic, environmental, and social concerns to each other. They represent the end points of a continuum, with a full alignment with economic objectives at the one end and a combination of interrelated yet conflicting economic, environmental, and social concerns at the other end. Although as ideal types the business case frame and the paradoxical frame are distinct, actual frames represent different combinations of content and structure of the two ideal types (see Figure 1). Starting with the business case frame at the one extreme, once a frame starts to include salient environmental and social attributes, in addition to economic attributes, its content gets more diverse and its structure more differentiated (upward move in Figure 1). With the number of frame elements increasing, the number of possible connections between elements grows disproportionately. The higher the number and the greater the diversity of frame elements, the more complex and diverse the interconnections. Hence, the cognitive frame has a higher degree of integration, which will eventually result in the paradoxical frame at the other extreme (rightward move in Figure 1). The more a frame is rooted in an alignment logic (business case frame), the greater its focus but the lower its complexity. In contrast, the more a frame uses paradoxical thinking (paradoxical frame), the higher its complexity but the lower its focus.

We propose that these two ideal-type frames are useful heuristic devices to understand managerial decision making in a sustainability context. We now develop the consequences of each frame for the process of managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues. Exploring the consequences of the two cognitive frames provides a more comprehensive understanding of managerial cognition on ambiguities around sustainability (Walsh, 1995).

# SENSEMAKING OF CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE BUSINESS CASE FRAME AND THE PARADOXICAL FRAME

Sensemaking occurs as a sequence of three core processes: scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas et al., 1993). Below we develop the differences in terms of managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues depending on whether decision makers hold a business case frame or a paradoxical frame. In the scanning phase decision makers reduce the amount and complexity of information, and, depending on the frame they hold, notice different aspects of a situation, in turn leading to differences in their information processing and interpretation of the situation. In the interpretation phase any given situation may be understood as relevant by some but perceived as irrelevant or completely overlooked by others (Barr & Huff, 1997). Assigning more or less relevance and specific meaning to the information then has consequences for the managers’ strategic response.

# Scanning

“Scanning involves information gathering; it usually is considered an antecedent to interpretation and action” (Thomas et al., 1993: 240). Because of their cognitive limitations, decision makers are exposed to more information than they can process (Mintzberg, 1973); hence, “executives can perceive only a selected portion of the environment” (Das & Teng, 1999: 764). Decision makers scan information according to the relevance they assign to it based on their cognitive frames (Hambrick, 1982; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Owing to the confirmatory bias of cognitive framing, they selectively notice information that conforms to their cognitive frames and ignore information that contradicts these frames (Nickerson, 1998; Palich & Bagby, 1995). They also fill gaps with frame-consistent information and tend to miss extreme or highly surprising information because it escapes their cognitive categories (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).

Important aspects of scanning refer to the depth and breadth of the information that managers collect (Beyer et al., 1997; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988) on sustainability issues (Mazutis, 2013). Information collection operates on a continuum between, at one extreme, focused search, where decision makers are looking for specific information with a clear purpose in mind, and, at the other extreme, general browsing through information, “without a particular problem to solve or question to answer” (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997: 83). Regarding the breadth of perceived aspects, Beyer and colleagues found that “the more restricted the observational goals of decision makers, the more selective their perceptions will be” (1997: 720). Similarly, the more managers attend to selected targets and previously formed hypotheses about the relationship between different aspects, the more “they might overlook information and evidence that may prove the opposite” (Das & Teng, 1999: 762). That is, a priori objectives and hypotheses selectively highlight particular cues from the organizational context (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988).

The business case frame, with its content built on economic attributes and its structure based on an alignment logic, provides managers with strong direction but, at the same time, restricts observational goals. We thus expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a rather narrow portion of the information on a sustainability issue. They will more easily absorb information they perceive as having business relevance and that is structured similar to other business information, which is very often expressed in quantitative terms (Daft & Weick, 1984). For instance, the publication of the “Stern Review” attracted managerial attention because it presented monetary estimates of the economic damage caused by climate change. Crucially, the report presented climate change as a business opportunity, stressing the benefits of early action as a way to prevent the costs of remaining inactive (Stern, 2006).

Decision makers with cognitive frames of low complexity also tend to collect information from fewer selected sources (Karlins, 1967; Stabell, 1978). Accordingly, managers with a business case frame will limit their attention to sustainability-related claims of stakeholders closely related to the market environment, since these will be perceived as more powerful and relevant for business (Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997). People tend to stereotype information depending on its source (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), so decision makers with a business case frame will attend less to environmental and social issues brought forward by stakeholders having no direct im-

pact on their business. For instance, in the 1970s General Motors’ upper management did not consider many suggestions for smaller, less polluting cars because they were brought forward by groups outside the scope of the executives’ focus (Wright, 1979). Consequently, managers with a business case frame will not take full notice of the multitude of sustainability issues and claims that arise in their organizational contexts. The more the frames of decision makers focus on economic attributes and an alignment logic, the more decision makers tend to perceive issues only once these have progressed to later stages of the issue life cycle—that is, when actors with direct business relevance, such as regulators or competitors, have adopted the issue (Mahon & Waddock, 1992; Wartick & Mahon, 1994).

While the business case frame limits the breadth of managerial scanning, it enables managers to approach decision situations with known objectives (Das & Teng, 1999). Following an alignment logic, managers probe the environmental and social aspects they notice for potential economic benefits. With this narrow focus the business case frame provides clear direction and reduces uncertainties regarding which aspects managers should look for (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). The clear focus on the business relevance of sustainability issues allows managers to employ highly formalized and clearly structured search routines to collect detailed information (Das & Teng, 1999). Consequently, we expect that managers with a business case frame will be more likely to collect detailed information on how selected sustainability issues contribute to financial performance. Overall, we argue that the business case frame will lead managers to notice rather few sustainability issues but to seek detailed information, based on readily available, quantitative information at advanced stages of the issue life cycle, on how selected aspects of these issues relate to financial outcomes (see Figure 2).

# Proposition 1a:

The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a narrow range of sustainability issues based on focused search with little breadth, but with detailed information on how these issues relate to economic objectives.

# FIGURE 2

Effects of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame on Scanning

The paradoxical frame does not direct decision makers toward clearly defined objectives and previously formed hypotheses about one specific type of relationship between different sustainability aspects. Rather, we expect managers with this frame to have a less selective perception of sustainability issues (Beyer et al., 1997). With their more complex frame structure and frame content comprising more diverse economic, environmental, and social attributes, decision makers will scan more broadly and attend to a wider range of aspects of sustainability issues, even if they are contradictory. Moreover, as Stabell argued, decision makers with complex frames will tend “to combine the information from a wide variety of information sources as the individual is able to generate perspectives that can integrate such a diversity of information” (1997: 720). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame will thus gather more diverse information on sustainability issues—that is, information related to economic, environmental, and social aspects—irrespective of immediate financial implications (Byrch et al., 2007). Because they hold a more complex conceptualization of their business (Crilly & Sloan, 2012), they will gather quantitative and qualitative, as well as financial and nonfinancial, information. They will also take note of opinions held by a wider range of stakeholders (Daft & Lengel, 1986; Wong, Ormiston, & Tetlock, 2011) and notice signals from diffuse sources with little or no immediate relevance.

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 471

diate business relevance, as well as from earlier stages of the issue life cycle (Halme, 2002; Wartick & Mahon, 1994). Since the structure of the paradoxical frame encompasses conflicting relations between different sustainability dimensions, decision makers will be more likely to notice redundant and inconsistent information. Their information collection will be less structured and less formalized, because increasing formalization “constrains the information that decision makers can take into account” (Heidmann, Schaffer, & Strahringer, 2008: 246). For instance, biodiversity represents an issue that is still at an early stage in its life cycle, and managers struggle with how to make sense of it (Financial Times, 2012). Since biodiversity relates to many different ecological processes, managers need to scan beyond traditional business sources to comprehend the complexity of the issue. Hence, the CEO of global cement firm Holcim initiated a partnership in 2007 with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an environmental NGO dedicated to biodiversity, to collect independent expert opinion on the relevance of biodiversity for Holcim (Imboden, Gross, Meynell, Richards, & Stalmans, 2010).

However, the paradoxical frame does not emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, so it does not provide an unequivocal direction for information collection. Scanning might be broad, but also rather vague, since breadth comes at the expense of detailed information search (Das & Teng, 1999). With their complex and broad frame, managers may perceive too many issues and aspects as potentially relevant (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Owing to their limited cognitive capacities (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), decision makers cannot collect, process, and store detailed information on a wide range of sustainability aspects, as well as on the complex interconnections between them; hence, uncertainties will remain. While decision makers can cope with tensions and uncertainties through paradoxical thinking, their scanning will remain inconclusive. Overall, we expect that the less their cognitive frame is focused on alignment, the wider the variety of aspects of numerous sustainability issues managers will notice but the less they will be able to collect detailed information on the various aspects of these issues and their interrelations (see Figure 2).

# Proposition 1b:

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a wide range of aspects of numerous sustainability issues based on broad browsing, but with a lack of detailed information.

Since cognitive frames are acquired and learned through a manager’s career history (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Porac & Thomas, 2002), we expect that the functional background of decision makers will influence their scanning of strategic issues (Beyer et al., 1997; Sutcliffe & Huber, 1998; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988). According to previous research, functional background influences the breadth and depth of scanning, because managers with different functional backgrounds favor different search modes (Beyer et al., 1997). Managers with a background in internally oriented functions, such as engineering, accounting, and finance, have the tendency to be more task oriented and to focus more on internal efficiency (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), as well as on unidimensional and clearly structured outcomes (Thomas & Simerly, 1994). They are thus more likely to perform focused search in a structured and formalized manner (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). Managers from externally oriented functions, such as marketing, research, and product development (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), are more often exposed to situations where stakeholder demands are in conflict (Maon et al., 2008). Hence, they tend to be “more adept at recognizing the multiple demands of their stakeholders [and the] competing interests of their constituents” (Thomas & Simerly, 1994: 962). These managers are more familiar with collecting information through broad and less structured browsing (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). We therefore expect that managers with a background in externally oriented functions will tend to scan more broadly but in less detail, while those with an internally oriented functional background will tend to scan less broadly but in more detail (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 2).

# Proposition 2a:

Decision makers with a background in externally oriented functions will scan more broadly but with less detail, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on scanning.

# Academy of Management Review

# Proposition 2b

Decision makers with a background in internally oriented functions will scan less broadly but with more detail, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on scanning.

Managers’ perceptions of ambiguous cues from the organizational context are not only constrained by their cognitive capacities and personal characteristics but also by situational factors. When dealing with conflicting information and disparate stakeholder interests, managers usually do so under time pressure and resource limitations (Mann & Tan, 1993). Hence, scholars often argue that a greater availability of resources will enhance managers’ ability to collect more detailed and broader information on sustainability issues, since collecting and processing information on a broad range of sustainability issues is time consuming and costly (Bansal, 2005; Bowen, 2002; Sharma, 2000). Additional time and resources “can facilitate search activity which is not necessarily problem-related” (Bowen, 2002: 311) and can provide the latitude to perform searches on aspects and issues that may not have an immediate payoff (Levinthal & March, 1981). However, we argue that the effect of resource availability on managerial scanning of sustainability issues will not be categorical. The breadth of scanning by managers with a business case frame is not primarily limited by a lack of time or resources but, rather, by the focus of the frame content on economic attributes and by its alignment structure. Even with abundant resources, these managers are not likely to perform a broader search. They will still fail to notice information on sustainability issues that is presented in nonfinancial, qualitative terms and that has an ambiguous relation to financial outcomes. Conversely, the information search of managers with a paradoxical frame is limited by their capacity to collect and process detailed information on a broad range of sustainability issues. Part of this limitation will be due to their limited cognitive capacities to handle large amounts of information (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). However, the availability of additional time and resources will allow these managers to collect more detailed information on the broad range of sustainability issues they have noticed. We therefore suggest the following relation between resource availability and scanning (see the dotted curve in Figure 2).

# Proposition 3

The availability of additional time and resources will enable decision makers with a paradoxical frame to scan in more detail but will not increase the breadth of scanning of decision makers with a business case frame.

# Interpreting

“Interpretation is the act of carving out meaning from ambiguous cues and is the very core of the sensemaking process” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178). As research on strategic issue diagnosis suggests (Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993), managers interpret strategic issues by assessing different aspects of those issues against the categories of their cognitive frames. Individuals with different cognitive frames will attach different labels to information in order to understand it and will interpret information differently (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). Accordingly, we expect that decision makers with a business case frame will interpret the ambiguities of sustainability issues differently from decision makers with a paradoxical frame.

Managers commonly interpret strategic issues in terms of two dimensions: sense of control over the issue and valence of the issue—that is, their evaluation of the issue as positive or negative (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Plambeck & Weber, 2010). The perceived sense of control reflects the extent to which a manager believes “in his or her ability to effect a change, in a desired direction” (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986: 165). Sense of control is neither a stable personality trait, since it can change over time and differ according to the issue or situation at hand, nor is it objective (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986). Rather, it represents a subjective perception and may even be an illusion (Langer, 1975). With regard to the valence of an issue, in previous work on strategic issue diagnosis, researchers tended to assume that decision makers usually classify an issue as either positive or negative (Chattopadhyay, Glick, & Huber, 2001; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; George, Chattopadhyay, Sitkin, & Barden, 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Sharma, 2000; Thomas et al., 1993). More recently, how-

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 473

ever, organizational scholars have devoted attention to ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues (Fong, 2006; Gilbert, 2006; Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). While univalent interpretations denote an issue as being clearly positive or negative, ambivalent interpretations attach competing positive and negative evaluations to various aspects of an issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010).

We argue that managers’ cognitive frames will play an important role in their perceived sense of control and valence of sustainability issues. Their perceived sense of control depends on what information is available to them (Thomas et al., 1993) and how that information is collected (Das & Teng, 1999). “High levels of information use among top managers will be positively related to their interpretation of strategic issues as controllable” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243). Moreover, the more managers believe they understand cause-and-effect relationships between different aspects of an issue, the higher their sense of control will be (Sharma et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 1993). With their frame content focused on economic attributes and frame structure based on an alignment logic, managers with a business case frame will have the clear goal of identifying and gaining a detailed understanding of sustainability issues that contribute to economic objectives. Consequently, we expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they have noticed.

The sense of control will be heightened by their highly structured and formalized search and assessment routines, which have a clear problem focus (Das & Teng, 1999). Since they will systematically probe into how sustainability issues relate to financial performance, they will tend to be confident about their ability to understand the nature of this cause-and-effect relationship. As an example, Royal Dutch/Shell managers defended their plans for oil drilling in the Arctic against criticism from environmental NGOs and competitors by highlighting their positive evaluation in terms of business opportunities and their ability to control potential spills. Through a spokesperson, Shell’s top managers argued that “at Shell, we believe the Arctic has significant untapped potential and will play an increasingly important role in meeting the energy challenge” and emphasized their sense of control by stating that “our experience working in rigorous and challenging conditions in the Arctic means that we are qualified to do the job right—to explore for offshore oil and gas in Alaska in a very safe and careful way” (The Guardian, 2012: 35).

Based on “a feeling that no stone has been left unturned” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243), they will have a high sense of mastery and control over sustainability issues.

Decision makers assess issue valence by evaluating those aspects of an issue they have noticed against the categories of their cognitive frame (Petty, Brinol, & DeMarree, 2007). Rudolph and Popp (2007) found that individuals with strong directional goals tend to interpret issues univalently—that is, as either clearly positive or clearly negative. Because of the strong direction, decision makers with a paradoxical frame will no-

Decision makers notice a wide range of aspects of a sustainability issue. This broad and inclusive approach will increase their sense of control over sustainability issues, since they believe they will not have missed any important dimension of the problem (Das & Teng, 1999). On the other hand, because of the more complex structure of their frame, decision makers will accept that there are tensions and conflicts between different economic, environmental, and social aspects that can never be fully resolved (Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, in press; Smith & Lewis, 2011). This heightened awareness of conflict will lower their sense of control over the issue (Das & Teng, 1999). Overall, then, we expect decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a moderate sense of control over sustainability issues.

The greater diversity of the paradoxical frame also affects the valence of the evaluation of sustainability issues. “Ambivalent evaluations are likely to arise when executives examine more diverse aspects of an issue, which itself is in part driven by the [cognitive] frameworks employed in the process” (Plambeck & Weber, 2010: 692). Research in environmental psychology (Castro, Garrido, Reis, & Menezes, 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004) shows that the multidimensionality of sustainability issues spurs ambivalent issue interpretations. For instance, domestic waste recycling has been found to simultaneously induce both positive evaluations—satisfaction about showing ecological behavior—and negative evaluations—doubts about the overall effect of personal efforts when others do not recycle as well (Castro et al., 2009). With a very low sense of control, decision makers will perceive issues to be beyond their own influence, which will lead them to disengage from the issue and fall back on simpler univalent assessments. With a very high sense of control, decision makers will also evaluate issues univalently because they are overly confident that they can master an issue with existing resources.

routines and fail to consider alternatives (Miller, 1993). Overall, we expect managers with a paradoxical frame, and the resulting moderate sense of control, to experience enough control to handle diverse and competing aspects of an issue, but not enough control to rely excessively on routine evaluations. As a result, such managers will more likely apply distinct and competing positive and negative evaluations simultaneously (see Figure 3).

# Proposition 4b:

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to perceive a moderate sense of control over a wide range of sustainability issues and to interpret these issues ambivalently.

Since managerial sensemaking of strategic issues is embedded in an organizational context, organizational identity has been suggested as a critical factor affecting interpretation (Bundy, Shropshire, & Buchholtz, 2013). Organizational identity represents the shared beliefs about the central, distinctive, and enduring features of an organization (Albert & Whetten, 1985). It guides and filters individuals’ interpretation of strategic issues, shaping the meanings given to an issue (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Walsh, 1995). Organizational identity defines what aspects decision makers see as positive or negative and what are seen as legitimate interpretations (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). We therefore expect that the effects of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame on issue valence will be moderated by organizational identity.

A homogeneous identity leads to a single uncontested conceptualization of what is central, distinctive, and enduring about the organization. With its strong self-reinforcing dynamic (Fiol, 2002), a homogeneous identity keeps organizational members focused on organizational goals (Pratt & Foreman, 2000). In the case of a unitary “business” identity (Albert & Whetten, 1985), the “competitive business model in which success is measured in terms of above-market returns and ever-increasing growth rates is more deeply ingrained in . . . beliefs and practices” (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009: 448). Decision makers are primed by such existing routines and are therefore less likely to integrate a diverse set of aspects in their interpretation of strategic issues (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that include nonbusiness aspects tend to be delegitimized. In contrast, a heterogeneous identity (Gioia, Schultz, & Corley, 2000; Pratt & Foreman, 2000) admits more diverse aspects and, thus, makes ambivalent evaluations more likely (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Organizations with heterogeneous conceptualizations of their central, distinctive, and enduring features accommodate multiple interpretations (Gioia et al., 2000) and tend to have more complex relationships with a wide spectrum of external stakeholders (Brickson, 2005). In such organizations decision makers are more likely to integrate conflicting sustainability aspects in their issue evaluations, because their organization’s identity allows for attending to a wide variety of competing stakeholder demands (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009).

# Proposition 5a:

Decision makers in organizations with a homogeneous business identity are less likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on interpretation.

# Proposition 5b:

Decision makers in organizations with a heterogeneous identity are more likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on interpretation.

Given the role of resource availability as an important contextual factor in strategic issue diagnosis (Dutton & Duncan, 1987), we expect resource constraints to also moderate the influence of cognitive frames on the interpretation of sustainability issues. Resource constraints influence both managerial sense of control and issue valence. In cases where “resources are abundant, decision makers are more likely to feel a sense of control . . . with respect to an issue, than when organizational resources are limited” (Denison, Dutton, Kahn, & Hart, 1996: 459), because they have the means available to deal with the issue adequately (Jackson & Dutton, 1988). In contrast, with limited resources, decision makers feel constrained by their context in the choices they can make and, thus, experience a loss of control (George et al., 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988). A lack of resources also makes ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues less likely, since managers tend to lack the time and resources to investi-

gate a greater diversity of aspects of the issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2010).

We expect that resource constraints will particularly influence the interpretation of sustainability issues under a paradoxical frame. Having only a moderate sense of control to start with, decision makers’ sense of control will be further reduced by resource constraints, since these individuals lack time and resources to process the broad range of aspects they perceive. In addition, in times of economic distress, financial aspects are more likely to come to the fore owing to increased shareholder pressure. This will reduce managers’ leeway to consider a wider range of environmental and social aspects that potentially conflict with financial performance. Managers will therefore be forced to take sides and interpret sustainability issues less ambivalently. However, they will feel that this more univalent interpretation is imposed on them rather than being the result of their own reasoning, which will further reduce their sense of control. In contrast, when managers with a business case frame operate under resource constraints, they will still seek univalent interpretations. Resource constraints tend to reinforce their reliance on routine procedures to ascertain the business relevance of sustainability issues in order to maintain control (George et al., 2006). Hence, resource constraints will affect such managers to a lesser degree. They will continue to settle univalently for either positive or negative evaluations, even with a low sense of control (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). We therefore suggest the following relationship between resource availability and managerial interpretation of sustainability issues (see the dotted curve in Figure 3).

# Proposition 6:

A lack of time and resources will induce decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a lower sense of control over sustainability issues and to interpret sustainability issues more univalently but will not affect the interpretation of decision makers with a business case frame.

# Responding

Once managers have interpreted ambiguous sustainability issues based on their cognitive frame, they will act on that basis. While the cognition of an individual decision maker alone will not determine organizational responses to sustainability issues, we expect that different cognitive frames will lead managers to adopt different decision-making stances. We define stance as a decision maker’s rationalized mental attitude toward an issue, which predisposes the individual to act in certain ways. We argue that the different effects we expect for the two frames with regard to depth and breadth of scanning (Mazutis, 2013) and issue interpretation in terms of sense of control and issue valence (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; Plambeck & Weber, 2009) will result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues—that is, either a pragmatic stance or prudent stance. We further characterize these two stances by discussing the scope, novelty, swiftness, and riskiness (Plambeck & Weber, 2009) these different types of responses entail.

As developed above, managers with a business case frame focus in detail on selected aspects of sustainability issues to understand their relevance for economic objectives. Based on focused search routines, they develop a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they perceive and tend to evaluate these issues univalently as either clearly positive or negative for their business. Consequently, we expect these managers to consider responses that either actively approach an issue—in the case of a positive evaluation—or actively avoid it—in the case of a negative evaluation (Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). To develop these responses, they refer to existing solutions that have been successfully applied to similarly interpreted issues (Ocasio, 1997): they “access common solutions when faced with common situations that are clearly positive or negative” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). Being based on incremental adaptations of routine response patterns to positive or negative business issues, the responses these managers consider will be limited in scope. This narrow focus on business routines will enable decision makers to simplify complex sustainability issues (Porac & Rosa, 1996) and to come up with swift responses once they have evaluated an issue as being relevant for economic objectives (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

The search for responses to sustainability issues that are in the vicinity of existing solutions also reduces the perceived riskiness and novelty of these responses (Plambeck & Weber,

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 477

With their high sense of control based on formalized search and assessment routines, as well as existing solutions (George et al., 2006), decision makers with a business case frame tend to underestimate the risk of the responses to sustainability issues that they consider. By relying on established routines to ascertain the profitability of environmental and social investments, such as formal investment appraisal procedures (Epstein & Roy, 2003), and by referring to known solutions, such as incremental improvements of existing technologies (Hart, 1995), they strongly believe in their ability to handle and control risk (Das & Teng, 1999). The higher their sense of control, not only the lower the perceived risk but also the greater the likelihood that risk will be underestimated and the more optimistic the forecasts managers will make about the outcomes of their responses to an issue (Durand, 2003; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Consequently, these decision makers will be willing to consider investments of considerable magnitude as long as these do not entail radical departures from established routines but rely on skills and solutions, which they perceive they are able to master.

When responding to regulatory pressure in the European Union for lower carbon emissions during the 2000s, top management of carmaker Volkswagen followed a pragmatic stance and developed the BlueMotion line of more fuel-efficient cars based on incremental improvements of its trusted diesel technology (Financial Times, 2007). This stance, however, came at the expense of developing alternative propulsion systems, such as electric vehicles, that required a departure from existing technologies. At the same time, the BlueMotion line was deployed swiftly across the entire model range, resulting in a large-scale response. Even if this reliance on incremental improvements of conventional technology was probably insufficient to meet more stringent emission regulations in the future, Volkswagen management seemed confident in its focus on responses with limited scope but high controllability (Financial Times, 2011).

Overall, we expect that holding a business case frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by pragmatism. With this stance decision makers prefer “workable” solutions to sustainability issues based on strategies that remain within existing technological systems, producing as little disruption as possible (Prasad & Elmes, 2005). On the one hand, such a stance is rather parochial, since managers only consider responding to those aspects of a sustainability issue for which they perceive immediate business relevance; they will discard other aspects and fail to develop a comprehensive perspective of the issue. On the other hand, their focus on workable solutions is more likely to lead to concrete measures and responses that are actually implemented, thus “proposing working solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems” (Prasad & Elmes, 2005: 850).

Proposition 7a: The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues.

Building on their broad but less detailed scanning on a wide range of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame experience a moderate sense of control and develop ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that integrate positive as well as negative evaluations with regard to economic, environmental, and social outcomes. This ambivalence simultaneously activates response patterns for approaching positive and avoiding negative aspects (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Plambeck & Weber, 2009). Managers will consider not only environmental and social aspects that provide financial benefits but also aspects where such benefits are unclear, or even unlikely. Their cognitive ability to accommodate conflicting aspects enables them to consider responses with a broader scope that are internally consistent, but “may be inconsistent or contradictory across [responses]” (Smith, Binns, & Tushman, 2010: 449). However, the higher cognitive complexity associated with ambivalence impedes swift responses (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996), since decision makers take more time to assess and integrate more diverse and potentially competing aspects of a sustainability issue (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

Because ambivalence activates a broad set of positive as well as negative evaluations of a sustainability issue simultaneously, managers with a paradoxical frame tend to perceive issues as unique. Consequently, they feel that these issues cannot be adequately addressed through existing solutions and routines, and this

triggers a search for alternative responses (March & Simon, 1958). During the search for alternative responses, the activation of different response patterns increases the “likelihood of finding multiple [yet competing] responses that match the issue” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). This brings together response repertoires that are usually applied separately—for instance, working with peripheral stakeholders, such as social activists (Hart & Sharma, 2004), while defending established business practices. While decision makers with a paradoxical frame perceive a greater novelty of the responses they consider, their tendency to see sustainability issues as unique problems also heightens the perceived riskiness of their responses (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Managers with a paradoxical frame do not underestimate the riskiness of potential responses because they lack established routines and have only a moderate sense of control. Rather, they accept that there is some uncontrollable risk. To handle risk they avoid taking a stand on the issue too early and keep their options open (Das & Teng, 1999). Thus, while decision makers with a paradoxical frame see the need to consider novel and unusual responses that go beyond existing routines, they are aware of the risk that is associated with such responses. In particular, they are aware that addressing sustainability issues comprehensively entails conflict and undesired side effects. As research in environmental psychology has shown, this awareness of ambivalent effects of more comprehensive responses to sustainability issues lowers the propensity to take concrete action (Castro et al., 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004).

Recent debates on sustainability issues in agribusiness—food security, biodiversity loss, and genetically modified seeds—illustrate the impact of ambivalence on the types of response decision makers consider. For example, Unilever’s sustainability manager recently conveyed an ambivalent position on organic agriculture by emphasizing a reluctance to go fully organic because this would jeopardize food production on the usual scale (NRC, 2013). Yet at the same time Unilever’s upper management pioneered novel sustainable agriculture practices (Whiteman et al., 2013). These have resulted in innovative practices for sustainable agriculture but have had limited business impact, since “it was difficult (at the time) to translate the treatments involving extreme reductions in fertilizers and pesticides into marketable stories” (Pretty et al., 2008: 57–58). Ambivalence on the part of Unilever’s management regarding organic farming led to innovative solutions going beyond using established routines, but these innovations were used on a small scale only.

Overall, we expect that holding a paradoxical frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by prudence. On the one hand, with their comprehensive view on sustainability issues, these managers will see the need to consider responses that break with established routines and business practices in order to achieve environmental and social benefits at the societal level. On the other hand, they will be aware of “the massive uncertainty and unpredictability, nonlinear interaction between system components, unknown thresholds, and complex dynamics in ecological and social systems” (Gladwin et al., 1995: 879) and, hence, tend to approach sustainability issues by moving slowly and carefully (Das & Teng, 1999). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame might even perceive sustainability issues as overly problematic, which would prevent them from envisaging workable solutions and assuming responsibilities for their practical implementation (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).

# Proposition 7b

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a prudent stance on sustainability issues.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Our main objective in this article is to develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We advance theoretical understanding of the stance managers take on sustainability issues by proposing how two ideal-type cognitive frames, with their differences in content and structure, affect the stages of the sensemaking process of ambiguous issues. In previous research scholars have underlined the importance of managerial cognition and sensemaking of sustainability (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Byrch et al., 2007; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999); we add to this literature by offering a more fine-grained understanding of the role individual cognition plays in managerial decision making on corporate sustainability. By address-

ing a wider variety of alternative cognitive frames, we advance research in corporate sustainability, which so far has almost exclusively relied on business case thinking (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2010).

As our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making on sustainability issues. Building on previous work on the role of interpretation of sustainability issues in explaining strategic choice (Sharma, 2000), we uncover the effects of differences in cognitive frames on the underlying sensemaking process that links cognition with a manager’s decision-making stance. This cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability connects to a number of key aspects of the debate on managerial interpretations of and responses to sustainability issues. For instance, while the strategic management literature has recently drawn attention to the role of ambivalent issue interpretations (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010), the corresponding debate in the sustainability literature has remained within an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000). We advance this field of research not only by introducing ambivalent managerial interpretations of sustainability issues but also by elaborating on the cognitive determinants of univalent and ambivalent interpretations. In previous research on the antecedents of managers’ ambivalent interpretation of strategic issues, scholars have focused on organizational factors (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Our cognitive framing perspective adds individual-level factors to the picture. While Barr, Stimpert, and Huff (1992) found that decision makers’ cognitive frames link cues from the organizational context to managerial decision making, we explain how differences in the content and structure of a manager’s frame act at the different stages of the sensemaking process.

As another important implication, we add to research on the different types of responses managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. In this context, a manager’s sense of control and perception of risk have been discussed as key determinants of the choice of different responses (George et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 1993) and of associated decision-making biases (Das & Teng, 1999; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Our analysis of the effects of differences in frame content and frame structure sheds new light on the sometimes contradictory implications that have resulted from the application of different theoretical lenses to managerial risk and perceptions of control (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; George et al., 2006). We suggest that with different cognitive frames managers’ sense of control over an issue may stem from fundamentally different sources. Likewise, we expect managers to perceive and deal with the riskiness of potential responses differently, depending on which of the two frames they hold. These cognitively determined differences have important implications for managerial decision making on ambiguous sustainability issues. The pragmatic and prudent stances that we expect to be associated with the business case frame and the paradoxical frame, respectively, suggest that commonly used classifications of issue responses along general classifications, such as the reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive (RDAP) scale (Clarkson, 1995; Wartick & Cochran, 1985), may be too simplistic. Managers with a pragmatic stance favor responses of limited scope based on established routines and practices, which considerably limits their proactiveness, yet their propensity to develop workable solutions can potentially bring about large-scale change. Managers with a prudent stance may consider unusual and more radical departures from established routines, yet they are hampered in their ability to implement workable solutions because of their ambivalence and higher awareness of risk and tensions. The often-bemoaned reluctance of firms and their managers to address in a radical fashion the immense challenges that sustainability presents (Whiteman et al., 2013) may thus be rooted in the cognitive predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames. Owing to their pragmatic stance, managers with a business case frame rarely consider deviating from established routines but rely instead on incrementalism; paradoxically minded managers may well see the need to consider bolder responses to sustainability issues but shy away from such endeavors since they are hampered by ambivalence and prudence.

This argument highlights the need to address the interplay of the two cognitive types, since both business case and paradoxical frames have their role to play in bringing about change but may operate at different stages. Because they go beyond a focus on economic attributes alone, the relatively few managers with a more

paradoxical frame might act as pioneers to propose comprehensive responses that depart from existing routines. However, the translation of these responses into practice may well require managers with a more business case–oriented frame, who are cognitively predisposed to reducing the complexity of sustainability issues to a level that enables the implementation of these novel practices at a large scale. Neither of the two frames alone will be sufficient to bring about managerial responses that measure up to the immense challenges sustainability presents.

The interplay of different cognitive types has various practical and theoretical implications. With regard to managerial practice, in the nascent field of sustainable human resource management (Ehnert, 2009), the composition of teams of different cognitive types may play an important role in the management of sustainability issues. Mirroring findings on the combination of different cognitive styles in the composition of successful innovation teams (Miron-Spektor, Erez, & Naveh, 2011), teams dominated by either business case–minded or paradoxical types may be less successful in implementing innovative responses to sustainability challenges than mixed teams. By avoiding a strong bias in such teams toward one of the two cognitive types, firms can make sure they remain aware of the complexity of sustainability issues (due to the presence of paradoxical types) without losing sight of the need to implement workable solutions (due to the presence of business case types).

Our argument also has theoretical implications for the growing body of literature on hybrid organizations. While this literature conceptualizes conflicting financial and social goals in terms of competing institutional logics (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Pache & Santos, 2013), our focus on the interplay of different cognitive types highlights the relevance of individual-level factors when organizations face competing demands. Our argument suggests that the presence of decision makers who accept competing financial, environmental, and social objectives through paradoxical thinking (Smith, Gonin, & Besharov, 2013) might not be sufficient. Rather, the coexistence and the interplay of different cognitive types, where some are aware of tensions but others are not, appear to play a critical role not only for the management of corporate sustainability in for-profit firms but also for the successful implementation of hybrid business models.

Finally, we believe that addressing a greater cognitive diversity of managers promises considerable further insights into the nature and contingencies of managerial responses to issues other than sustainability that are also characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects and where the debate is also dominated by a business case perspective. For instance, diversity in organizations represents a complex issue that scholars and managers alike often frame as having business value (Herring, 2009; Robinson & Dechant, 1997). Here, too, business benefits are unclear (Cox & Blake, 1991), and critical voices call for approaches that go beyond business case thinking (O’Leary & Weathington, 2006). We expect that considering alternative frames on such an issue will shed new light on how and why decision makers approach diversity issues in different ways.

We propose two ideal-type cognitive frames through which individuals make sense of sustainability issues, based on different views on how economic, environmental, and social dimensions relate to each other, a key debate in corporate sustainability (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). However, we acknowledge that frames can be based on various rationales (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). Cognitive perspectives that correspond to other debates within the corporate sustainability literature will result in alternative ideal-type frames and promise further insights into the effects of frame content and structure on managerial responses to sustainability issues.

While not being exhaustive, Table 2 offers a starting point for exploring such alternative frames. One set of frames may form around governance issues, exploring the question of who is responsible for taking action to address sustainability concerns—for example, private sector versus state (Matten & Crane, 2005; Reinhardt, Stavins, & Vietor, 2008). Other frame sets could relate to the discussion of different motivations to take action on sustainability—for example, altruism versus (enlightened) self-interest (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Jensen, 2001)—or could address the different time dimensions that are being discussed in the sustainability literature—for example, present generations versus future generations (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

We contribute to the discussion of alternative cognitive frames by going beyond a descriptive typology (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999) to address in detail the effects of differences in frame content and structure. However, we do not suggest that any particular frame automatically determines the sensemaking of decision makers. Rather, we expect that the effects of managers’ cognitive frames on their decision making will be moderated by a range of personal, situational, and contextual factors. We propose that the effects of the two frames on scanning and interpretation will be attenuated by the functional background of managers and by organizational identity, respectively. In addition, our argument on the availability of resources illustrates that not all frames are susceptible to contextual factors. Some cognitive constraints, as in the case of narrow scanning by business case–minded decision makers, cannot be simply overcome by providing abundant resources, whereas in other instances—for example, with the sense of control of paradoxically minded managers—resource constraints prevail over cognitive predispositions. The moderators we propose provide only an initial step toward understanding the various factors that influence the role of cognitive frames. We are aware that there are further relevant moderating factors, beyond the individual- and the organizational-level factors we address, providing ample opportunities for future research into a cognitive framing perspective on managerial sensemaking of ambiguous issues. It would be particularly fruitful to address the moderating role of institutional factors since these prime and trigger cognitive frames (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research could thus investigate how multiple, competing institutional logics (Besharov & Smith, 2014; Jay, 2013) moderate the effect of cognitive frames on sustainability decision making.

Another relevant question for future research refers to the origin of cognitive frames. Since managers’ frames “do not spring up randomly, but rather are the encoding of their prior history” (Kaplan & Tripsas, 2008: 791), we would expect that a range of factors at personal, organizational, and institutional levels will influence the formation of cognitive content and structure. With regard to personal background, researchers have argued that personality traits, such as need for closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) and tolerance for ambiguity (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), play an important role in sensemaking under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity (McKenzie, Woolf, van Winkelen, & Morgan, 2009). With regard to the organization as a context for managerial decision making (Gioia & Thomas, 1996; Weick, 1979), the influence of organizational structure on managers’ cognition (Hannaway, 1985) may differ between centralized and decentralized organizations (Pugh et al., 1963). Moreover, since managers’ cognitive frames are shaped by the particular institutional fields they have been exposed to (Weber & Glynn, 2006), dominant and contested institutional logics (Purdy & Gray, 2009; Reay & Hinings, 2009) may prime different cues and privilege certain frames over others (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research into the antecedents of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame will help us to understand who the managers are that are more likely to adopt a pragmatic or a prudent stance on sustainability issues.

Our focus on cognition at the individual level raises the question of how different cognitive frames and the resulting decision-making.

stances relate to organizational action (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993). We see at least two key aspects at the interface between individual cognition and organizational action that merit further investigation: the activation of frames and the dominance of frames. A better understanding of the factors that trigger a stronger or weaker activation of the two frames promises relevant insights. Such factors may be found within the organization—for instance, in an organizational climate of participation (Tesluk, Vance, & Mathieu, 1999) and creativity (Ekvall, 1996)— or outside the organization—in major regulative, technological, or economic discontinuities (Griffith, 1999; Tushman, Newman, & Romanelli, 1986). Moreover, since managerial cognition is a social process within an organizational context (Daft & Weick, 1984), individual frames will only translate into organizational action when they are transformed “into the organization’s predominant collective frames” (Kaplan, 2008: 730). Collective cognitive frames are the outcome of a political process where organizational members compete over the dominant interpretation of an issue (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991). Future research could address the factors that enable decision makers to translate their own cognitive frame into the dominant collective frame. Overall, further development of the cognitive framing perspective may result in a more comprehensive theory that establishes a connection among individual history, cognition, and agency.

We believe that our cognitive framing perspective and our propositions provide ample opportunities for future empirical studies. Given the nascent state of research into tensions and cognitive diversity in sustainability, scholars may find it most fruitful to use both quantitative and qualitative methods (Edmondson & McManus, 2007). However, testing our propositions through quantitative research presupposes the development of measurement scales for the business case frame and the paradoxical frame. To gain insights into the cognitive processes of decision makers who use business case frames or paradoxical frames, (semi-)qualitative methods, such as interviews, content analyses, and exploratory case studies, will be particularly suitable (Gregoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2010; Luscher & Lewis, 2008).

In conclusion, we believe that a cognitive framing perspective offers a better understanding of managerial decision making on sustainability issues by recognizing the importance of a greater cognitive diversity of managers with regard to the content and structure of their frames. Our goal in this research, therefore, has not been to advocate a specific cognitive frame but, rather, to pave the way for the consideration of different cognitive perspectives on complex and ambiguous issues, such as corporate sustainability.

# Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis

# Authors

Marc Orlitzky, Frank L. Schmidt, Sara L. Rynes

# Abstract

Most theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions. With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP–CFP relationship than is currently assumed to exist by many business scholars.

# Introduction

The performance of business organizations is affected by their strategies and operations in market and non-market environments (Baron 2000). The increasing power of activist groups and the media in pluralist western societies can be expected to make organizations’ non-market strategies even more important. One construct that might capture a major element of these non-market strategies is corporate social performance (CSP). CSP can be defined as ‘a business organization’s configuration of principles of social responsibility, processes of social responsiveness, and policies, programs, and observable outcomes as they relate to the firm’s societal relationships’ (Wood 1991a: 693).

The impression that ‘in the aggregate, results are inconclusive’ regarding any theoretical conclusions about the relationship between CSP and corporate financial performance (CFP) has persisted until today (Jones and Wicks 1999: 212; cf. also Donaldson 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999). Ullmann (1985) and Wood and Jones (1995) argued that during the past three decades of empirical research on this relationship, researchers have engaged in a futile search for stable causal patterns. A number of narrative reviews and theories (for example, Aupperle et al. 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Husted 2000; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wartick and Cochran 1985; Wood 1991a, 1991b; Wood and Jones 1995) have proposed conceptual explanations for the existence (or lack thereof) of a causal relationship between CSP and CFP, but failed to provide clear answers. Previous reviews of this area have suggested that such factors as stakeholder mismatching (Wood and Jones 1995), the general neglect of contingency factors (for example, Ullmann 1985), and measurement errors (for example, Waddock and Graves 1997) may explain inconsistent findings. Other authors, failing to see important differences between theory and operational context, are even more pessimistic and call for a moratorium of CSP–CFP research (Margolis and Walsh 2001; Rowley and Berman 2000). Before we embark on a costly search for contingencies or abandon a line of inquiry altogether, a theoretically and empirically meaningful integration of this area might be useful. In this article, we argue that this line of inquiry contains a number of theoretical conclusions that have hitherto been overlooked or ignored by many organizational scholars.

This article presents a meta-analytic review of primary quantitative studies of the CSP–CFP relationship. Meta-analysis has proven to be a useful technique in many substantive areas where multiple individual studies have yielded inconclusive or conflicting results (for example, Damanpour 1991; Datta et al. 1992; Gooding and Wagner 1985; Schwenk 1989; see also Hedges 1987; Hunt 1997; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001; and Schmidt 1992 for broader reviews of meta-analysis). By statistically aggregating results across individual studies and correcting for statistical artefacts such as sampling error and measurement error, psychometric meta-analysis allows for much greater precision than other forms of research reviews. Ironically, those researchers that question the meaningfulness of the CSP–CFP research stream the most (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001) have integrated the empirical evidence with the so-called ‘vote-counting’ technique, which, for a variety of reasons, has been shown to be invalid by many statistical experts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Rosenthal 1995; Schmidt 1992). When, in ‘vote counting’, studies are simply coded as showing significantly positive, negative, or statistically non-significant results, conclusions are likely to be false (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In contrast, psychometric meta-analysis quantifies the impact of theoretical and methodological deficiencies in a given line of inquiry and is, therefore, at present, the most sophisticated research-integration technique.

The specific objectives of this meta-analysis are to: (1) provide a statistical integration of the accumulated research on the relationship between CSP and CFP.

CFP; (2) assess the relative predictive validity of instrumental stakeholder theory in the context of the CSP–CFP relationship; and (3) examine several moderators, such as operationalization of CSP and CFP (that is, measurement strategies) and timing of CSP and CFP measurement. In so doing, it builds on earlier research by: (a) including market (stock) return measures in addition to accounting returns; (b) including CSP measures other than social-responsibility audits performed by Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc.; (c) responding to Waddock and Graves’ (1997: 315) call for research on the temporal consistency of results, independent of the time lag chosen between CSP and CFP measures; and (d) integrating empirical results across diverse study contexts and enabling us to look for theoretical moderators and statistical artefacts that might explain the highly variable results across previous studies.

# Theory and Hypotheses

# Overall CSP–CFP Relationship

Instrumental stakeholder theory (for example, Clarkson 1995; Cornell and Shapiro 1987; Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Mitchell et al. 1997 (the classification of these studies as exemplifying ‘instrumental stakeholder theory’ was made ex post)) suggests a positive relationship between CSP and CFP. According to this theory, the satisfaction of various stakeholder groups is instrumental for organizational financial performance (Donaldson and Preston 1995; Jones 1995). Stakeholder-agency theory argues that the implicit and explicit negotiation and contracting processes entailed by reciprocal, bilateral stakeholder–management relationships serve as monitoring and enforcement mechanisms that prevent managers from diverting attention from broad organizational financial goals (Hill and Jones 1992; Jones 1995). Furthermore, by addressing and balancing the claims of multiple stakeholders (Freeman and Evan 1990), managers can increase the efficiency of their organization’s adaptation to external demands.

Additionally, according to a firm-as-contract analysis (Freeman and Evan 1990), high corporate performance results not only from the separate satisfaction of bilateral relationships (Hill and Jones 1992), but also from the simultaneous coordination and prioritization of multilateral stakeholder interests. These strategic and tactical steps may be necessary to reduce the likelihood of the organization’s becoming stuck in a high-density network. High network density can reduce CFP in a number of ways (Rowley 1997). For example, in a high-density network, firms may become stuck in the role of compromiser or subordinate, depending on the degree of the firm’s network centrality (Rowley 1997). Either of these roles may lead to further consumption of valuable firm resources such as time, labour, and capital. Conversely, high CSP bolsters a company’s competitive advantage by weighing and addressing the claims of various constituents in a fair, rational manner. This perspective, which is primarily derived from instrumental.

stakeholder theory (Jones 1995), has also been identified as the ‘good management theory’ (Waddock and Graves 1997). Therefore, we predict that:

# H1:

Corporate social performance and financial performance are generally positively related across a wide variety of industry and study contexts.

# Temporal Sequence

Like the ‘good management theory’, slack resources theory also proposes a positive association between CSP and CFP. However, it proposes a different temporal ordering — namely, that prior CFP is directly associated with subsequent CSP. Prior high levels of CFP may provide the slack resources necessary to engage in corporate social responsibility and responsiveness (Ullmann 1985; Waddock and Graves 1997). Because CSP often represents an area of relatively high managerial discretion, the initiation or cancellation of voluntary social and environmental policies may, to a large extent, depend on the availability of excess funds (McGuire et al. 1988).

To distinguish between slack resources theory and the good management theory, the meta-analytic data set will be examined for three sets of temporal associations: (a) prior CSP related to subsequent CFP; (b) prior CFP related to subsequent CSP; and (c) contemporaneous (cross-sectional) associations. If effect sizes are highly similar across all three meta-analytic subgroups, Waddock and Graves’s (1997) argument about a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP would be supported irrespective of study context, sampling error, and measurement error. Based on prior theory and empirical findings (McGuire et al. 1990; Waddock and Graves 1997), we believe that both instrumental stakeholder theory and slack resources descriptions are accurate, such that the two constructs are related to each other reciprocally.

# H2:

There is bidirectional causality between corporate social performance and financial performance.

# Mediating Effects

CSP may be an organizational resource that provides internal or external benefits, or both. Internally, investments in CSP may help firms develop new competencies, resources, and capabilities which are manifested in a firm’s culture, technology, structure, and human resources (Barney 1991; Russo and Fouts 1997; Wernerfelt 1984). Especially when CSP is pre-emptive (Hart 1995) and a firm’s environment is dynamic or complex, CSP may help build managerial competencies because preventive efforts necessitate significant employee involvement, organization-wide coordination, and a forward-thinking managerial style (Shrivastava 1995). Thus, CSP can help management develop better scanning skills, processes, and information systems, which increase the organization’s preparedness for external changes, turbulence, and crises (for example, Russo and Fouts 1997).

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

which are acquired internally through the CSP process, would then lead to more efficient utilization of resources (Majumdar and Marcus 2001). According to the ‘internal resources/learning’ perspective, whether CSP behaviours and outcomes are also disclosed to outside constituents is largely irrelevant to the development of internal capabilities and organizational efficiency.

In addition, however, CSP may have external effects on organizational reputation. According to the reputation perspective, an organization’s communication with external parties about its level of CSP may help build a positive image with customers, investors, bankers, and suppliers (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Firms high in CSP may use corporate social responsibility disclosures as one of the informational signals upon which stakeholders base their assessments of corporate reputation under conditions of incomplete information (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Furthermore, firms with high CSP reputation ratings may improve relations with bankers and investors and thus facilitate their access to capital (Spicer 1978). They may also attract better employees (Greening and Turban 2000; Turban and Greening 1997) or increase current employees’ goodwill, which in turn may improve financial outcomes (Davis 1973; McGuire et al. 1988; Waddock and Graves 1997). In sum, the reputation perspective postulates reputational effects as mediators of the CSP–CFP linkage, while the internal-resources perspective proposes managerial competencies and learning as the intervening generative mechanism between a positive CSP–CFP association. Therefore, we propose that:

# H3: CSP is positively correlated with CFP because (a) CSP increases managerial competencies, contributes to organizational knowledge about the firm’s market, social, political, technological, and other environments, and thus enhances organizational efficiency, and (b) CSP helps the firm build a positive reputation and goodwill with its external stakeholders.

# Measurement Strategy: An Important Moderator Variable

Because both CSP and CFP are such broad meta-constructs, a given study’s operationalization of each construct may act as an important moderator. To test this hypothesis, the entire meta-analytic set is broken down into different CFP and CSP subsets employing different measurement strategies. This breakdown can establish whether correlations between different CSP and CFP measures are similar across subgroups, or whether different operationalizations lead to systematically different effect sizes across studies. The following section gives an overview of how CFP and CSP have been measured in the past.

The three broad subdivisions of CFP consist of market-based (investor returns), accounting-based (accounting returns), and perceptual (survey) measures. First, market-based measures of CFP, such as price per share or share price appreciation, reflect the notion that shareholders are a primary stakeholder group whose satisfaction determines the company’s fate (Cochran).

# Organization Studies

# 24(3)

The bidding and asking processes of stock-market participants, who rely on their perceptions of past, current, and future stock returns and risk, determine a firm’s stock price and thus market value. Alternatively, accounting-based indicators, such as the firm’s return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), or earnings per share (EPS), capture a firm’s internal efficiency in some way (Cochran and Wood 1984). Accounting returns are subject to managers’ discretionary allocations of funds to different projects and policy choices, and thus reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external market responses to organizational (non-market) actions. Lastly, perceptual measures of CFP ask survey respondents to provide subjective estimates of, for instance, the firm’s ‘soundness of financial position’, ‘wise use of corporate assets’, or ‘financial goal achievement relative to competitors’ (Conine and Madden 1987; Reimann 1975; Wartick 1988).

The construct of CSP is associated with the following four broad measurement strategies: (a) CSP disclosures; (b) CSP reputation ratings; (c) social audits, CSP processes, and observable outcomes; and (d) managerial CSP principles and values (Post 1991). First, CSP disclosure measurement consists of content analysis of annual reports, letters to shareholders, 10Ks, and a number of other corporate disclosures to the public as surrogates of CSP. Content analysis is employed to compare units of text against particular CSP themes in order to draw inferences about the organization’s underlying social performance (Wolfe 1991).

A second approach to measuring CSP is the use of reputational indices, such as Moskowitz’s (1972, 1975) tripartite ratings (‘outstanding’, ‘honourable mention’, and ‘worst’ companies; for example, Cochran and Wood 1984; Sturdivant and Ginter 1977) or Fortune magazine ratings of a corporation’s ‘responsibility to the community and environment’ (for example, Conine and Madden 1987; Fombrun and Shanley 1990; McGuire et al. 1988). Other researchers (Alexander and Buchholz 1978; Heinze 1976; Vance 1975) have developed their own reputational measures by surveying business professionals and business students. Reputation indices are based on the assumption that CSP reputations are good reflections of underlying CSP values and behaviours.

Social audits and concrete observable CSP processes and outcomes are the third broad measurement category of CSP. Social audits consist of a systematic third-party effort to assess a firm’s ‘objective’ CSP behaviours, such as community service, environmental programmes, and corporate philanthropy. Objective data are the foundation for so-called ‘behavioural’ measures of CSP. However, behavioural measures based on social audits may still result in a ranking, such as the measure provided by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP). Various studies have used the CEP social audit rankings of companies’ pollution records (for example, Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Fogler and Nutt 1975; Spicer 1978; see also the overview of studies in Appendix A). Although this subset of studies differs from the other three subsets, it is still very broad. Therefore, this third group will be broken down further to examine the instrumental effectiveness of processes of social responsiveness.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

The fourth measurement category of CSP assesses the values and principles inherent in a company’s culture. Aupperle (1984) developed a forced-choice survey of corporate social orientations, drawing on Carroll’s (1979) corporate social responsibility construct with its four dimensions of economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities. The last three elements comprise the construct ‘concern for society’. Volume 12 of Research in Corporate Social Performance and Policy (Post 1991: Part III, 265–401) reviews in greater depth the history and psychometric properties of the different CSP measures briefly delineated here (Aupperle 1991; Carroll 1991; Clarkson 1991; Gephardt 1991; Wokutch and McKinney 1991; Wolfe 1991; Wolfe and Aupperle 1991).

Differences in CSP–CFP statistical associations across these four measurement subsets may result from three sources. First, there might be ‘real’ (substantive) cross-study variation in correlations between CSP and CFP, as predicted by Wood and Jones’s (1995) mismatching thesis. Wood and Jones (1995) argued that effects would vary depending on expectations and evaluations of CSP, which differ from one stakeholder group to another. No positive correlations would be expected between measures that cannot be linked theoretically, such as CSP disclosures and accounting-based efficiency measures of CFP. For example, Wood and Jones’s (1995) review suggested that the match between market measures and market-oriented stakeholders (for example, customers) would produce significant positive results, while the correlation between market measures and charitable contributions, for instance, would not.

Alternatively, differences in correlations across variable measurement subsets may simply be a function of statistical artefacts. For example, if one measurement subgroup were found to contain many studies with very small sample sizes, this subgroup would show a relatively large random sampling error. Thus, differences in sampling error across measurement subgroups may explain CSP/CFP correlational differences in primary studies. In addition, measurement error of CFP and CSP (that is, unreliability) might act as another artefactual source of cross-study variability in correlations. If, for example, CSP disclosure measures were plagued by comparatively low psychometric quality (for example, Abbott and Monsen 1979; Ingram and Frazier 1980; Wiseman 1982), observed correlations between CSP disclosures and CFP would be systematically lower than the correlations between CFP and other, more reliable measures of CSP. Therefore, this meta-analysis hierarchically breaks down the overall data set in order to compare the relative magnitudes of correlations arising from different CSP and CFP measurement subcategories, and to test for these three possible sources of cross-study variation of correlations (substantive differences, sampling error, and measurement error). We hypothesize that:

# H4a:

A large proportion of cross-study variance is due to statistical or methodological artefacts (sampling error and measurement error).

# H4b:

Consistent with stakeholder mismatching, after accounting for statistical artefacts, there will still be differences in the statistical associations between different sub-dimensions of CFP and CSP (after correct matching).

# Methods

Prior summaries of the CSP–CFP literature have relied mostly on narrative reviews (for example, Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985) or the vote-counting method of aggregation (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995). Narrative reviews are literature reviews that attempt to make sense of past findings verbally or conceptually. The vote-counting method refers to the cumulation of significance levels or, in the simplest case, to the tabulation of significant and non-significant findings (Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Light and Smith 1971). Both of these research integration techniques tend to draw false inferences because they do not correct for sampling and measurement error, two important study artefacts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In fact, the statistical errors in the typical ‘vote-counting’ literature review tend to be more serious than in the average narrative review because the statistical power of the vote-counting procedure decreases with increasing.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

number of studies reviewed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Although we have known for more than 20 years that vote counting is marred by a lack of validity, the technique is still widely used today (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995).

In contrast, effect-size (r) meta-analysis is a rigorous approach to external validation, which calculates population parameter estimates (ρ) by correcting for the aforementioned artefacts. The effect of sampling error is important because sample sizes that are smaller than the population cause observed sample correlation statistics r to vary randomly from the population parameter, the true-score correlation ρ. In addition, as mentioned before, measurement error (that is, unreliability) systematically attenuates observed correlations (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994).

# Search for Relevant Studies

Computer searches of ABI/Inform Global and PsycINFO were conducted, using the keyword search ‘organizational effectiveness and corporate social performance’. Synonyms for the former, used in separate computer searches, were ‘organizational performance’, ‘profitability’, ‘economic success’, and ‘financial performance’. ‘Corporate social performance’ as a keyword search term was alternately substituted with ‘(corporate) social responsibility’, ‘corporate environmental performance’, ‘responsiveness’, and simply ‘resp?’. ABI/Inform Global gives access to the full text and images of more than 1,200 US and international business and trade journal articles (1970-current), while PsycINFO indexes abstracts of journal articles and book chapters in psychology starting in 1974. To increase the scope of our search, cross-citations from previous narrative reviews (for example, Aldag and Bartol 1978; McGuire et al. 1988: 857 –860; Preston 1978a; Waddock and Mahon 1991; Wood and Jones 1995) were explored as well.

# Criteria for Relevance

The studies that were deemed relevant for the meta-analysis had the following characteristics. First, the studies quantitatively examined the relationship between CSP and CFP. The reported effect size did not have to be a Pearsons’ product-moment correlation r, but could also be a t-test statistic or effect size t d (both t and d can be transformed to r; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Second, the studies were concerned with at least one aspect of a firm’s economic performance, as circumscribed by the definition of CFP. For the purpose of this study, CFP was defined as a company’s financial viability, or the extent to which a company achieves its economic goals (Price and Mueller 1986; Venkatraman and Ramanujam 1986). Third, all retrieved studies were double-checked for conformance to Wood’s (1991a) definition of CSP (see Introduction above). Wood’s (1991a) now classic definition is used because it is one of the most influential, helpful, parsimonious, and yet comprehensive conceptualizations of CSP. If the particular variable could not be classified.

# Organization Studies

# 24(3)

as an example belonging to one of the nine subcategories of Wood’s model, the study was excluded. In addition, unclear reporting of empirical results was also a reason for exclusion.

Studies of environmental management and CFP are included in the meta-analysis for several reasons. First, several studies, especially earlier ones, use environmental performance as a proxy for social responsibility. Second, stakeholder proxies, such as environmental interest groups and government agencies, may in fact give voice to, or claim a social ‘stake’ for, non-human nature (Starik 1995). Lastly, the business community tends to regard social responsibility as including both social and environmental performance (for example, Willums 1999). Still, the argument can be made that the literature on CSP differs from the one on corporate environmental performance in various aspects. To investigate differences between social and environmental performance, the entire set (k = number of effect sizes integrated = 388) is disaggregated into purely social performance measures only (that is, excluding all environmental performance measures; k = 249) and environmental measures only (k = 139).

# Characteristics of Primary Studies

The most important study characteristics, such as author(s), date of study, study sample size N i, observed r or transformed and/or partially corrected r (that is, corrected for dichotomization and unequal sample sizes in the two groups compared in a t-test), number of correlations per study, operationalization of CSP and CFP, and estimates of reliability are listed in Appendix A.

Reliability is traditionally defined as the ratio of true-score variance to observed-score variance (Traub 1994). Thus, classical measurement theory is concerned with the correspondence between observed scores and true scores. Some of the reliability coefficients used in this study are in the tradition of classical reliability theory, such as coefficient alpha. Sometimes, however, it becomes necessary to count not only variation due to item sampling, but also day-to-day variation in scores as measurement error. In classical theory, one can accomplish this task by using an alternate-forms coefficient of reliability. Generalizability theory is less restrictive in its assumptions than classical theory (Cronbach et al. 1972). The coefficient of generalizability reflects the degree to which observed scores (of CSP or CFP in this case) allow for generalization about a firm’s behaviour in a defined universe of situations (Cronbach et al. 1972; Shavelson et al. 1989). Generalizability is estimated through ‘alternate-forms’ correlations between different CSP, and CFP, measures.

The present study estimates reliability by including coefficients of generalizability (76 percent), stability (4 percent), internal reliability (8 percent), and inter-rater reliability (12 percent). Both stability and generalizability coefficients are underestimates of reliability (Orlitzky 1998). Because of the predominance of coefficients of stability and generalizability, the meta-analysis provides conservative estimates (that is, lower-bound estimates) of the reliability of the CSP or CFP measurement instrument.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

In addition to listing the reliabilities of both constructs, Appendix A shows the great variety of study contexts and operationalizations of both constructs. From the vantage point of generating cumulative knowledge, multiple operationism is an advantage because it helps determine whether a ‘true’ relationship exists in different industry contexts with different operationalizations of the two focal constructs (Cook and Campbell 1979; Cooper 1989; Webb et al. 1981). In past meta-analyses, integrated studies often contained broad meta-constructs as well, such as job or organizational performance, operationalized in many different ways (for example, Gooding and Wagner 1985; Ketchen et al. 1997; Roth et al. 1996; Wagner and Gooding 1987). During data collection, the inclusion criteria for relevance (see above) served as constant checks on the operationalizations’ conformance to the broad conceptual definitions of CSP and CFP.

Empirically, the standard deviation of ρ serves as an indicator of cross-study heterogeneity. The percentage of cross-study variance explained by artefacts is another indicator of the degree of cross-study generalizability (Hunter and Schmidt 1990).

# Statistical Conventions Used in the Meta-analysis

The meta-analysis uses Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) statistical aggregation techniques for cumulating correlations and correcting for various study artefacts in order to estimate the true score correlation (ρ) between CSP and CFP. Meta-analysis arrives at a mean true-score correlation by correcting observed correlations for sampling error (which can be written as σe = (1−ρ2) / (N−1)) and for measurement error. Since sampling error varies directly with sample size, all studies are weighted by sample size Ni before correcting for the average attenuation factor (Schmidt and Hunter 1977).

Because measurement error data points are not always available for individual studies (see Appendix A), study correlations cannot be corrected individually for measurement error. Instead, correlations are meta-analysed using artefact distributions (for more details on artefact-distribution meta-analysis, see Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The moderator analyses use Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) subgrouping algorithm, as described in the Results section below.

Non-independence in any meta-analytic data set can present certain problems. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted by using two other aggregation techniques. In the first sensitivity analysis, we used only one independent correlation per study, that is, composite scores. Furthermore, a second sensitivity analysis tested the stability of our transformations of effect sizes (reported t or d statistics into r).

observations is .18, with an observed variance of .06. The study artefacts of sampling and measurement error in CSP and CFP explain 24 percent of the cross-study variance of robs. After correction for sampling and measurement errors, the true score (corrected) correlation (ρ) was .36, which is twice the size of the observed correlation, with a variance (.19), which is slightly more than three times the size of the observed variance. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the relationship remains positive even after we removed studies that may be affected by response bias (survey measures of CFP) and halo (CSP reputation indices; Brown and Perry 1994); the remaining meta-analytic set showed an average observed correlation of .08 and a true-score correlation of .15. Although this true-score correlation is smaller than in the larger set including CSP reputation and CFP survey measures, it is not trivial. Thus, the meta-analytic findings support hypothesis H1.

The sensitivity analyses tend to confirm this conclusion. The first sensitivity analysis, which uses only one effect size per study (thus, k = 52, N = 4924), showed a mean observed correlation of .21 and a corrected correlation of .42. The second sensitivity analysis, on 210 product-moment correlations (k) with a total sample size of 22,218 observations (N), also showed slightly higher estimates (robs = .20, ρ = .41) than the overall meta-analysis reported in Table 1. Thus, in both ‘sensitivity’ meta-analyses (not reported in the tables), the mean observed and corrected correlations were positive and of similar magnitude as the correlations in the entire meta-analytic set. If anything, the sensitivity analyses suggest that our meta-analytic estimates are actually conservative estimates of the relationships between CSP and CFP.

# Corporate Social and Environmental Performance

Table 1 also shows analyses for two different conceptualizations of CSP. When the entire meta-analytic set was divided into two sets, that is, (a) those studies using a narrow definition of ‘social’ performance (thus excluding measures of environmental performance; k = 249, N = 24,055) and (b) studies of corporate environmental performance only (k = 139, N = 9823), the findings show that corporate environmental performance has a smaller relationship with CFP (robs = .06, ρ = .12) than do all other measures of CSP (robs = .23, ρ = .47), such as managerial principles and corporate reputations for minority hiring, for example. In the corporate environmental performance subset, the variances of observed and true-score correlations were also smaller than those in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Furthermore, measurement error and sampling error explained more of the cross-study variance of robs in the corporate environmental performance subset than in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Thus, the last two lines of Table 1 (entries 3.a and 3.b) demonstrate that the relatively lower correlation between corporate environmental performance and CFP is, in fact, much more consistent across industry and study contexts than the primary empirical studies would have us believe.

bias. Availability bias is one of the most common criticisms levelled against meta-analysis, in that critics of meta-analysis often suspect that published studies will report larger effect sizes than unpublished studies. File drawer analysis addresses this issue by computing the number of additional unlocated (that is, ‘lost’ or overlooked) studies needed to cause the correlation to decrease to a minimal critical level (r crit), which is set at .05 in this study. Hunter and Schmidt (1990) present the underlying assumptions and techniques of file drawer analysis. For each correlation computed in Tables 1–4, the results of the file drawer analysis are presented in the last column. As shown in Table 1, a very large number of studies (1,037) would be needed to change the overall substantive conclusions of this meta-analysis (entry 1 in Table 1).

# Temporal Sequence

Tables 2a and 2b show the results relevant to Hypothesis 2, which suggested a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP. Consistent with that hypothesis, the primary studies supported the instrumental stakeholder and slack resources theories to about the same degree. Specifically, both the prior CFP and subsequent CFP subsets yielded observed correlations of .15, and corrected correlations of .29 (first two lines in Table 2a). Concurrent studies yielded observed and corrected correlations with CFP of .22 and .44, respectively (third line of Table 2a). Taken together, these findings suggest a virtuous cycle with quick cycle times or concurrent bidirectionality. However, the low percentages of observed cross-study variance explained by artefacts, ranging from 20 percent to 26 percent, and large true-score variances ranging from .17 to .19, indicate the presence of at least one moderator. As Table 2b shows, consistent with the overall analysis (Table 1, entries 3.a and 3.b), the results are stronger after corporate environmental measures were removed from CSP. Generally, though, the relationships reported in Table 2b confirm the conclusions of Table 2a.

# Mediator Variables: Learning and Reputation

To investigate Hypothesis 3, studies were divided into two broad subsets: (a) studies that correlated both internal and external measures of CSP with only accounting CFP measures (that is, measures of internal resource utilization, such as ROA or ROE); and (b) studies which correlated only externally visible measures of CSP, such as CSP reputation or disclosures, with exclusively external (for example, market return or sales growth) measures of CFP. The reputational argument is further subdivided into studies correlating external indicators of CFP with: (a) reputation indices of CSP; (b) CSP disclosures in annual reports and letters to shareholders; and (c) other externally visible measures of CSP such as social audits and charitable contributions.

Based on the magnitude of the meta-analytic correlations, the meta-analysed studies support the reputation-effects viewpoint relatively more strongly than the internal viewpoint, as shown in Table 3 (compare first two).

lines in Table 3, that is, entry 1 with entry 2). In addition, further hierarchical breakdown of the reputation view subset indicates that CSP disclosures appear to have a low reputational impact on CFP. This statistical conclusion is generalizable across study settings because a high proportion of variance (93 percent) is explained by study artefacts (entry 2.b in Table 3). Moreover, timing of measurement (temporal sequence) is not an important moderator within the ‘reputation view’ argument. As was the case in the overall meta-analysis, the correlations between CSP and subsequent CFP are almost identical to the ones found between CSP and prior CFP (ρ = .75 and .73, respectively; entries 2.a.1 and 2.a.2 in Table 3). Again, the correlations are highest when CSP and CFP were measured less than a year apart (ρ = .91, and 51 percent of cross-study variance explained by artefacts; entry 2.a.3).

# Moderator Analysis

The analyses relevant to Hypothesis 3 already alluded to an important feature of Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) meta-analytic technique; namely, detection of cross-study moderators. Because this algorithm will be used extensively in the remaining meta-analyses, a brief explanation seems in order. Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) moderator analysis consists of two distinct methods. First, the ‘75% rule’ can be applied, stating that if 75 percent or more of the observed variance of correlations across studies is due to artefacts, then probably all of it is artefactual variance (on the grounds that the remaining 25 percent is likely due to artefacts not corrected for). Thus, in cases where 75 percent or more of the variance is explained by artefacts, including sampling error variance, moderators are unlikely to have caused a real variation in observed correlations (robs). This first method is able to detect the existence of unsuspected moderators.

The second method, which can detect discontinuous, theoretically predicted moderators, compares mean observed and true-score correlations across study domain subsets of the original entire set of studies aggregated in the meta-analysis. If in these meta-analytic subgroups, a higher percentage of variance is accounted for by study artefacts relative to the entire meta-analytic set, moderators are said to exist.

# Measurement Strategy as Moderator

To examine Hypotheses 4a and 4b, the entire data set of 388 correlations was broken down hierarchically to investigate the presence of moderator effects based on the operationalizations of CSP and CFP (see Table 4a). First, CFP and CSP operationalizations were disaggregated separately. Second, the four broad CSP operationalization subsets were broken down hierarchically into the two (or three, where available) CFP measurement categories. The lowest level in Table 4a is the only one that is not confounded by lack of standardized measurement and, thus, is the most informative.

In general, Table 4a indicates that the association between CSP and CFP depends on the firm’s or researcher’s operational definition of each construct, or both. Accounting measures were more highly correlated with CSP than.

Market-based measures (ρ = .42 as against .15; entries 1.b versus 1.a in Table 4a), and were particularly highly correlated with CSP reputation indices (ρ = .61; entry 2.b.2). In fact, overall the findings with respect to CSP operationalizations suggest that studies that used reputation indices as proxies for CSP showed the highest average correlation with CFP (ρ of .73 with a large variance of .19; entry 2.b in Table 4a). Of course, this high correlation may partially be due to halo (Brown and Perry 1994).

Furthermore, repeating the pattern of results testing reputation-theory effects (Table 3), disclosure measures appear to be only minimally related to CFP (robs = .04, ρ = .09, as shown in entry 2.a). This finding is generalizable because almost all the observed variance is explained by artefacts. Social audits, CSP processes, and outcomes are only modestly correlated with CFP (robs = .09, ρ = .18; entry 2.c). Similar mean correlations were found for the relationship between corporate social responsibility values or attitudes and CFP (robs = .10, ρ = .21; entry 2.d). The second level in the hierarchical breakdown supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study artefacts, stakeholder mismatching, other theoretical mis-specifications, or lack of theory (cf. also McWilliams and Siegel 2000). As discussed above, the overall percentage of cross-study variance (in robs) explained is 24 percent. In general, this percentage tends to increase in the measurement subgroups listed in Table 4a, which suggests that studies systematically differ with respect to the distortions caused by (previously uncorrected) statistical and methodological artefacts. The fact that artefacts account for 15 –100 percent of cross-study variance (the notorious ‘inconsistencies’ of this research stream) provides support for Hypothesis 4a.

The support for theoretical inconsistencies (stakeholder mismatching) becomes apparent by looking at some second-level hierarchical subgroups. First, the correlation of CSP disclosure measures with accounting CFP measures is slightly negative (ρ = –.02; entry 2.a.2). This small correlation supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis because there is no theoretical causal mechanism between CSP disclosures and internal (that is, accounting) CFP measures. Second, the observed and corrected correlations between (a) social audit and other observable or ‘objective’ (for example, dollar amount of charitable contributions) measures of CSP processes and (b) market-based measures of CFP are close to zero (Table 4a, entry 2.c.1), which again supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis. As Wood and Jones (1995: 242) argued earlier, ‘There is no theory to explain why stockholders would or would not prefer a company that gives one percent of pre-tax earnings to charity, that hires and develops minority or women workers, or that ranks higher in pollution control indices.’ In other words, the data suggest that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioural measures of CSP (such as charitable donations), perhaps because they are perceived as direct attempts by firms to manage external impressions.

To examine the measurement moderators within subgroup 2.c even more closely, Table 4b shows results for social audits disaggregated from other CSP behaviours, which are further broken down.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

worthy. First, social audits were consistently, but only modestly, correlated with CFP (ρ = .23, 100 percent of cross-study variance explained). Second, across industry contexts, philanthropic donations were related with CFP at ρ = .29, which was higher than the respective correlation coefficients found for all other measures of CSP behaviours. However, the file drawer analyses (last column of Table 4b) suggest that some of the findings presented in Table 4b are not conclusive because a small number of additional studies could change our conclusions.

# Discussion

# Theoretical Implications

Based on this meta-analysis integrating 30 years of research, the answer to the introductory question posed by Business Week is affirmative. The results of this meta-analysis show that there is a positive association between CSP and CFP across industries and across study contexts. In that sense, we can confirm Frooman’s (1997) conclusions, based on event studies, supporting the validity of enlightened self-interest in the social responsibility arena. The data accumulated over the past 30 years do not support the latest contingency theory in the area of corporate social responsibility (McWilliams and Siegel 2001). Like earlier research reviews, McWilliams and Siegel (2001) take inconsistent findings in primary studies at face value (that is, ignore the possible impact of sampling error and measurement error) and explain the (apparent) inconsistency with a demand/supply model of corporate social responsibility. Moreover, the temporal analysis of our meta-analysis shows that the positive association between CFP and lagged CSP (slack resources argument) does not mask a weaker negative association between CSP and lagged CFP.

Can CSP be motivated by an ‘ecological selection process based on profit maximization or organizational survival’ (Wholey and Brittain 1986, in Husted 2000: 33)? Husted (2000: 34) agrees with the narrative reviews in this area, stating that it is ‘premature’ to conclude that adaptation to market and non-market environments might force organizations to consider social issues and CSP in their day-to-day strategizing. Our meta-analysis suggests the opposite. In fact, some of our observed correlations are higher than the correlations typically found between strategy-structure fit and CFP (Amburgey and Dacin 1994; Donaldson 1987). Despite those lower correlations, the strategy-structure-performance paradigm is firmly grounded on an economic survival mechanism (across industry contexts) analogous to Hypothesis 1. On the one hand, our meta-analysis contradicts Rowley and Berman’s (2000) suggestion that there cannot be a consistently positive relationship between CSP and CFP. On the other hand, in agreement with Rowley and Berman (2000), we demonstrate that the universally positive relationship varies (from highly positive to modestly positive) because of contingencies, such as reputation effects, market measures of CFP, or CSP disclosures.

Traditionally, researchers have worried that any positive correlations are artefactual, due to halo effects (Brown and Perry 1994, 1995; Wood 1995). However, it is important to keep in mind that the only credible halo linkage would be from CFP to CSP; that is, companies that perform better financially receive higher CSP ratings, regardless of their true underlying CSP. The meta-analytic breakdown has shown that the potential halo effect (CFP → lagged CSP correlation) does not dominate a weaker CSP → lagged CFP correlation and distort results. In fact, the two correlations are identical at two digits (.29, see Table 2a). Also, when all potentially problematic studies are removed (that is, those that measure CSP reputations only and those that measure CFP with a survey instrument), the meta-analysis still shows a non-trivial positive ‘true-score’ correlation of .15 (see Table 1). Furthermore, the halo argument would suggest a much higher correlation between external (market) CFP and CSP reputation than between internal (accounting) CFP and CSP reputation. In fact, however, the correlations in both subgroups were similar (entries 2.b.1 versus 2.b.2 in Table 4a).

When the CFP survey measures and CSP reputation measures are removed, the cross-study variation of robs can be shown to be increasingly a function of the artefacts of sampling and measurement error (44 percent; see entry 2 in Table 1). Thus, many of the negative findings in individual studies are artefactual, so that the generalization of a positive CSP –CFP relationship applies more broadly than previously suggested (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995). We can, therefore, state with some confidence that the association between CSP and lagged CFP is not negative. Moreover, the causation seems to be that CSP and CFP mutually affect each other through a virtuous cycle: financially successful companies spend more because they can afford it, but CSP also helps them become a bit more successful. Moreover, the le drawer analysis indicates that the present findings cannot be dismissed by availability bias.

This meta-analysis both rejects and confirms notions developed by neo-classical economists. On the one hand, it rejects the idea that CSP is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization (Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958). Instead, organizational effectiveness may be a broad concept encompassing both financial and social performance (Andrews 1987; Judge 1994). It is also worth noting that, according to most credible versions of stakeholder theory, shareholders are legitimate stakeholders. On the other hand, our findings also confirm the notions of libertarians such as Friedman that government regulation in the area of CSP may not be necessary. If the statistical relationship between CSP and CFP were negative, bottom-line considerations might constitute barriers to outcomes desired by the public, which in turn would make government intervention, which serves the public ‘interest’, a necessity. Yet, with CSP, the case for regulation and social control by governments (acting on behalf of ‘society’ or ‘the public’) is relatively weak because organizations and their shareholders tend to benefit from managers’ prudent analysis, evaluation, and balancing of multiple constituents’ preferences. Therefore, these actions are most likely adopted.

voluntarily, based on managers’ cost-benefit analyses of a firm’s investments. In contrast, ‘socially responsible’ command-and-control regulation may prescribe inflexible means–ends chains that are inappropriate for a particular firm’s non-market and market environments (Majumdar and Marcus 2001).

# Implications for Future Research

The meta-analysis helps to identify areas in which there have been relatively few studies conducted, and which warrant more research (for example, social responsibility values and market CFP; see Table 4a). Additionally, the analysis shows areas in which the unexplained variance across studies remains relatively large, so that further inquiry is needed to identify moderators (for example, CSP reputation measures and market-based CFP; see Table 4a).

Moreover, Appendix A shows that the field must make a concerted effort to improve the reliability of CSP and CFP measures. In several subgroups, the percentage of variance of r obs explained by measurement error (that is, low reliability) was substantial. In addition to psychometric refinements, CSP researchers must decide whether CSP ‘processes’ should really be regarded as a social performance measure. Including processes is equivalent to acknowledging effort. More broadly, some readers may share the authors’ concern that previous studies were over-inclusive with respect to definitions of stakeholders and, thus, the CSP proxies (cf. also Roman et al. 1999). We would argue that in future studies, only social and environmental performance ‘outcomes’ should count as CSP and that the concept of ‘stakeholder’ must be more restrictive than it currently is.

Another concern that may be raised concerns the different variable CSP measures. This issue needs to be examined in future theoretical and empirical work. We believe that CSP, like CFP, is a valid theoretical construct — admittedly a meta-construct — which can be measured in a variety of ways. Like Meyer and Gupta (1994), we see the possible independence of the operationalizations as a natural outcome of differences in organizational strategies, structures, and environments. Moreover, we share the view of many meta-analysts (for example, Cooper 1989; Dalton et al. 1999; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Smith and Glass 1977) that broad constructs can, and should, be operationalized in a number of ways. As long as researchers’ choices of CSP (and CFP) measures are informed by prior judgments of their theoretical meaningfulness and subjected to peer review, then relatively low correlations across measurement categories do not present an obstacle to research integration. More important to the present case, however, is that our review of CSP generalizability coefficients shows that different CSP measures are, in fact, rather highly correlated (average rxx = .71; Appendix A). In other words, conceptual speculations about the impossibility of meaningful integration of prior research are not supported by empirical evidence (for a detailed review of this topic, cf. Orlitzky 1998).

Overall, we reach very different conclusions than Margolis and Walsh (2001). Although we agree with some of their more definitive conclusions as to a positive CSP–CFP relationship, we also argue that our data analysis.

shows that interesting questions remain. The research effort does not have to be abandoned because of poor theory or poor methods in this line of inquiry. We are particularly concerned with the conclusions of Margolis and Walsh (2001) because their criticism of other studies is argued from the vantage point of a method (the ‘vote-counting’ literature review) whose lack of validity has been known for more than 20 years (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). First, they do not take into account sampling and measurement errors. Moreover, their review relies on a binary world-view, which holds that a relationship between CSP and CFP either exists (if results are statistically positive, or negative) or does not exist (if results are mixed or statistically non-significant, which they falsely call ‘zero’ effects (cf. Cohen 1990, 1994)). The relationship between business and society is too important theoretically to base our conclusions on methodologically ill-advised research reviews.

# Implications for Managers

Despite previous assumptions of inconclusive findings (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995), we can legitimately derive implications for corporate strategy from the meta-analysis. First and foremost, market forces generally do not penalize companies that are high in corporate social performance; thus, managers can afford to be socially responsible. If managers believe that CSP is an antecedent of CFP, they may eventually actively pursue CSP because they think the market will reward them for doing so. Top managers must learn to use CSP as a reputational lever (ρ= .73) and be attentive to the perceptions of third parties, regardless of whether they are market analysts, public interest groups, or the media. Whereas social audits in and of themselves are only moderately beneficial (ρ = .23), a company that is high in CSP may especially benefit from receiving public endorsement from federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As Fombrun (1996) suggested, the key to reaping benefits from CSP is a return from reputation (cf. also Roberts and Dowling 2002).

As findings about the positive relationships between CSP and CFP become more widely known, managers may be more likely to pursue CSP as part of their strategy for attaining high CFP. These strategic management considerations would be consistent with Baron’s (2000) managerial approach to the business–society interface. Baron (2000) argues that successful executives are able to integrate market strategies with non-market strategies in order to position their firm for optimal effectiveness. Baron’s (2000) book offers guidelines as to how firms can strategically achieve this integration in a number of areas (such as the news media, activists, social movements, legislatures, ethics, and so on). Alternatively, social performance may increase through less deliberate decision processes, as firms emulate others that are experiencing high financial success (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Either evolutionary process would reduce the importance of coercive control.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

mechanisms (in the form of government regulations) for effecting public welfare and ecological sustainability. If the mental models of managers and regulators moved to this more libertarian framework, the primary role of regulations would be their signalling function with respect to prioritizing certain issues and certain constituents’ claims over others.

# Conclusion

Theoretically, portraying managers’ choices with respect to CSP and CFP as an either/or trade-off is not justified in light of 30 years of empirical data. This meta-analysis has shown that (1) across studies, CSP is positively correlated with CFP, (2) the relationship tends to be bidirectional and simultaneous, (3) reputation appears to be an important mediator of the relationship, and (4) stakeholder mismatching, sampling error, and measurement error can explain between 15 percent and 100 percent of the cross-study variation in various subsets of CSP–CFP correlations. Corporate virtue in the form of social and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is rewarding in more ways than one.

# Corporate Sustainability in Bangladeshi Banks: Proactive or Reactive Ethical Behavior?

# Abstract

The purpose of this study is to analyze the connection between the sustainability performance and financial performance of Bangladeshi banks to explore the impact of the Bangladesh Environmental Risk Management Guideline. We analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are currently operating in Bangladesh under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample has been collected from publicly available reports such as annual, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, and data published from the Central Bank. Data has been analyzed using panel regression. Our results indicate that higher sustainability performance creates a higher financial performance, and that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks. The analysis did not find, however, that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Consequently, this research contributes to the research on legitimacy-driven behavior of Bangladeshi banks. This behavior rather leads to a reactive adoption of sustainability activities instead of proactive behavior.

# 1. Introduction

Recently, there has been an increasing number of calls for a more sustainable financial industry [1] that even motivated the Financial Stability Board of the G20 to establish a Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure [2]. With the economic rise of many Asian countries, integrating sustainable finance into the financial industry of these countries is important to address environmental and social issues, such as environmental pollution [3] and inequality [4]. To address both organizational ethics and financial sector stability, several countries, among them China and Bangladesh, introduced financial industry sustainability policies in addition to voluntary codes of conduct implemented by the industry. These countries experience severe environmental issues, such as air and water pollution, that have significant effects on their population and therefore try to decrease lending to and investing in polluting industries as well as to increase financing of more environmentally friendly industries. Bangladesh Bank, for instance, introduced the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines (ERM) in 2011 [5] to engage the financial sector in green finance.

As financial sector sustainability regulations are relatively new, there is a lack of research about the effect of these policies on both the financial and the sustainability performance of the regulated industries. Furthermore, there is a gap in the knowledge about the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of banks in countries with such policies. Most of the studies published so far address the Chinese Green Credit Policy [6–10]. Those studies found a positive effect of green banking activities, such as green lending and the financial performance of the financial sector.

institutions. Studies addressing a South Asian country such as Bangladesh are sparse, and their results are controversial. However, they agree that sustainable banking, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting, is in an early phase in Bangladesh [11–15].

Though ERM has been introduced in 2011, only a few banks in Bangladesh even adopted green banking guidelines at this time [16]. However, Ahmed and Ahmed [17], for instance, found that the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks has increased since then. Nevertheless, they did not find a correlation between their environmental and financial performance. Other studies that addressed the lending business, however, found that integrating sustainability criteria into the lending business decreases the number of default loans and consequently has a positive impact on a lender’s financial performance [18]. Despite some research on sustainability in Bangladeshi banks, the question remains whether regulatory sustainability guidelines improve both the environmental and financial performance of the regulated banks.

We use legitimacy theory [19, 20] to explain why and how Bangladeshi banks adopt sustainability strategies and what the consequences are for their financial performance. The theory states that banks will adopt environmental regulations and increase their sustainability performance if there is outside pressure. Furthermore, the theory claims that external pressure is stronger for bigger banks than smaller banks. Finally, according to the theory, adopting guidelines because of legitimacy concerns will not lead to integration into the banks’ strategies. Consequently, our three research questions are whether higher sustainability performance increases financial performance, whether better financial performance leads to higher sustainability performance, and whether bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

To respond to the research questions, we analyzed all 56 regulated Bangladeshi banks between 2012 and 2016 based on their annual reports, CSR, or similar reports and on the information from their websites. In line with a study that addressed a similar question in China [8], an indicator system that consists of social and environmental sustainability indicators has been used to calculate a sustainability score (SS) for the banks. The score has been used as the independent variable to predict the financial performance of the banks as well as the dependent variable based on a lagged panel regression and Granger causality calculation [21].

The results of the study demonstrate that higher sustainability performance creates higher financial performance. However, the analysis did not find that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Finally, we could show that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

Following legitimacy theory, we conclude that the analyzed banks are rather reactive concerning their sustainability strategy and that they mainly respond to the institutional pressure of Bangladesh Bank because of legitimacy purposes. Instead of integrating sustainability aspects into their core business to decrease risks and to increase the opportunities of green banking, and consequently increase their financial performance, banks rather react in a stakeholder-oriented fashion to keep their legitimacy. Consistent with legitimacy theory, they are biased towards activities favorable to stakeholders instead of a strategic sustainability approach.

The study contributes to legitimacy theory in sustainable banking and its financial consequences. It demonstrates that increased sustainability performance has a positive effect on the financial performance of banks, as intended by Bangladesh Bank’s ERM, but that this information is not integrated into the banks’ business strategies. Furthermore, the research contributes to legitimacy theory by adding knowledge about the legitimacy-driven behavior of South Asian banks. Moreover, our results contribute to theory by suggesting that legitimacy-driven behavior might not lead to strategic corporate sustainability that addresses the main societal issues in a proactive way.

The remainder of the paper describes the background literature and the theory, followed by the presentation of the sample and methods. Finally, we report the results of the study and finish with a discussion and conclusions.

# 2. Background

Several studies have analyzed financial sustainability regulations and their impact on regulated banks. Most of these studies explore the impact of the Chinese Green Credit Guidelines. Some studies, however, also examine Bangladeshi banks with regard to their sustainability. In general, however, studies on this topic in South Asia are sparse. The following sections present an overview of empirical findings on banks and sustainability, financial sector sustainability regulations and policies, as well as theoretical findings on financial sector sustainability regulations and sustainability in banking.

Banks started integrating non-financial environmental and social aspects into their business during the 1980s. Firstly, they addressed internal environmental management [22], resulting in water, energy, and materials savings, as well as in lower emissions and high reputation [23]. As the second step, banks integrated environmental issues into lending, investing, asset management, and project finance [24]. Hence, they became CSR intermediaries [25] that influence the CSR of their clients, because higher corporate social performance (CSP) mitigates borrowers’ financial risks [26]. Consequently, voluntary sustainability codes of conduct, such as the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative (UNEPFI), the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (UNPRI), and the Equator Principles have been instigated [27].

Sustainability risks, such as those caused by climate change or negative environmental impacts of commercial borrowers or investees, have a significant influence on the financial risk of credit and investment portfolios. Consequently, they have to be managed thoroughly [7, 28]. Therefore, many banks have implemented sustainable credit risk assessment procedures [29] and have been using environmental, social, and governance criteria to conduct responsible investments [30 – 32]. Some studies, however, suggest that the sustainability strategies of many banks are not substantially addressing their core business and the main societal issues [33].

For a long time, the pressure on the financial sector to perform well concerning the sustainability impact of their main products and services, such as lending and investing, has been lower than in many other industries (Weber et al., 2014). Studies have found, however, that environmental and sustainability reporting positively correlates with the size and the profitability of financial institutions [14, 34, 35]. Furthermore, the integration of environmental and sustainability issues into financial sector products and services has been increasing over time and has positive effects on the banks’ financial performance (Scholtens, 2008a).

Consequently, one of the motivations for integrating sustainability into the banking business is the correlation with the financial performance of banks. Igbudu and Garanti [36] suggest that sustainable banking increases the banks’ loyalty and corporate reputation, while a study in Germany identified a strong growth potential for social banking [37] and, therefore, a new market to tap into. Furthermore, studies found a positive connection between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in the banking sector [38, 39], between sustainability, measured by the membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and efficiency [40], as well as between responsible investing and financial returns [41, 42]. However, Climent [43] found that ethical banks are less profitable than their conventional counterparts but that they have more substantial growth in their lending business.

Additionally, several studies suggest that banks are rather reactive and defensive concerning the incorporation of sustainability aspects into their core businesses [44, 45]. Many of them focus on short-term results and do not integrate sustainability into their core business [46]. The need for a sustainability culture [47] to develop capabilities and to provide resources to improve corporate sustainability performance, however, is not only a phenomenon in the financial industry but in all sectors [48 – 51]. Consequently, financial sector sustainability regulations should take into account that banks might not have the necessary capabilities and resources to implement the regulations efficiently in a way that increases their financial performance.

Though heavily regulated compared with other industrial sectors, the financial sector’s exposure to institutional pressure and regulations addressing sustainability [52], environmental, and societal risks [53, 54] is relatively small. Financial sector regulations focus mainly on risk-adjusted.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

financial capital provisions, financial risks, and guaranteeing the stability of the financial industry. Newer approaches, however, also address the impact of the financial sector on sustainable development and risks for the stability of the financial industry caused by sustainability risks, such as climate change [55]. Mainly, regulations and policies addressing the impact of climate change on the financial sector are discussed, for instance, by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures [56], but also in academia [57].

Financial sector sustainability regulations are implemented mainly for two reasons: (1) to increase green lending and investment and (2) to enhance the financial sector’s financial stability [7, 18, 58]. The financial sector sustainability regulation that is most frequently discussed in academic publications is the Chinese Green Credit Policy, introduced by the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012 [6]. Whether the Chinese regulation has achieved its goals is controversial. Zhao and Xu [59] state that the Green Credit Policy will increase green lending and consequently contribute to sustainable development. Additionally, studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of Chinese banks found that banks with a higher green lending ratio and higher sustainability performance are exposed to lower risks [7–9]. Jiguang and Zhiqun [60] are more critical and claim that additional regulations and internationalization is needed to promote green finance, particularly carbon finance. Similarly, another study asks for better implementation mechanisms to guarantee the success of the green credit policy [10]. A study that addresses financial industry sustainability regulations in South America from a macro perspective, however, found a positive effect of these regulations on the financial stability of the financial industry [58].

The need to increase capabilities to become more sustainable, even in the presence of regulations, is emphasized by two studies. They suggest that environmental risk management practices have to be improved to avoid a trade-off between the sustainability performance of banks and their financial performance [61, 62].

A study that addresses the implementation problem in Bangladesh came to a similar conclusion. Though there is a potential for sustainable banking to have positive effects on banks’ financial performance, the necessary capabilities for sustainable banking, such as sustainable credit rating expertise and systems, are often missing [18]. Additionally, a study analyzing the situation in India suggests that the public sector banking industry addresses sustainability in a defensive and preventive way. The research indicates that banks adopt the regulatory norms but are not pro-active in addressing sustainable development in their business [45].

Positive impacts of sustainable banking on sustainable development, however, have been identified in a study analyzing Nigerian banks [63]. Similar to banks in China and Bangladesh, Nigerian banks are regulated through a sustainable banking policy overseen by the domestic banking regulator [55]. Hence, such regulations might change banks toward a direction where they contribute to sustainable development and reduce their financing of unsustainable businesses and projects [64].

Bangladesh Bank introduced the Environmental Risk Management (ERM) Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh in 2011 [5]. Their goal is to incentivize banks to integrate environmental and social criteria into their credit risk management procedures and consequently to improve the environmental and social standards in Bangladesh’s industries. ERM introduced guidelines and tools to improve the sustainability assessment as well as refinancing schemes for environmentally sustainable projects [18]. Consequently, if adopted, the policy should influence the environmental sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks. Several studies assessing the corporate sustainability performance of Bangladesh companies and banks, however, suggest that corporate sustainability and corporate sustainability reporting is on a low level compared to other countries.

One of the earliest studies, as well as newer research on corporate sustainability reporting in Bangladesh, state that both the quantity and the quality of environmental disclosures are poor compared to those in many other countries [34, 65], though many stakeholders in Bangladesh ask for transparent corporate reporting [66]. The reasons for the lack of disclosure are a shortage of resources, the exclusive

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

focus on profit, lack of legal requirements, lack of awareness and capacity, poor sustainability performance, and the fear of bad publicity [67]. Additionally, studies on the sustainability reporting of Bangladeshi banks echo these results [12]. Khan and Islam [13], for instance, found that only a few Bangladeshi banks address all the criteria proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative. For example, only a few banks conduct environmental disclosure [68]. A reason for these results might be low stakeholder pressure, particularly from the general public [15]. Since 2010, however, funds allocated to green banking are increasing in Bangladesh, though the absolute value is still low [11]. Finally, public commercial banks in Bangladesh adopted the ERM guideline and increased their green lending [16] as well as their sustainability activities [69]. To close the gap in the literature about the adoption of green banking regulations in South Asia, the objective of our study is to analyze the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks, the connection between their sustainability performance and financial performance, and the influence of the banks’ size and their sustainability performance.

# 3. Theory

The study is based on legitimacy theory [20]. In line with Suchman, we define legitimacy as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of Bangladeshi banks are appropriate within the norms created by the regulator Bangladesh Bank. Related research found that legitimacy-based sustainability activities of firms are reactions to external pressure [70]. The emphasis here lies on reactive, meaning that corporations do not engage in sustainability activities as a proactive way to increase their business performance but as a reaction to stakeholder pressure or events. Consequently, activities decrease when pressure decreases [71].

Another implication based on legitimacy theory is that bigger institutions are more exposed to public pressure and therefore react more strongly [72]. In our study, we assume that bigger banks are more exposed to the influence of the public, including the regulator. Consequently, they conduct sustainability activities because of self-interest and normative approval [20]. Finally, in line with legitimacy theory, we hypothesize that banks report more about the environment than about social issues because the ERM mainly addresses environmental sustainability.

Sustainability activities triggered by legitimacy concerns, however, are not stable and do not address the core strategies and activities of banks but try to satisfy stakeholders. Therefore, we hypothesize that banks do not increase their sustainability activities even if they were able to improve their financial performance because of their sustainability activities. Hence, they do not follow a strategic corporate sustainability approach [73].

To summarize, our main hypotheses are (1) that Bangladeshi banks are reactive with regard to their sustainability activities, (2) that bigger banks perform a stronger reaction than smaller banks, (3) that Bangladeshi banks mainly focus on the environmental aspect of sustainability, and (4) that the financial success of sustainability activities does not lead to increased activities in the following year.

# 4. Materials and Methods

We analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are operating under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample was collected from publicly available reports, such as annual, sustainability, and CSR reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, as well as data published by the Bangladesh Bank. We conducted a document analysis using NVIVO software. The keywords are in line with similar studies [8,24] and are based on the criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative [74–76].

The sample consists of four types of banks, state-owned commercial banks (SOB), specialized development banks (SDB), private commercial banks (PCB), and foreign commercial banks (FCB) (see Table 1). Data was collected for the years between 2012 and 2016. The year 2016 was the year we found full disclosure for all banks in the sample at the time of gathering the data. The first year is the

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

year of the implementation of the ERM guides. Only 22 out of the 56 banks, however, have published any information related to environmental, social, and sustainability aspects.

Financial data was gathered from the banks’ annual reports. We used total assets (TA), net profit after tax (NPAT), return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE) as key financial accounting indicators. In line with [19], TA was used to measure the size of the banks. The other indicators have been used by similar studies that address the link between sustainability performance and financial performance in the banking sector (see, for instance, [7,8,38,77]).

The analysis of the sustainability performance was conducted in line with earlier studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of banks [8]. It is based on the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative [74]. The analysis assessed the presence of strategies, activities, products, and services in the categories of social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The latter were assessed because they are addressed by the ERM. If an indicator was mentioned, a bank achieved a value 1 for the indicator. Otherwise, it achieved the value 0.

To analyze Granger causality [21], we used panel regression models with one-year lags for sustainability performance and financial performance, respectively. As the Hausman test [78] was significant, we used fixed-effects models. To control for accuracy of the regression, we used bootstrapping [79].

# 5. Results

We start by presenting the major financial and sustainability indicators of the banks in the sample, split by banking types (see Table 2). In line with Bangladesh Bank, we distinguished between conventional commercial banks, foreign commercial banks, Islamic banks, specialized banks, and state-owned commercial banks.

The three categories, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, were tested for homogeneity using Cronbach’s alpha [80]. All three categories achieved a value higher than 0.8, with αsocial = 0.87, αenvironment = 0.87, and αgreen = 0.85. Consequently, based on the disclosure of the indicators, a sustainability score was calculated for each bank. First, we calculated the sum of the values for environmental, social, and green indicators. Then, the banks’ results were divided by the maximum achievable value to standardize the values for the banks’ performance in the respective category. Lastly, a sustainability score (SS) was calculated using the average of the environmental, social, and green scores. As a result, SS is an equally weighted combination of the environmental, social, and green products and services scores. The descriptive statistics of the categories and SS are presented in Table 4.

# Test Statistics

To control for differences between government banks and other banks as well as between domestic banks and international banks, we conducted t-tests with SS as the dependent variable. We found a statistically significant difference between domestic and international banks with regard to their SS performance (df = 278, t = 3.274, p = 0.001). Domestic banks performed better with regard to the sustainability score than international banks (𝑥domestic = 0.435, 𝑥international = 0.338). The t-test for government-owned banks and other banks did not result in a statistically significant difference between these two groups (df = 278, t = −1.097, p = 0.274).

Secondly, we tested the difference between the three categories: social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The results of the Hotelling Test [82] indicate a significant difference between the three categories (T2 = 1871, F = 619.2, p < 0.0001). Environmental sustainability achieves the highest average, with social sustainability as the second-highest category, followed by green products and services (𝑥environment = 0.61, 𝑥social = 0.41, 𝑥green products = 0.24).

As the next step, we analyzed the change in the sustainability performance SS as well as of the three sustainability sub-groups over time, as we assumed that the introduction of the ERM created a change with regard to the banks’ sustainability performance. The change over time is presented in Figure 1, suggesting a slight increase in all three sustainability fields over time.

|2014|0.2|
|2015|0.3|
|2016|0.4|

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

We tested the increase of the sustainability performance over time using an ANOVA for repeated measurement with the year and the banks as factors and the sustainability score as the dependent variable. The results of the ANOVA show that the change of the sustainability score over time is significant (F = 24.86, df = 4, p < 0.0001) and that there is a significant difference in the sustainability score between the banks (F = 12.83, df = 55, p < 0.0001). Additionally, the full model is significant (F = 13.65, df = 59, p < 0.0001) and explains 79 percent of the total variance.

In addition, Figure 1 shows that the development over time is very similar for all three categories. As tested above, the environmental sustainability category has the highest value before social sustainability and green products and services.

As the next step, we conducted a fixed-effects panel regression (see above for the Haussman test indicating fixed effects). The financial indicators and the sustainability score were used as independent and time-lagged dependent variables, respectively, to analyze cause and effect between the sustainability score and the financial performance using Granger causality (see Table 5). To control for accuracy, we used bootstrapping with 50 replications. The results of the one-year time lags are presented in Table 6. Two- and three-year time lags did not suggest different results but are based on fewer data.

| |Sustainability Score|ROE|−0.004|0.099|0.712|
| |ROE|Sustainability Score|2.13|0.20|0.0130|

The results show significant regressions for SS predicting the lagged financial indicators. The higher SS, the higher the financial indicators of the banks. The coefficients are positive and significant. Concerning the ability of the financial indicators to predict SS, only total assets, the indicator for the size of the banks, can predict the sustainability performance of a bank. There are no significant regressions for the other financial indicators as independent variables. Hence, the sustainability indicator is able to predict the financial performance, but financial indicators are not able to predict the sustainability performance of banks.

To test these findings for robustness, we used bootstrapping with 50 repetitions [79] and added the bank type as specified in Table 1 to the panel regressions. The results are presented in Table 7.

** p &lt; 0.001 for the regression function.

The results presented in Table 7 indicate that the regression is robust. The same regression is significant after 50 bootstrapping repetitions. Furthermore, we did not find significant impacts of the type of bank on the prediction of the financial or the sustainability performance. The only significant coefficient for the type of bank is for the prediction of the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, because state-owned bank have a higher NPL ratio than other banks.

# 6. Discussion

This study analyzed the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of Bangladeshi banks. We used panel regressions with one-year time lags and both financial indicators and a sustainability score SS as dependent and independent lagged variables, respectively. The analysis of all scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh found that a higher SS performance leads to better financial performance one year later. However, the study also suggests that better financial performance does not lead to higher sustainability performance in the following year. The results shine a light on organizational ethics and sustainability in the Bangladeshi banking industry.

Concerning the type of sustainability performance, our results indicate that all three, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, have been increasing in parallel over time. Environmental sustainability and green products and services, however, are not growing stronger than social sustainability, as could have been expected after the introduction of the ERM guidelines. Finally, we found that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

The following sections will discuss the results based on legitimacy theory [20]. According to this theory, the banks in our sample should react to institutional pressure reactively. They do not engage in sustainability activities proactively as would be predicted by strategic CSR [73].

The institutional pressure conducted through the ERM guidelines drives Bangladeshi banks to become more sustainable. They want to take the opportunity of the lower-cost capital provision by Bangladesh Bank and wish to avoid the adverse effects on their legitimacy of not reacting to the.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

guidelines. This reaction increases the banks’ sustainability performance and finally improves their financial performance, as found in many other studies [8,38].

The somewhat surprising result that increased financial performance does not improve sustainability performance can also be interpreted based on legitimacy theory. The banks in the sample react to outside factors and perform socially desired sustainability activities in return for approval of their business activities. However, they do not strategically internalize sustainability. If they did, the additional financial returns would lead to increased sustainability activities in the following year. In our study, however, we only found an impact of the sustainability performance on the lagged financial performance and not the other way around as, for instance, Waddock and Graves [83] report.

We also found a strong connection between the size of the banks, measured by their total assets, and their sustainability performance. This result is also in line with the legitimacy theory [19, 20], stating that bigger organizations are more exposed to public pressure and therefore invest more in their reputation [84] and stakeholder relations [85]. Additionally, Alberici and Querci [35] found that the quality of environmental activities of finance organizations increases with their size.

Similar to Islam and Kokubu [85], we found a general increase in all three types of sustainability activities. Again, legitimacy-based activities are rather reactive and general instead of addressing particular business activities and trying to improve their sustainability performance. Instead, the Bangladeshi banks address prevailing societal norms asking for corporate sustainability in general instead of specific actions that are connected to the banks’ business. Therefore, we also found only a few banks that have implemented green financial products and services.

Concerning organizational ethics and sustainability in South Asia, the results suggest that regulatorily induced sustainability activities have a positive effect on Bangladeshi banks. Some studies in other world regions came to similar conclusions, for instance, in China [7, 86], but also in North America and Europe [87]. The missing connection between financial performance and sustainability performance at a later stage, however, seems to be specific for the Bangladesh sample. Waddock and Graves [83] established this connection and explained it with the institutional impact on both corporate sustainability performance and financial performance. Furthermore, they explain the positive impact of the sustainability performance on financial performance with the good management theory [88, 89]. Hence, it seems that sustainability is not a part of good management in Bangladeshi banks yet and that the banks in the sample do not realize that they can create additional value through sustainability approaches [90].

Another interesting issue related to corporate sustainability in South Asia is that environmental sustainability is more often mentioned by the banks in the sample than social sustainability. However, topics such as inclusion and equality are a top priority in many South Asian countries [4, 91]. The latter includes stakeholder engagement, community building, social inclusion, and so on. These issues should be at the core of sustainable banking in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. However, an earlier study by Khan and Islam [13] suggests a similar result. Hence, it looks like there has not been much change in addressing social sustainability issues. As expected, the Bangladesh ERM did not improve this situation but only influenced the environmental performance of the banks. As Bangladeshi banks seem to have reputational motivations to integrate sustainability into their business, regulations addressing social sustainability might lead to an improvement in this regard.

Overall, it looks like the Bangladeshi banking sector has been increasing its sustainability performance between 2012 and 2016. One reason for this development might be the ERM that has been introduced in 2012. Because of the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance, it not only contributes to improving the industry’s environmental and social performance, but also to its financial performance. This finding is in line with the goals of the ERM and other financial industry sustainability regulations, such as the Chinese Green Credit Policy [7–10]. However, to increase the influence of the banking industry on sustainable development, a more long-term sustainability orientation is needed [92] that is supported by investments in sustainability performance.

# 7. Conclusions

The results of our study contribute to legitimacy theory by showing that legitimacy is not only a driver for CSR reporting but also for CSR-related activities. The banks in our sample have implemented some sustainability activities because external stakeholders expect this behavior. However, the activities are reactive and not firmly connected to the banks’ businesses. Green financial products and services, for instance, are not growing more than general social and environmental sustainability activities.

Our practical contribution addresses strategic sustainability in banking. The results suggest that banks should not only follow sustainability regulations but that they need to develop a strategy to benefit from the sustainable business approach. With regards to regulators, our results suggest that they should also offer training and tools to enable banks to build the necessary capacity to implement sustainability into their businesses.

Our research was limited with regard to data gathering. We only used publicly available data. Future research might use data from the banks that is gathered through interviews, portfolio analyses, as well as product and services analyses. Furthermore, the impacts of the sustainability performance on the environment and society should be analyzed in future research to explore the sustainability effects of financial sustainability regulations. This analysis should be done from a stakeholder perspective.

Increasing evidence suggests that corporate sustainability is paradoxical in nature, as corporates and managers have to achieve economic, social, and environmental goals, simultaneously. While a paradox perspective has been broadly incorporated into sustainability research for more than a decade, it has resulted in limited improvement in our understanding of corporate sustainability paradox management. In this study, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability paradox management by adopting the Smith–Lewis three-stage model of dynamic equilibrium. The results reveal the following:

1. Both environmental and cognitive factors manifest tensions arising from the sustainability paradox.
2. While both proactive and defensive strategies are adopted to manage the tensions embedded in the corporate sustainability, the proactive strategy is more extensively studied in the current literature.
3. Management strategies of corporate sustainability paradox are characterized as multi-level, multi-stage, and dealing with multiple paradoxes.
4. Proactive strategies enable organizations to enjoy short-term and long-term sustainability benefits.

The authors call for further research explicitly addressing the following areas:

1. the paradoxical nature of corporate sustainability management;
2. corporate sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations;
3. the micro-foundations of corporate sustainability paradox management;
4. defensive strategies and new proactive strategies; and
5. a unified standard of sustainability outcomes.

The practical implications of this review are then elaborated. In practice, the results imply that organizations would best manage the corporate sustainability paradox by understanding the paradox and its equilibrium stages. This review and proposed research agenda are expected to deepen interdisciplinary knowledge and set the stage for interested scholars to undertake in their future inquiries.

# INTRODUCTION

Although organizations have been pursuing their economic goals as primary interests for a long time, concerns about the natural environment and social welfare have become essential for organizations to deal with when considering sustainable development (Gladwin et al., 1995; Bansal, 2002; Zollo et al., 2013). Corporate sustainability juxtaposes economic, social, and environmental.

goals in parallel (Bansal, 2005; Schaltegger et al., 2016) to achieve overall social welfare (Schwartz and Carroll, 2008). Organizations that proactively take up their social responsibility display impressive competitiveness and vitality (Thiel, 2017; Ivory and Brooks, 2018; Daddi et al., 2019). Meanwhile, socially or environmentally irresponsible behavior still commonly occurs, even though it hurts the companies’ image and reputation (Lin-Hi and Müller, 2013). While it is challenging to engage simultaneously with economic, social, and environmental goals, it is critical to consider how organizations and managers can successfully manage these multiple goals is critical to gain long-term competitiveness.

Three theoretical perspectives have emerged to address the relationships among economic, social, and environmental responsibilities: business frame, win–win, and business case perspectives. The business frame perspective from earlier scholarly work proposes that pursuing profit goals is an organization’s primary responsibility and criticizes other pursuits as insignificant, as these essentially contradict an organization’s economic benefit (Friedman, 1970). Corporate sustainability scholars have almost abandoned such a view, as it assumes a narrow scope of corporate responsibility and ignores the social and environmental aspects of corporations’ operations (Wood, 1991; Hahn and Figge, 2011; Barnett, 2019). By contrast, the win–win perspective argues that both economic and social missions are attainable at the same time (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015). However, this view overemphasizes their reciprocity or interdependence and ignores the tensions from conflicts between these missions (Turban and Greening, 1997; Albinger and Freeman, 2000; Wagner, 2010), and the trade-offs between specific stakeholder groups are not always avoidable (Bridoux et al., 2016). Meanwhile, the business case frame regards these conflicts as being canceled out, by advocating the instrumental utilization of social pursuits to advance economic aims (Hahn et al., 2015; Hafenbrädl and Waeger, 2017); however, the business case frame has been criticized as insufficient to depict the true notion of corporate sustainability (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002; Hahn and Figge, 2011), resulting in opportunism and a lack of intrinsic motivation for corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement (Nijhof and Jeurissen, 2010).

In this study, the authors attempt to adopt a fourth perspective, the paradox perspective, to review how previous organizational sustainability research has deepened knowledge, echoing Margolis and Walsh’s (2003) call for intricate theorization. The paradox perspective, building on the recent advancement of organizational paradox theory, posits that organizations are rife with persistent, contradictory, yet mutually interdependent demands (Smith and Lewis, 2011). The paradox theory has been applied to explain diverse organizational phenomena, including leadership (e.g., Zhang et al., 2015, 2017) and innovation (e.g., Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009). For corporate sustainability, pursuing competing economic, social, and environment goals at the same time is essentially an organizational paradox (Hahn et al., 2014). The paradox perspective acknowledges the tensions underlying opposing goals. However, in contrast to other perspectives, the paradox perspective centers on the tensions with which organization and management scholars have little choice but to engage (Lindgreen and Maon, 2019), exploring how organizations and decision-makers experience and manage the tensions underlying the sustainability paradox (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Gao and Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2015). For example, in contrast to ignoring or eliminating conflicts (an “either/or” solution), scholars have found that embracing the tensions can lead to an innovative (“both-and”) solution, followed by sustainable outcomes (Tracey et al., 2011; Jarzabkowski et al., 2013; Jay, 2013; Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015; Ortiz-de-Mandojana and Bansal, 2016).

In this study, the authors adopt the dynamic equilibrium model proposed by Smith and Lewis (2011) on organizational paradox theory, attempting to offer a systematic review of academic developments in the management of the corporate sustainability paradox. The dynamic equilibrium model is influential in the literature of organizational paradox. It assumes that opposing forces of a paradox are dynamic rather than static, are persistent rather than transient within complex systems, and can be beneficial and powerful rather than detrimental and threatening. Specifically, the model encompasses three stages: how latent tensions turn into salience, how management strategies enable reinforcing cycles, and the outcomes of paradox management. The first stage introduces environmental factors and individuals’ cognition and rhetoric as the major two types of manifestation forces that render the latent paradoxical forces (e.g., social goal and economic goal) salient and tensional. The second stage proposes how resolution and acceptance strategies fuel vicious and virtuous cycles. The last stage describes how, while focusing on one goal might achieve short-term success, long-term sustainability depends on constant efforts to address the diverging goals in a mutually reinforcing fashion. As a meta-theoretical perspective, the model encompasses the nature, approach, and impact of paradox management, providing a holistic guide to frame and explore how sustainability as disciplinary knowledge deals with its own inherent paradoxes (Smith and Lewis, 2011, p. 297).

The current work is not the first review on the paradox perspective in the corporate sustainability field. In an earlier review, Van der Byl and Slawinski (2015) identify four major approaches in corporate sustainability, that is, win–win, trade-off, integrative, and paradox perspectives. The reviewers mainly offer a conceptual distinction of the paradox perspective from the other three perspectives and highlight the emergence of the paradox perspective in corporate sustainability research. However, up to 2014, the year before Van der Byl and Slawinski’s review was published, only eight articles (e.g., Berger et al., 2007; Wijen and Ansari, 2007) were found to adopt such a paradox lens. Later, in 2018, the Journal of Business Ethics published a thematic symposium on “paradoxes in corporate sustainability.” Among the issued articles, Hahn et al. (2018) are the first to develop a three-aspect framework, namely, descriptive, instrumental, and normative, and locate the six articles in the symposium within different aspects. Thereafter, the paradox perspective gained increasing recognition and sparked intensive research work among corporate sustainability scholars (e.g., Smith and Besharov, 2019; Hengst et al., 2020; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020).

2020). However, as a disciplinary approach, this perspective is still in its infancy in the corporate sustainability area. Considering the rapid emergence of recent literature and the insufficient exploitation of existing research, a comprehensive and systemic review of corporate sustainability from the paradox perspective is timely and imperative. There is no preexisting published review specifically on this topic.

Guided by the three-stage dynamic equilibrium model, in this review, the authors aim to reveal the existing approaches to the manifestation of corporate sustainability tensions, the management of such tensions, and the downstream outcomes. In the rest of this article, the authors first outline the method for the selection of papers in the literature, then present the findings and discuss a future agenda for further corporate sustainability research, and finally outline the implications and conclusions of the review.

# RESEARCH METHODS

To conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability from an organizational paradox perspective (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015), the authors followed the PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) to the extent that they apply to non-medical systematic reviews. The time span for the search was up to December 31, 2019. To ensure the initial search was broad enough, the authors mainly followed two influential reviews, the CSR review of Aguinis and Glavas (2012) and the corporate sustainability review of Van der Byl and Slawinski (2015), and targeted a total of 35 top management journals and specialized niche ones (see Table 1). Finally, the authors searched in corresponding journal databases (e.g., Web of Science) or homepages, using the following keywords in the titles, keywords, or abstracts of the journal articles:

Paradox OR ambivalen∗ OR ambidexterity OR integrat∗ OR institutional logic OR tension OR dilemma OR conflict OR dialect OR Yin-yang OR Tao

AND

sustainab∗ OR CSR OR social enterprise OR social entrepreneurship OR social partnership OR cross-section partnership OR hybrid organization OR microfinance OR social responsib∗ OR social performance OR social responsiveness OR corporate citizenship OR corporate responsibility OR stakeholder responsibilities OR triple bottom line.

To reduce the risk of bias, the whole process of identification and selection of articles was guided by the PRISMA method (see Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow diagram). After searching for each pair of keywords, the initial search returned 2,905 articles, including repeated ones. After filtering out any articles repeated more than once, three authors (coders A, B, and C) scanned the abstracts of the remaining papers to rule out ones irrelevant, or with only minimum relevance. Each article was assigned to two coders. The expected agreement due to chance between coders A and B was 0.59 (κ = 0.96), that between B and C was 0.50 (κ = 0.98), and that between A and C was 0.53 (κ = 0.92). These results illustrate high inter-rater reliability. The articles obviously deflecting from the corporate sustainability theme were removed from the literature pool (these papers concerned business school curricular development, organizational learning, incentive systems, work meaningfulness, trust, organizational innovation, entry decision-making, risk management, supply chain management, etc.). For the remaining articles, the authors further skimmed through the full text to decide whether they should be included in the review and then cross-validated the results. In this step, articles were excluded mainly if they (1) did not reflect a paradox perspective of corporate sustainability; (2) merely focused on the business frame, business case, or win–win perspective, rather than the paradox perspective of corporate sustainability; and (3) had a main theme concerned with sustainability over and above the corporate level, such as government procurement (Preuss, 2007) and the rise of socially responsible investment funds at the regional or national level (Yan et al., 2019).

After the screening, the authors retained a total of 141 articles. Through this process, the extensiveness and concentration of the literature review were simultaneously guaranteed. The journal distribution of these articles is presented in Table 2.

When conducting further analysis, the authors mainly concentrated on the three stages that Smith and Lewis (2011) proposed in their study on the dynamic equilibrium model of organizational paradox. In this theoretical piece, building on earlier foundational work (e.g., Cameron and Quinn, 1988; Lewis, 2000), they define a paradox as consisting of “contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time” (p. 386). A paradox, by definition, cannot be eliminated. Furthermore, any attempt to eliminate the paradoxes will only spark more tensions, resulting in vicious cycles (Vince and Broussine, 1996). To holistically address this cyclical nature of experiencing and managing paradox, Smith and Lewis (2011) theorize three phases: how tensions arise from latency and turn into salience under the stimulation of environmental and individual factors, how actors take purposeful responses to manage paradox mainly through resolution and acceptance, and how short-term outcomes fuel long-term success. An increasing number of studies in broader organizational context have demonstrated that if actors can embrace and be more comfortable with the paradoxes rather than defending themselves and denying the existence of paradoxes (Miron-Spektor et al., 2018), a virtuous cycle would occur and eventually lead to sustainable development. Leaders who display paradoxical traits (e.g., humility and narcissism, Zhang et al., 2017) and are more prominent in leading their subordinates also enable work-promoted outcomes (Zhang et al., 2015). Thus, corporate sustainability studies focusing on addressing the cyclical nature of paradoxes and relevant management practices at different stages are needed.

The three stages and specific items that the authors focused on when this model was applied to investigate corporate sustainability issues are as follows: (1) the manifestation of paradoxical tensions, (2) the management of sustainability paradoxes, and (3) outcomes. First, the authors identified the factors that could render paradoxical tensions salient and categorize them into environmental and individual ones (i.e., environmental plurality, change, scarcity, and

paradoxical cognition, respectively, according to the dynamic equilibrium model). Second, to depict the characteristics of these management processes, the authors analyzed the strategies and decided whether a proactive or defensive response is taken, and further coded these strategies as multi-level (e.g., involving managers from different levels), multi-stage (e.g., a dynamic and cyclic management process), or multi-paradox (e.g., both performing and organizing paradoxes are concerned). Finally, the authors investigated the short-term impacts (e.g., creativity and organizational learning) and long-term outcomes (e.g., economic and social performance enhancement) of these management strategies and their related practices. As for the initial screening of the focal articles, three of the authors independently analyzed the data. After each round of analysis, the authors discussed the coding together to resolve inconsistencies and ensure the accuracy and validity of the findings.

# FINDINGS

In this section, the authors answer the following questions. First, what factors make sustainability tensions salient? Second, what are the strategies (e.g., proactive or defensive characteristics) to manage sustainability paradoxes? Third, what are the outcomes (short-term and long-term)? A list of the representative articles and their coding information is found in Table 3.

In corporate sustainability research (see Table 3), hybrid organizations, such as social enterprises, attract much attention. Other hybrid forms, such as cross-sector collaboration, are also discussed in sustainability studies. Unlike social enterprises, which focus on the centrality of their social mission (Chell, 2007), for-proﬁt ﬁrms are under increasing attention because of their greater emphasis on economic values; nevertheless, this is still under-researched. On the methodology front, while single-case longitudinal research is still the most popular, quantitative examinations have been increasing in recent years.

# The Manifestation of Corporate Sustainability Paradoxes

Two sets of triggering factors that could manifest organizational paradoxical tensions have emerged, consistent with Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, namely, environmental factors and actors’ paradoxical cognition. The former emphasizes plurality, change, and the scarcity of the external environment, which all contribute to providing the material conditions of a paradox. The latter focuses on the actors themselves and highlights the role of personal frames and cognition. The research into paradoxical corporate sustainability also underlines these factors (see Table 3).

# Environmental Factors

In general, organizational paradox research has recognized the importance of environmental factors in providing the material conditions that lead to perplexing choices (Scherer et al., 2013). In the context of accelerated globalization (Slawinski et al., 2020), marketization and professionalization (Bruneel et al., 2020), environmental degradation (Daddi et al., 2019), and public health concerns (Iivonen, 2018), plurality, change, and scarcity emerging from complex environments enable sustainability paradoxes to occur, owing to competing economic, social, and environment goals (Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020). Specifically, plurality has been manifested in the pursuit of the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997), multiple institutional logics (Dahlmann and Grosvold, 2017), and multiple stakeholder demands (Smith et al., 2013). Any excessive concern about any goal may be detrimental to sustainability outcomes (Jay et al., 2017; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020); thus, tensions appear. These kinds of tensions would directly reflect on firms’ mission statements that combine economic pursuits and social or environmental visions. Some researchers show that the co-existence of social and economic/financial logics (Yan et al., 2019; Bruneel et al., 2020), market and community logics (Smets et al., 2015), or separate and integrated logics (Gümüsay et al., 2020) would provoke thorough tensions around the organization’s structure and identity and change would ensue as institutional logics define the material practices, assumptions, values, and beliefs of organizations (Thornton et al., 2012). Other researchers, mainly from the perspective of stakeholder management, find that tensions would emerge as a consequence of heterogeneous opinions, confusion around roles, and diffused power or responsibility (Slade Shantz et al., 2020) when considering a wider range of stakeholders (both insiders and outsiders) in the sustainability context, of whom there are essentially inconsistent expectations (Iivonen, 2018).

Many studies have stressed that, apart from changes due to prominent trends, the dynamic nature of an organization’s environment requires proactive adaptation for both the present and the future (Waldman and Bowen, 2016). For instance, the changes in organizational temporal structure and leadership styles (Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018), which are deeply rooted in a disparity in practice between “what should be” and “what is” (Winkler et al., 2020), would significantly provoke corporate sustainability tensions.

The triggering role of scarcity is magnified when researchers investigate special settings, such as entrepreneurship and social enterprises. Entrepreneurs with a paradoxical frame have limited resources, time, and expertise for sustainability options (Hahn et al., 2014). Davies and Doherty (2019) suggest that social enterprises struggle with more intensive sustainability tensions because of their insufficient attractiveness for capital.

the difficulty of hiring employees with similar identities, and stakeholder legitimacy. However, almost the entire discussion around environmental factors concentrates at the theoretical level. At this conceptual level, contradictory elements manifest more than interrelated ones, which essentially distinguishes paradoxical tensions of corporate sustainability from other tensions.

# Managing Sustainability Paradoxes

# Proactive vs. Defensive Responses

While firms constantly experience sustainability paradoxes, how firms or critical actors respond varies. Broadly, responses or management strategies can be categorized as proactive versus defensive (Hahn et al., 2018; Iivonen, 2018). Three major distinctions have been made between the two types. First, active response requires acknowledging the existence of paradoxes and the correlation between their conflicting elements (Lewis and Smith, 2014), whereas a defensive response involves actors who often deny or ignore the existence of such contradictions. Second, proactively responding actors regard it as feasible to achieve multiple contradictory goals at the same time, whereas those with a defensive strategy tend to divert or eliminate the tension between economic, environmental, and social demands (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015). Third, actors adopting proactive responses often propose or make a fundamental change or a deviation from the existing stable state, while defensive responses constitute only a minor “natural extension” (Iivonen, 2018, p. 318) of the existing pattern.

# Proactive strategies

Proactive strategies encompass two critical components, differentiation and integration (Poole and Van de Ven, 1989; Smith and Tushman, 2005; Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009; Smith, 2014). Differentiation includes spatial and temporal separations of competing elements within different boundaries (Smith et al., 2013). For example, the segmentation mechanism divides partnerships into sub-tracks, which then act as intermediaries among cross-departmental partners to buffer conflicts (Stadtler, 2018). Moreover, by separating and differently managing stakeholders’ benefits and expectations, a hybrid organization could successfully navigate between “community-focused” and “client-focused” orientations (Kannothra et al., 2018). For integration, previous work highlights the role of linking mechanisms (Hahn et al., 2016). A structural design, such as a hybrid set of members of the board (Bruneel et al., 2020), could combine business and social logics, and formal processes that regulate cross-function interaction (Battilana et al., 2015) could facilitate coordination and resource exchange. The authors observe that integration mechanisms are specifically addressed by some multinational enterprises. For example, Acquier et al. (2018) observe the international Japanese enterprise processes in multi-functional teams and cross-regional CSR projects to achieve highly integrated CSR, namely, increased professionalization and globalization, worldwide coordination, and the institutionalization of CSR. Some researchers argue that both differentiation and integration are indispensable for the organization (Smith and Tushman, 2005; Smith and Lewis, 2011) and can be utilized ambidextrously to produce a synergistic effect. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) came up with a segmenting–bridging–demarcating loop whereby both integration and differentiation are applied to daily work. When entering the German market, an Islamic bank uses polyphony (segmentation) to support individuals’ practices and polysemy (integration) to provide uniformity, which combine to foster organizational elasticity (Gümüsay et al., 2020). However, it is noteworthy that the current literature fails to answer the extent to which the firm should differentiate between and integrate its competing economic, social, and environmental goals simultaneously.

Existing research has investigated other proactive paradox management practices. First, well-utilized communication, as is important in the CSR research (e.g., Zhao et al., 2020), could be a vital method to engage in the sustainability paradox. A good example could be the transformation from self-persuasive rhetoric to the three-step agonistic CSR rhetoric (Winkler et al., 2020). By using (1) invitational rhetoric to define visions as provisional and revisable, (2) listening rhetoric to understand the reasons for dissension, and (3) rearticulation rhetoric to transfer authority from the speaker to the audience, the dynamic communication process finally leads to a virtuous cycle. Apart from internal conveyance, external communication strategies emphasizing the firms’ commitment to the environment, which may be further reinforced by third-party certifications, could maintain customers’ trust (Daddi et al., 2019).

Second, ongoing engagement of stakeholders helps them to live with paradoxes, as their expectations of conflicts are the primary source of paradoxical tensions. The interaction between managers and stakeholders could be regarded as a process of knowledge co-creation, generating the “power from below” to reshape the power relations to manage the tensions (Bolton and Landells, 2015), and the proactive engagement of both internal and external stakeholders could lead to mutual appreciation (Slawinski et al., 2020) to further address the paradoxical issues.

Third, some researchers regard paradoxical thinking itself as a valid approach to handle tensions, but the guardrails—leadership expertise, formal structures, stakeholder relationships—are still needed to keep the practice on track (Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020).

# Defensive strategy

Existing research favors investigating the proactive kind of responses to the sustainability paradox. However, in practice, companies often adopt defensive actions (Lewis, 2000; Smith and Lewis, 2012). When an organization’s primary goal is threatened (e.g., by institutional complexity), the organization tends to react defensively to minimize internal conflicts and/or external threats to its legitimacy. In the organizational paradox literature, a focus on defensive reactions to paradoxical situations has generated a vast array of categorizations (see Schad et al., 2016, for a recent review). For example, Lewis (2000) divides defensive reactions into six categories: splitting, projection, repression, regression, reaction formation, and ambivalence (Lewis, 2000; Iivonen, 2018). To blame a scapegoat, which is actually the combination of splitting and projection, and to simply repress unpleasant emotions and thoughts are much more heatedly discussed than other defensive reactions in the current corporate sustainability paradox management literature (Vince and Broussine, 1996). Personal framing, such as looking at a big picture or making favorable comparisons, could also be regarded as an effective defensive mechanism to neglect problematic elements (Child, 2020).

In addition, some researchers observe that firms adopt defensive actions to transfer tensions to their external stakeholders, such as customers. For example, Iivonen (2018) points out that the Coca-Cola Company completely denies the tensions between its economic goals and the obesity problem, blaming customers for their irrational choices and lack of self-regulation. Another example is the practice of the European Oil and Gas Supermajors, which reduce or avoid tensions through impression management (Ferns et al., 2019). By making use of three myths—the techno-fix, the Promethean oilman, and climate partnerships—these companies have successfully legitimized their environmentally harmful businesses. Daddi et al. (2019) also investigate how paper producers, textile companies, and tanneries tried to balance environmental engagement and competitiveness through defensive strategies. To obtain recycled raw material, the paper producers focused on improving their competitiveness through more significant technological inputs or improved selection management. For instance, to avoid such tension arising from paradoxes, a tannery that produced high-quality leather for luxury brands directly sold.

# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management

chrome (a material used to produce leather) recovered from the process to tanneries that produced inferior leather. In general, organizations tend to adopt defensive responses when their core business collides directly with sustainability development, as they consider these contradictions to be irreconcilable and threatening their survival (Iivonen, 2018; Daddi et al., 2019).

# Factors spurring proactive actions

The academic community concurs that defensive reactions would create negative feedback loops (Smith and Lewis, 2011) and ethical hazards (Hall et al., 2007) in the long run. Some researchers have investigated the individual and environmental factors that could encourage a proactive response and promote a virtuous cycle. Several scholars have reiterated the role of individual factors, including cognitive and behavioral complexity and emotion regulation, in the dynamic equilibrium model, among others (Corner and Pavlovich, 2016; Hahn et al., 2016; Waldman and Bowen, 2016; Slawinski et al., 2020). Leaders’ capabilities to maintain consistency in their behavior and emotions while navigating toward inconsistent goals are particularly highlighted (Smith and Lewis, 2011; Slawinski et al., 2020). Prior work has also pointed out some organizational factors in shaping the actions taken concerning the tensions. In addition to the organizational dynamic capability proposed in the dynamic equilibrium model (Smith and Lewis, 2011; Schneider and Clauß, 2020), strategic agility, including strategic sensitivity, collective commitment, and resource fluidity (Ivory and Brooks, 2018), and knowledge absorptive capability (Garst et al., 2020) have been found to be crucial in managing the corporate sustainability paradox.

# Characteristics of Management Strategies

Corporate sustainability paradoxes are “not linear or singular but were experienced by any actor, at any stage in the strategy process, according to the specific tasks they were implementing” (Hengst et al., 2020, p. 258). When handling the sustainability paradox, changes in the external environments may trigger new tensions that are sustained in accordance with previous tensions (Hahn et al., 2018). Thus, to manage sustainability paradox, coordination at different levels and stages as well as varied types of paradoxes have to be considered.

# Multi-Level

Tensions in sustainability can appear at different levels, including individual, organizational, and societal levels (Hahn et al., 2015). Most prior research concentrates on the individual and organizational levels. At the individual level, sustainability-related managers and key decision-makers, rather than employees, are the primary targets of focus. For instance, Carollo and Guerci (2018) explore how sustainability managers manage ambivalence in identity, and Wry and York (2017) analyze how social entrepreneurs understand the contradictions between different logics. At the organizational level, most studies investigate tensions in inter-organizational and cross-sectional (i.e., government, business, and civil society) relations (Le Ber and Branzei, 2010; Vurro et al., 2010; Stadtler, 2018). In mainstream CSR research, some efforts have been made to connect the micro-level to the macro-level (e.g., Jones et al., 2017; Poonamallee and Joy, 2018), but organizational paradox scholars point out that cross-level interactions around the sustainability paradox are underexplored (Schad et al., 2016), with a few exceptions. For example, Soderstrom and Heinze (2020) investigate a business collective from a social aggregation perspective. They reveal how such a type of organization serves as an intermediary based on how individual actions could converge into organizational responses, and how organizational practice influences individuals’ reactions. Furthermore, managers from middle management and top management teams could change and reshape each other’s frames, including business, business case, and paradoxical frames, among others (Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018). Managers may also be influenced by stakeholders and react differently, such as by adjusting priorities and constraining discretion responsibilities (Liu et al., 2015). Notwithstanding the growing literature on this topic, societal level and cross-level investigations are still scant.

# Multi-Stage

It is critical to recognize that the sustainability paradox is embedded in “long-term, iterative, reflexive, adaptive and co-evolving processes” (Smith and Lewis, 2011, p. 23). While most scholars agree that paradox management is a dynamic multi-stage process, researchers’ understanding of what dynamic means varies. Some scholars have argued that, as enterprises develop, the management goes through different periods that require stage-specific investigations, whereas other scholars emphasize a circular process. A good illustration of the former view is Puma’s practice in managing sustainability paradoxes in different periods (Baumann-Pauly et al., 2016). Puma has gone through three main development stages, paired with specific communication strategies for each. When forming connections with stakeholders, Puma first used a universal language through a dialogue platform. Then, Puma tried to select an appropriate language and reasons for each stakeholder group establishing common ground. Finally, Puma adopted a mixed legalization policy. A new reporting structure that directly linked sustainability data to financial data was developed in the third period. While these conversations may initially have been manipulative, they resulted in committed partnerships over time.

The existing literature has proposed a cyclic approach to understanding the dynamic nature of the sustainability paradox. Amaeshi (2010) uses a case study to develop a recursive model of paradoxes in social enterprises, conceptualizing the governance paradox as part of a social behavior cycle consisting of social context and structure. The governing paradox requires a (re)interpretation of the paradox, leading to a (new) continuous cycle of action. The recursive model describes the cyclical process of gradually improving the ability of boards to understand and manage these paradoxes over time. Smets et al. (2015) explore how insurers balance the contradictory relationship between market logic and community logic. They find that only the segmentation practice needs to be bridged, that bridging leads to demarcating, and that demarcating is confirmed again as a method to minimize this contradiction and maintain logical clarity. Therefore, these three mechanisms follow a circular.

# Resulting Downstream Effects

# Multi-Paradox

Organizational paradox theorists have categorized organizational paradoxes into various types. For example, Feldman and Pentland (2003) depict the tensions in organizational routings as stability vs. flexibility, Waldman and Bowen (2016) identify the tensions between agency and communion in leadership practice, and Besharov (2014) argues that there are relational tensions between managers and frontline employees. To understand the nature of paradoxes better, a more nuanced typology has been developed. Here, the authors keep with the widely accepted four-type categorization, namely, performing, learning, organizing, and belonging paradoxes, following Smith and Lewis (2011). While the sustainability paradox can be any combination of these four types of paradoxes, the authors contend that the performing type is most fundamental to understand the sustainability paradox. A performing paradox arises from competing goals, demands, and strategies, such as the simultaneous pursuit of economic, social, and environmental goals (Hahn et al., 2018). Most existing research on the sustainability paradox focuses on the performing paradox.

Some other researchers have also looked at multiple types of sustainability paradoxes. For example, the co-existence of a social mission and economic goals can involve various types of paradoxical tensions. First, an organizing paradox emerges when firms hire and socialize employees (Battilana and Dorado, 2010; Battilana et al., 2015), or (re)design their organizational structure (Battilana et al., 2012; Stadtler, 2018) and legal forms (Haigh and Hoffman, 2011; Battilana et al., 2012). Second, a belonging paradox occurs when organizational actors have opposing values, beliefs, or identities while confronting and resolving a set of competing goals (Phillips and Tracey, 2007; Battilana and Dorado, 2010; Smets et al., 2015; Demers and Gond, 2020). For example, employees conceptualize their roles differently in CSR activities (Seivwright and Unsworth, 2016). Third, a learning paradox could be salient since success in sustainability requires both short-term and long-term efforts (Midttun, 2007; Hahn, 2009; Pache and Santos, 2013).

However, in articles that identify multiple types of sustainability paradoxes, regardless of how the authors classify the types, they tend to simplify the complexity underlying the simultaneously co-existing paradoxes. Instead, the existing literature has concentrated on certain types of paradoxes (mostly the performing paradox), and/or discussed the identified paradoxes separately. This separation tendency could constrain our understanding of the sustainability paradox’s intricate nature. A few exceptional studies have appeared recently. For example, Vallaster et al. (2020) adopt a comprehensive framework to investigate how dynamic capabilities affect various paradoxes differently. Winkler et al. (2020) show how agonistic rhetoric solves performing, organizing, and belonging paradoxes jointly. Therefore, the authors conclude that the complex relationships between various types of sustainability paradoxes, Theoretically, proactive responses to organizational paradoxes could lead to sustainable outcomes. In the short term, individuals, teams, and organizations are likely to display excellence through enhanced learning and creativity, flexibility and resilience, and stimulated potential, which would pave the way for long-term success (Smith and Lewis, 2011).

# Short-Term Effects

A body of research has empirically proved that proactive strategies could lead directly to tension mitigation. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) reveal how contradictory elements could co-exist, alleviating tensions and bringing benefits in daily work at the same time. The proactive shift toward agonistic rhetoric helps the organization to transcend tensions and to foster CSR (Winkler et al., 2020). Proactive strategies could also facilitate knowledge creation. Bolton and Landells (2015) suggest that the knowledge base created during the process of management–stakeholder interaction could further generate the power that impacts business vision. While Hahn et al. (2014) theoretically propose that sustainability challenges stimulate creative insights, Calic and Mosakowski (2016) prove that a sustainability orientation improves the innovation of entrepreneurs’ final projects. Wry and York (2017) also show that entrepreneurs who navigate dual logics have greater possibility of proactively integrating these and developing creative business models. Gümüsay et al. (2020) regard this resilience as the ability the organization gains from the adoption of a proactive mechanism to avoid permanently suffering the loss or being estranged. This can help the corporation to perceive and correct a tendency toward deviation and to handle emergencies.

Some researchers have discussed how the management of the corporate sustainability paradox affects corporate legitimacy. For example, sustainability efforts (Calic and Mosakowski, 2016) and paradoxical thinking (Scherer et al., 2013) could enhance and maintain the legitimacy gained from collective awareness and value (Dart, 2004). Moreover, organizations could obtain other instant benefits, such as corporate credibility (Schneider and Clauß, 2020), greater market engagement (Kannothra et al., 2018; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020), and competitiveness (Fosfuri et al., 2016) by positively reacting to sustainability paradoxes, which would contribute to long-term value creation.

# Long-Term Effects

Scholars have usually used synergistically increased organizational economic and social performance to depict sustainability success, even though economic and social pursuits could be detrimental to each other in the short run (Margolis and Walsh, 2003) and the effects on social or environmental performance are assumed only to manifest after a long period of time (Hoffman et al., 2010). Typical indicators of economic performance include profit, sales, or their annual rates of increase (Pache and Santos, 2013). Social performance is reflected in greater social impact, such as higher social employment.

# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management

(Pache and Santos, 2013; Battilana et al., 2015; Smith and Besharov, 2019), community regeneration (Slawinski et al., 2020), and community income increase (Kannothra et al., 2018). Proactive responses to the corporate sustainability paradox, which is the determining precondition for a virtuous cycle (Smith and Lewis, 2011), have been verified to enhance economic and social performance simultaneously (Crilly and Sloan, 2012; Pache and Santos, 2013; Smith and Besharov, 2019).

By contrast, defensive reactions that would lead to a vicious cycle cannot facilitate sustainable development (Smith and Lewis, 2011). Defensive responses, which are usually argued to be a potential barrier to sustainability, may counterintuitively bring some positive effects (Ferns et al., 2019). For example, a luxury leather producer that sells recycled material to other tanneries and refuses to produce inferior leather itself (a defensive strategy) successfully maintains the trust of its customers toward their own product quality (Daddi et al., 2019).

# AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

In this study, using the PRISMA methodology, the authors reviewed the existing research with a paradox perspective on sustainability. By adopting Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, the authors revealed how the prior sustainability literature concerns the investigation of the manifestation process of tensions among sustainability goals, the management strategies that organizations use to respond to the tensions, and resulting outcomes.

During synthesizing and mapping of previous studies, ample future research opportunities appear. First, the authors propose that the nature of the corporate sustainability paradox (i.e., its constitution vs. its social construction) requires further exploration, including theoretical clarity and empirical examination. In the mainstream organizational paradox literature, there is an ontological debate on whether paradoxical tensions are inherent in the system or socially constructed (Clegg, 2002; El-Sawad et al., 2004; Ashcraft et al., 2009). Smith and Lewis (2011) propose an integrative approach by arguing for the corporate sustainability paradox’s dual nature in simultaneously highlighting the roles of material conditions and organizational actors during the manifestation process. With a quantum approach, Hahn and Knight (2020) conceptualize the paradox as both inherent and socially constructed (for a counterpoint, see Li, 2020).

This debate penetrates sustainability research and potentially shapes management strategies. With a few exceptions, such as Sharma and Bansal (2017), who directly bring the opposing poles together by revealing the interaction between action and cognition, the nature of the sustainability paradox in the current literature is yet to be fully explored. Rather than looking for clues as to whether the researcher holds a material view (e.g., Waldman and Bowen, 2016) or a socially constructive view (e.g., Child, 2020; Vallaster et al., 2020), this fundamental question requires more in-depth exploration.

Second, it is desirable to investigate the sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations. When investigating management of the corporate sustainability paradox, the main focus of the existing literature is on social enterprises or non-profit organizations, not for-profit organizations (Smith et al., 2013; Battilana et al., 2015; Wry and York, 2017; Child, 2020). Yet tensions are also embedded in the often hybrid forms of for-profit organizations, bringing paradox management insights to researchers (e.g., Smets et al., 2015; Acquier et al., 2018; Schneider and Clauß, 2020). Moreover, for-profit organizations, originally holding a business logic, may experience hurdles that are significantly different from those of social enterprises when pursuing corporate sustainability. Therefore, drawing from the “tensions” between researching social organizations and for-profit business organizations, the authors suggest that an organization’s form (non-profit vs. for-profit) could largely influence how the organization responds to and manages the sustainability paradox.

Third, the authors encourage more research on the micro-foundation of management of the corporate sustainability paradox. Organizational psychology would shed light on this line of research. There is a need to explore how the cognitions, attitudes, and emotions of managers and employees (cf., Chin et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020) play a role in corporate sustainability paradox management. For instance, the significant role of paradoxical thinking is reflected in its dual effect. On one hand, individuals with the paradoxical frame are more acutely sensitized to and aware of the interconnections among seemingly opposing demands. On the other hand, a general tendency to endorse paradoxical thinking can “motivate” actors to seek solutions proactively. In the organizational paradox literature, paradoxical thinking has been identified as an effective factor to benefit creative behavior and in-role performance (Miron-Spektor et al., 2011, 2018). In the sustainability literature, some researchers have investigated the paradoxical frames of managers (Hahn et al., 2014; Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018; Schneider and Clauß, 2020), specifically CSR managers (Carollo and Guerci, 2018). The authors argue that paradox leadership (behavior) (Zhang et al., 2015, 2017) also has the potential to foster the paradoxical thinking and behaviors of subordinates, thereby creating a supportive climate for corporate sustainability.

Furthermore, the role of employee engagement together with its underlying micro-foundation are greatly ignored when using a paradox perspective compared to those in the traditional CSR research (Glavas, 2016; De Roeck and Maon, 2018). Based on the current efforts (e.g., Demers and Gond, 2020), the authors consider the mechanisms underlying the actors’ cognitive frames to be missing in the context of sustainability issues. While Child (2020) mentions that one’s cognitive frame can be altered, questions like how managers reconstruct their frames or how the manipulation of framings on suitability issues impact the paradox management and sustainability outcome would extend our understanding of the micro-foundation of the sustainability paradox (Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018).

Fourth, some researchers challenge the prevailing opinion on proactive and defensive strategies, which urges more research.

# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management

investigations. Originally, a proactive strategy was favored as it would lead to a virtuous cycle and achieve sustainability outcomes (Smith and Lewis, 2011). There is increasing research, especially by those observing controversial industry practices, implying the lack of a direct link between proactive responses and immediately appealing performance outcomes (Iivonen, 2018; Ferns et al., 2019). Moreover, some recent studies have revealed successful sustainability achievement through defensive strategies, in addition to proactive management strategies (Daddi et al., 2019; Garst et al., 2020). The authors propose that these inconsistencies require further examination of hybrid of proactive and defensive strategies in corporate sustainability management.

Finally, a unified standard for a sustainability outcome is needed in future research. In some studies, the authors use the short-term effects to claim promising long-term achievements without substantial supporting evidence. In other cases, some researchers investigate whether the company could use its profit to cover the costs of social extension (e.g., Slawinski et al., 2020). Essentially, these examples reflect the lack of a unified standard on what sustainability outcomes actually mean. Therefore, the authors propose that sustainability scholars and practitioners should work together on a list of more effective indicators and a proper time span for which to evaluate sustainability outcomes.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The paradoxical nature of corporate sustainability, namely, the need to address social, ecological, and commercial concerns simultaneously, is at the core of corporate sustainability research. The literature on how corporations and firm decision-makers should address the sustainability paradox has rapidly evolved in the past decade. Hence, in this study, the authors reviewed existing sustainability research prior to 2020 when the paradox perspective received direct attention (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015; Hahn et al., 2018). After a systematic review of 141 articles published in the top management and corporate sustainability journals, the authors adopted Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model to inductively reveal how prior sustainability researchers have investigated how tensions have manifested among sustainability goals, the management strategies by which organizations respond to the tensions, and the resulting outcomes. The authors then offered a road map for future inquiries on integrating the organizational paradox perspective and corporate sustainability research.

This review has several practical implications. Leaders of firms would best manage the corporate sustainability paradox by understanding the paradox and its equilibrium stages. Understanding how and why firms are affected by opposing tensions and the stage they are in enables firms to better position their firms and develop their own strategies, for example, by pursuing social aims associated with their core business (Kaul and Luo, 2018). Even though firms struggle to reach all their competing goals, which constitutes the sustainability paradox (e.g., Davies and Doherty, 2019), the key to achieving sustainability is not to ignore or escape any contradictory goals. Instead, leaders should learn to be “paradox-savvy” to promote proactive strategies at different levels of their management practice (Waldman and Bowen, 2016).

For middle managers of firms, this review suggests that firms could provide development training on how middle managers attend to these tensions and how middle managers communicate this information from firm leaders and top managers to operational managers and employees. Middle managers are recognized as the major force resisting organizational change (Miles, 1997; Floyd and Lane, 2000). Without adequate commitment to organizational change actions, middle managers can cause organizational inertia or chaos (Huy, 2002). Therefore, attention should be paid to how middle managers, as the information synthesizer and facilitator between top and operating management levels, categorize, blend, and sell information on the sustainability paradoxes in the overall setting of a firm’s strategies and implementations.

In conclusion, an understanding of how the existing literature has advanced knowledge of the management corporate sustainability paradox is timely for both scholars and practitioners alike. By incorporating Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, this review has distinguished the paradox perspective from previous major approaches in corporate sustainability management. It further provides findings on how corporate sustainability tensions manifest and are managed, and how they impact firms and society as a whole.

Abstract: Green shared vision (GSV) has provided a research prototype for past green management research topics; however, few studies have examined the confusion related to environmental issues among employees. Therefore, to fill the aforementioned research gap, this study used psychological ownership theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV. This study explored the relationships of GSV with employee green confusion (EGC) and employee environmental performance (EEP) as well as the mediating effect of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. The research results indicate that GSV positively affects GPPO, EGC, and EEP. Moreover, GSV also influences behavior and performance through personal psychological processes. Thus, if an enterprise wishes to establish GSV, it must adopt a series of supporting measures, including improving members’ GPPO, to effectively reduce EGC and improve EEP to realize the goal of sustainable development.

# 1. Introduction

Corporate strategies worldwide are affected by environmental management issues [1]. When enterprises support environmental protection and actively participate in environmental management, they not only pursue corporate values but also improve their image by complying with environmental regulations [2]. Enterprises should embrace the philosophy of sustainability with a creative mind in this environmentalistic age [3, 4]. In general, shared visions are developed at the organizational, group, or individual levels to generate motivation for achieving transformation from a present status to a desirable end status [5]. When the organizational planner has a strong vision, the sustainable development of a company is promoted [6]. Obtaining a better understanding of the driving forces behind the phenomena might help new companies to integrate resources and enhance their corporate performance [7]. A corporate shared vision is a key factor affecting the competitive advantage of a corporation over other entities. Currently, sustainable development has become an important issue worldwide. The pursuit and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) has become a trend for companies. Therefore, corporate sustainability has become a major topic.

Corporate sustainability refers to decreasing the waste of natural resources (especially nonrenewable resources) to zero during enterprise operational activities to reduce the damage caused by corporate activities on society or the environment [8]. Corporate sustainability has become an indispensable strategy for many companies today [9 – 11]. Such strategies are gradually being integrated into company activities and culture, whether with respect to the corporate system (including operations), strategies, organizational systems, or stakeholders (internal and external as well as social and environmental) [12]. Corporate sustainability has become the basis of sustainable success [13]. When employees and organizations have different values, implementing a developed sustainability plan is difficult [14]. Employees are the core resource of an enterprise [15]. Employees play an important role in maintaining the competitive advantage of an organization. They also determine the performance of the organization [16]. A company’s ability to achieve a competitive advantage is related to its ability to employ excellent talent [17].

Given the aforementioned information, employees play an important role when designing sustainable development strategies for an enterprise. The occurrence of employee green confusion (EGC) cannot be ruled out when employees promote green shared vision (GSV). However, studies on green confusion have not focused on the views of an enterprise’s employees. Most of these studies have examined consumer orientation and have focused on the effects of greenwash on consumers, such as the effects of greenwash on green consumer confusion and green trust [18] as well as environmental and product perceptions [19]. Thus, employee orientation related to confusion in the field of corporate sustainability has been rarely discussed. To fill this research gap, the present study proposes a new concept called EGC. This study refers to the definition of Chen and Chang [18] to define EGC as the confusion of employees regarding the environmental characteristics of company products or services. The present study developed an integral framework of employee environmental performance (EEP). It also investigated the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP as well as the mediating effects of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. Environmentalism is an important corporate issue today, and EEP is critical to corporate sustainability. This research enables a better understanding of the effects of a shared vision and various types of integration on corporate management.

Studies have rarely used a theoretical basis to explore the effect of organizational members’ psychological processes on the organization’s environmental management performance [1,20 – 26]. This study investigated the effect of GSV on GPPO, EGC, and EEP by focusing on company staff and using psychological ownership (PO) theory and expected price theory. We used the obtained findings to fill the research gap on EGC issues in corporate sustainability research. This study proposes a comprehensive conceptual structure to explore the effect of company members’ psychological processes regarding the company’s green issues on the company’s green management performance. The integrated conceptual structure is displayed in Figure 1.

# 2. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

# 2.1. Negative Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC)

Given the global trend of concern for environmental issues, existing strict environmental regulations, and customers’ perception of the environment, companies must develop suitable legal strategies to gain valuable resources [27,28]. A collective strategic direction can be encapsulated in a shared vision, which guides company members’ actions according to a certain approach [29]. A shared vision can also be used to encourage corporate employees to exhibit excellent performance [30]. A shared vision is a key aspect of strategic management for a company because it indicates the unique objective, general direction, and practices of the company [31]. The method used by an organization to develop a shared vision has become the primary focus of environmental management research. The concept of GSV is defined on the basis of environmental friendliness and sustainable development [24]. Managers establish clear and common environmental goals for future organizational development, which enables the organization to supervise the green behavior and performance of employees as well as minimize EGC.

Staff confusion may occur when a company provides excessively similar, excessively complex, or an excessive amount of product or service information regarding SDGs. The larger the amount of information processed by an individual, the higher is their likelihood of experiencing information overload [32]. Information overload creates confusion [33], and EGC may affect a company’s SDGs. This research refers to the definition of EGC provided by Chen and Chang [18], who stated that EGC refers to employees’ inability to correctly understand the environmental characteristics of their company’s products and services as well as the characteristics of its environmental policy during information processing. Therefore, companies must formulate a clear green common vision and effectively obtain employee recognition to encourage the green behavior and performance of employees [24, 34,35]. GSV can encourage the green behavior and performance of employees, effectively develop employee recognition, and eliminate EGC. GSV is negatively related to EGC. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 1 (H1). GSV is negatively associated with EGC.

# 2.2. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

Currently, many companies are facing challenges caused by the rise of global environmental awareness, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and increasing consumer environmental awareness. To ensure that valuable resources are obtained legally, an organization must formulate a suitable legal strategy [27, 28]. A carefully planned and designed company vision facilitates employees’ actions and decisions and inspires them to move toward a shared vision [36]. A shared vision is a common future goal set by an organization’s manager for the development of the organization. It conveys the norms and beliefs of the company to members. A shared vision can motivate employees to perform [30] and exceed expectations related to their work performance [34].

When an organization proactively performs environmental actions, its long-term goals with respect to corporate greening are conveyed to its staff [37]. Environmental improvement performance depends on whether a shared vision exists between staff and managers, especially when environmental strategies require intensive staff engagement [38]. Above all, the process of combining corporate environmental performance and strategy is profoundly affected by the shared vision [39]. A shared vision can reduce the adverse effects caused by senior team members setting different goals and having conflicting views [40,41]. Moreover, such a vision can prevent the fragmentation of a team.

Team members must establish a shared vision, and continual interaction, practice, and reflection can improve team performance [42]. With regard to EEP, organization managers can influence green purchasing behavior [43], promote environmental market-oriented strategies [44], and encourage

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

employees to have a responsible attitude toward environmental issues [ 45 ]. Organizations should always encourage members who possess good intentions, especially those who adopt a responsible attitude toward environmental issues. This step would enable employees to perform responsible actions when environmental problems arise.

Employees play an important role in promoting green management in an enterprise. Paillé and Meija-Morelos [ 46 ] defined EEP as the performance of employees’ compliance with company norms, and their interaction and communication based on personal environmental knowledge to relevant stakeholders. Expectancy–valence theory is a cognitive motivation theory that connects the energy of an individual’s motivation or willingness to strive for goals and expectations and obtain the expected value of the incentives to a specific purpose [47].

According to expectancy–valence theory, the choice, performance, and continuity of organization members’ achievement behaviors are affected by expectations and values [48], which results in individuals investing increased efforts to obtain expected values [49 ]. When a company develops a suitable GSV, the GSV motivates employees to strive for goals and values that contribute to employee behavior. Related research has indicated that a shared vision is crucial for enhancing employee environmental behavior [24,34,35,50]. Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2). GSV is positively associated with EEP.

# 2.3. Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

Psychological Ownership (PO) refers to the relationship between a person and an object that is closely connected with the self [ 51 ]. The concept of ownership is partially based on the research of consumer behavior regarding the extended self and possession [ 52 ,53 ]. Isaacs [ 54 ] indicated that the thoughts in a person’s mind become a part of them. For an individual, when property is accepted in the mind, it becomes “mine” [55]. Legal ownership can provide an opportunity for individuals to assimilate themselves into a company and become part of it, which can enhance the emergence of ownership as a mental status [56]. Because ownership connects possessors to targets, when employees link work with emotion, their connection with the work becomes closer. Furthermore, positive attitudes and thoughts are generated to further promote work performance [57 ]. Ownership is a mental status experienced by humans in which people consider themselves to own a target (nonmaterial or material in nature) completely or partially [ 58]. According to Pierce et al. [58 ], PO refers to a personal sense of possession held by an individual for an immaterial or material object (“this is mine!”). Due to PO, an individual is willing to take responsibility or sacrifice for their organization [59].

For the sustainable development of an enterprise, the degree of PO of company members for their company’s green products affects their behavior and attitude as well as the company’s green management performance. GPPO occurs when a company member has a psychological sense of ownership for the company’s green products, treats the products as subject matter, generates positive attitudes and thoughts, and is willing to engage in off-role behavior and take risks for this behavior such as dedication and sacrifice [ 35 ]. Therefore, for companies that are moving toward sustainable development, the degree of GPPO affects employees’ behavior, attitudes, and organizational green management performance. Furthermore, when a company employee has strong GPPO, they would exhibit a positive attitude and positive ideas, be willing to take risks for the company, and make additional efforts and sacrifices [35].

# 2.3.1. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

Personal PO in organizations mainly originates from the four motivations of human needs: (1) Efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation. Of these motivations, stimulation needs are incentives for PO. Efficacy and effectance indicate that individuals can successfully

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

exercise control and appear to have a sense of ownership, which is used as a source of attaining satisfaction. Self-Identity represents the personal experience of biasing the subject matter, and as a part of self-extension, the most important thing is to own. Such holdings symbolize a kind of identity and are interpreted by others. Having a place refers to the need for personal space, which motivates individuals to control their surroundings and invest in them. Stimulation drives individuals to use, care about, and maintain objects. Thus, people are motivated to achieve stimulating needs and meet awakening requirements [58–61].

Many factors influence the formation of PO. These factors influence not only the formation of PO and work characteristics but also the company culture, attitude of high-level managers, company’s goals and vision, and reputation of the company [62]. A common vision conveys an organization’s members’ common goals and ambitions for the organization [29, 63]. Moreover, it represents the organization’s vision, mission, and core values [64, 65]. Thus, when a company promotes sustainable development and formulates a GSV, this expresses to employees the goal and value of their efforts and strengthens their personal ownership and PO of the target green product. Chiu et al. [62] proposed that a company’s goals and vision affect PO. Moreover, according to Chang [35], GSV contributes to GPPO. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3 (H3).

GSV is positively associated with GPPO.

# 2.3.2. Effect of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC) and Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

PO affects individuals’ attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Furthermore, PO causes a person to exhibit a stance, sense of responsibility, and self-concept beyond the norms [66]. When an organization’s members have PO for their organization, they tend to exhibit more responsibility for their roles, take greater care of the organization, and adopt a protective attitude toward the organization [67]. Moreover, they may be willing to take risks or make personal sacrifices for the organization [59] and the subject matter of PO [59]. When members of an organization have PO for a certain subject matter, they may exhibit positive attitudes toward the organization [68]. Research has indicated that PO is an important predictor of the status of members of organizations [56, 58, 66, 69, 70]. Studies have indicated that factors such as the work performance and satisfaction of work can be predicted by organization-based PO [58, 59, 71, 72].

The PO of green products can predict individuals’ organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35]. When PO is assigned to a certain subject matter, employees tend to regard it as a social entity, be psychologically related to it, be willing to take risks for it, and generate positive attitudes and behaviors toward it. In general, according to PO theory, GPPO refers to the PO generated by employees of a company for its green products when they regard the products as a subject matter. GPPO enables a company’s employees to exhibit positive attitudes and behaviors, and this contributes to organizational performance and encourages employees to actively search for information regarding company products, services, and related environmental policies that they did not understand initially. To maintain GPPO, employees become more willing to follow relevant environmental regulations and practices. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:

# Hypothesis 4 (H4).

GPPO is negatively associated with EGC.

# Hypothesis 5 (H5).

GPPO is positively associated with EEP.

# 2.3.3. Mediating Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

PO differs according to the motivation for possession. The feeling of possession is ubiquitous. Possession can be a tangible goal, an intangible goal, or a statutory but not legal form of ownership [73].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

When the inner and psychological feelings possessed by an individual are integrated, and the members of the organization will be based on human instinct motivation, they may feel such ownership due to various factors in the organization and practice to further satisfy. In particular, when the target slowly becomes a part of the owner’s psychological identification, PO is generated [58].

According to PO theory, an individual’s PO of a certain subject matter originates from four demand motivations that include (1) efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation [58 –61]. The psychological history of PO as well as the personal positive behaviors and attitudes are based on interpretations of the subject of PO. According to the theoretical perspective of expectation motivation, an individual’s positive performance and contribution are related to the desire to meet expectations [48, 49]. Consequently, when the underlying motivation of an individual’s PO meets the expected value, the individual would exhibit a highly positive behavior and attitude. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:

# Hypothesis 6a (H6a).

The relationship between the exposure to EGC and GSV is mediated by GPPO.

# Hypothesis 6b (H6b).

The relationship between the exposure to EEP and GSV is mediated by GPPO.

# 2.4. Negative Effects of Employee Green Confusion (EGC) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

Companies are facing considerable pressure from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, business partners, and environmental organizations, to focus their policies on the environment [74] and develop, produce, and sell environmentally friendly products. Companies intending to achieve the goal of sustainable development may do well to formulate a GSV to promote all aspects of relevant environmental protection measures to create a green image of themselves [75 – 79]. Employees may experience information overload when an enterprise manager releases excessive information regarding the enterprise’s environmental regulations, products, or services to quickly respond to requests from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, environmental organizations, and governments.

Mitchell, Walsh, and Yamin [32] indicated that people exhibit different levels of information cognition and digestion when they process information. When the amount of information increases, the likelihood of information overload also increases. The release of a large amount of information can cause confusion among employees [32, 33] as well as make it difficult for employees to focus on the relevant environmental regulations promoted by the company and to interactively exchange environmental knowledge with relevant stakeholders. The aforementioned phenomenon of employee confusion is called EGC. When EGC occurs, employees’ interactions with their organization’s relevant norms and stakeholders are affected. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 7 (H7).

EGC is negatively associated with EEP.

The research framework is illustrated in Figure 2.

# Employee Green Confusion (EGC)

# Green Shared Vision (GSV)

# Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

# Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

# 3. Methodology and Measurement

# 3.1. Data Collection and Sample

To verify the aforementioned hypotheses in the Taiwan production industry, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The study participants were staff members who worked in the information services, electronics, components manufacturing, computer and peripheral products, health care and biotech, communication equipment manufacturing, electronic products and components, equipment and machinery manufacturing, and software industries in Taiwan. The questionnaire survey sample was randomly selected from the “Business Directory of Taiwan.” The participants were leaders or managers of the manufacturing, research and development, environment, or marketing departments or members of environmental product development projects. To ensure a high degree of content validity in this research, two rounds of pretests were conducted.

Respondents from different industries and sectors were recruited in this study because such recruitment reduces common method variance problems. To effectively improve the response rate, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire, before the questionnaire was issued, we contacted the relevant companies by phone to determine whether they provided green products or related services and confirmed whether green products were their primary revenue source. We provided gifts to the respondents after they filled the questionnaire. On the first page of the questionnaire, the research objectives were explained, and informed consent was requested from the participants. The participants were then informed that the green products or related services provided by their company were the evaluation targets of the company’s GSV, EGC, EEP, and GPPO. We issued 750 formal questionnaires and obtained 475 valid questionnaires. Thus, the effective response rate was 63.33%. In this study, in order to effectively reduce the possible factors that MacKenzie and Podsakoff [80] pointed out that are likely to cause CMV, we can hide the respondent information, the design purpose of the item, and randomly sort the items when designing the questionnaire. Furthermore, as suggested by Cacioppo and Petty [81], the semantics and words used in the design of the questionnaire are closer to the background of respondents. This can improve the entire questionnaire design, and we can survey people in different industries or units. Afterwards, the CMV test was conducted through Harman’s one-factor test. The result indicated that the load of the first factor was 28.319%, which met the standard value below 50%. As a result, there was no serious CMV problem.

# 3.2. Measurements

This research framework questionnaire contains four measurement dimensions (the scale presented in Appendix A), including GSV [25], GPPO [35], EGC [18,82], and EEP [46], using a 7-point Likert scale. While this research questionnaire refers to the scale developed by related scholars, there may still be research biases. This research is further verified through exploratory factor analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal rotation with varimax. The verification result shows that Bartlett’s test of sphericity and the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value all as stated by standard value [83] is suitable for exploratory factor analysis, with 17 items and 4 components. The component names are the same as the original construct, namely GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP (Table 1). Nunnally and Bernstein [84] suggested that the standard value of correlation coefficient (Cronbach’s α) should be more than 0.7 and each aspect meets the standard value. Consequently, the questionnaire of this research has good reliability.

The standard deviations, means, and positive correlations of the constructs considered in this study are presented in Table 2. EGC was significantly negatively correlated with GSV, GPPO, and EEP, whereas the other constructs were significantly positively correlated.

The loadings (λ) of all the items of the four constructs are presented in Table 3. All the loadings were significant and exhibited suitable values in the measurement mode. The Cronbach’s α can be used as an index for determining the reliability (the standard value is 0.7) [85]. We verified the Cronbach’s α values according to the recommendations of researchers such as Williams and Hazer [86] and Anderson and Gerbing [87]. The Cronbach’s α values of all the constructs were more than 0.7, as presented in Table 4. Therefore, the measurement reliability is consistent with an acceptable standard value.

According to Fornell and Larcker [88], when the square root of the average variation extracted (AVE) of the facet is greater than the correlation coefficient of the model facet, it means that each variable has discriminative validity, as shown in Table 2. The AVE square roots of the models GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP in this study are greater than the correlation coefficient of all the constructs. Thus, sufficient discriminant validity existed between any two constructs in this research.

|---|---|---|---|

Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt [89] pointed out that the effect of the original Fornell and Larcker [88] discriminant validity test may be overestimated. Hence, this study further uses average heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) to calculate the correlation ratio between the four facets of EEP, EGC, GSV, and GPPO. The overall result shows that it meets the standard value (all less than 0.85), so this study has good discriminative validity (see Table 4). A construct’s convergent validity is acceptable if its AVE is greater than 0.5. The AVEs of GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP were 0.688, 0.726, 0.736, and 0.628, respectively, which are greater than 0.5. Thus, the constructs considered in this study had suitable convergent validity. Besides, Bagozzi and Yi [90] pointed out that the R-square of the observation variable is >0.5, which means that each observation variable is suitable for measuring each potential variable (Table 3). The aforementioned results indicated that the measurements in this study had acceptable validity and reliability.

# 4.2. Structural Model Results

The analysis of moment structure and structural equation modeling were performed to test the research hypotheses. The structural modeling results are presented in Figure 3. According to the results, the full model had an acceptable fit (NFI = 0.951, CFI = 0.968, GFI = 0.928, and RMSEA = 0.061). GSV exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.504), EEP (p &lt; 0.01, standardized direct effect = 0.148; Figure 3), and GPPO (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.426). GPPO exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.37) and EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.452). Moreover, EGC exhibited a direct effect on EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.307). The study results indicated that H1, H3, H4, H5, and H7 were supported. Thus, GSV has a direct and positive effect on GPPO, EGC, and EEP. GPPO has a direct and significant relationship with EGC and EEP, and EGC has a direct effect on EEP. According to Baron and Kenny [91], who verified the mediating effects, GPPO partially mediates the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP.

Figure 3. Full model results.

To ensure preciseness, we performed a percentile bootstrap procedure and a deviation correction percentile bootstrap procedure 5000 times with a 95% confidence interval to examine two mediating models [92]. According to the advice of Preacher and Hayes [93], we calculated the confidence interval of the upper and lower bounds to verify whether the indirect effects were significant. The bootstrap test results presented in Table 5 indicated that GPPO partially mediated the relationship between GSV and EGC (standard indirect effect = −0.145, Z = 4.394, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval) and between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.141, Z = 4.7, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval). Thus, hypotheses 6a and 6b were confirmed. After exploring the indirect effects of the variables of the structural model, we further examined the obtained data and found two unexpected intermediary relationships: (1) the mediation effect of EGC on the relationship between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.113, Z = 2.216, Z &gt; 1.96; 0 is not included in the 95% confidence interval) and (2) the distal mediation effects: GSV and EEP via GPPO and EGC (standard indirect effect = 0.145, Z = 1.986, Z &gt; 1.96; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval).

# 5. Conclusions and Implications

In this study, we investigated Taiwanese companies that engage in environmental protection. We examined the effect of psychological processes related to green issues on employees’ green management performance. This study verified the relationships among GSV, EEP, GPPO, and EGC through PO theory and expectancy–valence theory. By investigating GSV and the PO of green products, we came to understand the effect of psychological processes related to green issues. Green management performance is enhanced by reducing EGC and improving EEP.

The study results indicate the existence of associations in the concept of integration. For example, the psychological processes related to green issues affect EGC and EEP. In addition, this study indicates that the antecedents of PO strengthen the PO effect as well as the behaviors and attitudes of the parties. The combined insights obtained from PO theory and expected value theory can contribute to sustainable environmental development. The results indicate that GSV has a significant negative correlation with EGC and a significant positive correlation with EEP. Thus, developing a GSV for an enterprise is an important strategy for the enterprise to achieve sustainable development. GSV can strengthen the PO.

of company members; encourage them to work harder to achieve the organization goals; minimize their doubts regarding the environmental policies, specifications, products, and other related information of the company; and improve their environmental performance. To achieve corporate sustainability, a company must strengthen its members’ GPPO and formulate a clear corporate GSV. The findings of this study have several theoretical implications.

# 5.1. Theoretical Implications

Our research provides three academic contributions to the sustainable development of green management in the field of psychology. First, the empirical results verified the hypothesis that expectancy–valence theory incorporates PO. When results meet people’s expectations, they receive additional investment and compensation, strengthening the PO’s degree [49, 94]. The aforementioned contribution expands the original expected value theory to fields such as topic teaching and learning for young children [94–97], unemployment issues [47, 98], and physical and mental health issues [99], which enables research gaps in the field of business management to be filled. Moreover, few studies have examined confusion issues from the perspective of employees. Therefore, this study used the views of PO theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV to fill an existing research gap. Second, the empirical results of the past GSV research literature found that GSV contributes to employee’s proenvironmental behavior [100], green product development performance [34, 101, 102], and organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35], especially focusing on employee behavior and product development performance. Finally, the study results indicate the effect of psychological process related to green issues on green management performance in an integrated conceptual framework. The expectation value theory and PO theory indicate that relationships exist among GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP. This finding expands the contribution of psychology to sustainable environmental development. This study also verified PO theory by examining the mediation effects of EGC and EEP on the relationship between GPPO and GSV. The results indicated that GSV enhances the degree of PO and positively affects GPPO. The research model expands the PO model and indicates that GSV is crucial for the formation of PO, reduces a company’s EGC, and improves a company’s EEP. Thus, GPPO is critical for corporate sustainability [35, 103].

# 5.2. Practical Implications

The research findings can help Taiwanese companies promote environmental sustainability. These findings also provide a reference to other Asian companies seeking to perform green management. The research results indicate that a relationship exists between GSV and GPPO in psychological processes related to green issues. Moreover, the results indicate that an organization’s green management performance is affected by its EGC and EEP. This study indicates that EGC and EEP are caused by GSV and GPPO. GSV is positively correlated with EEP, GPPO is negatively correlated with EGC and positively correlated with EEP, and EGC is negatively correlated with EEP. The aforementioned results indicate that psychological processes related to green issues improve an organization’s green management performance. We found that employees’ EEP is affected by their EGC. Therefore, this study proposes several steps for corporate management to reduce EGC and promote EEP. First, the head of the enterprise management class should formulate a GSV, express the goals and aspirations of the company’s sustainable development, and regularly discuss and reflect on the amendments to the GSV. The development of a shared vision for the organization would improve organizational performance and motivate members to work toward organizational goal [29, 42, 63, 104, 105]. Thus, companies should use psychological processes related to green issues for verifying the execution results and adopt an active GSV strategy to create employee GPPO in their business models. By using the aforementioned strategy, companies can reduce employees’ EGC and improve their EEP. In particular, companies should formulate an environmental development blueprint and develop incentive plans to encourage their employees to participate in the design and production of environmental products. A good practice is for employees to participate in the production process of environmentally friendly.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

# 5.3. Limitations and Future Research

This study has certain limitations. First, the data analysis results unexpectedly revealed that EGC has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between GSV and EEP. The findings of this study provide preliminary concepts that should be verified using relevant studies. Second, this study analyzes the perspectives of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory and discusses the environmental behavior and performance of organizational employees. Future research can go further and use other theories. For example, the value theory can further strengthen the relationship between Psychological Processes of Green Issues and Green Management Performance through the exploration of Costs and benefits or the expectancy theory. Third, all the research participants were from Taiwan. The universality of the study results may be limited by differences in the national conditions, cultures, industrial scenarios, and economic structures between different countries. Therefore, the results of this study can be verified by conducting research in other countries and regions, such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Finally, from the perspective of the company’s internal green management strategy, this study verifies that the psychological processes of company members related to green issues affect their GSV and GPPO. We also analyzed members’ environmental behavior and performance as well as excluding other behaviors and organizational characteristics that may disturb employees. In future research, we will be able to further explore the perceived organization’s support to the environment and the organization’s impact on the environment’s citizenship behavior [46]. Or, according to Chen, Chang, and Lin [24], starting from the green absorptive capacity of employees, further discuss the issues and determinants that affect employees’ environmental behavior and performance.

# 5.4. Conclusions

According to expectancy–valence theory, the psychological process related to green issues affect the background factors controlling the influence of GSV on company members. This study combined insights from PO theory and expectancy–valence theory and presented a psychological process structure. Due to the research gap related to the association between GSV and green management scope, this paper presents a framework that emphasizes how GSV affects the relationship between EGC and EEP through GPPO in the current environmental era. This research explored an extramental mechanism that illustrated the connection between GPPO and relevant variables. The research model indicates that EGC and EEP are affected by the exposure to GSV through an increase in GPPO. A Taiwanese employee sample was used to support the proposed hypotheses. This study provides many important

implications for guiding managers and decision-making authorities. According to the integrated model of the psychological process of green issues in this study, the assumptions of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory indicate the psychological process of employees’ motivation and psychological ownership. The overall process of an enterprise to effectively strengthen employees’ mentality of green issues is an important key to improving the organization’s green management performance. In the process of improving EEP, companies must not only strengthen the psychological process of employees’ green issues, but reducing EGC is also an important key. Effectively reducing EGC can enable employees to devote themselves to work and contribute to EEP. Therefore, companies should upgrade their GSV to enhance their employees’ GPPO and EEP and decrease their employees’ EGC to achieve corporate sustainability goals.

# Do investors care about carbon risk?

# Patrick Bolton, Marcin Kacperczyk

# ABSTRACT

We study whether carbon emissions affect the cross-section of US stock returns. We find that stocks of firms with higher total carbon dioxide emissions (and changes in emissions) earn higher returns, controlling for size, book-to-market, and other return predictors. We cannot explain this carbon premium through differences in unexpected profitability or other known risk factors. We also find that institutional investors implement exclusionary screening based on direct emission intensity (the ratio of total emissions to sales) in a few salient industries. Overall, our results are consistent with an interpretation that investors are already demanding compensation for their exposure to carbon emission risk.

# 1. Introduction

Many studies seek to explain the cross-sectional pattern of stock returns based on exposures to aggregate risk factors such as size and book-to-market ratios, or firm-specific risk linked to observable firm characteristics. One variable that has so far been missing from the analysis is corporate carbon emissions. This omission may be for historical reasons, as concerns over global warming linked to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from human activity have only recently become salient. But, both the evidence

of rising temperatures and the renewed policy efforts to curb CO2 emissions raise the question of whether carbon emissions represent a material risk for investors that is reflected in the cross-section of stock returns and portfolio holdings.

Two major developments, in particular, suggest that this may be the case. First, the Paris COP 21 climate agreement of December 2015, with 195 signatories committing to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Second, the rising engagement of the finance industry with climate change, largely as a result of the call to non-governmental actors to join the fight against climate change at the COP 21. Institutional investors are increasingly tracking the greenhouse gas emissions of listed firms and forming coalitions such as Climate Action 100+ to engage with companies to reduce their carbon emissions.1 More and more asset owners are following the lead of the Church of England Pension Fund, whose stated goal is “to demonstrate transparently that it has delivered on its commitment to be aligned to the Paris Agreement.”2

Even if the US has pulled out of the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration, and even if the commitments of the other remaining signatories are only partially credible, major curbs in CO2 emissions are likely to be introduced over the next decade. Primarily affected by these curbs are the companies with operations generating high CO2 emissions, or with activities linked to companies in the value chain that have high CO2 emissions. In light of these developments, one would expect to see the risk with respect to carbon emissions to be reflected in the cross-section of stock returns. Yet, considerable skepticism remains, not least in the US where the Trump administration had worked to upend regulations that limit CO2 emissions. For example, Darren Woods, ExxonMobil’s CEO, recently declared that “Individual companies setting targets and then selling assets to another company so that their portfolio has a different carbon intensity has not solved the problem for the world.” And that ExxonMobil was “taking steps to solve the problem for society as a whole and not try and get into a beauty competition.”3

The lack of consensus among institutional investors around climate change naturally raises the possibility that carbon risk may not yet be reflected in asset prices. To find out, in this paper we systematically explore whether investors demand a carbon risk premium by looking at how stock returns vary with CO2 emissions across firms and industries. We undertake a standard cross-sectional analysis, asking whether carbon emissions affect cross-sectional US stock returns.

There are several ways in which one might expect CO2 emissions to affect stock returns. First, since CO2 emissions are tied to fossil-fuel energy use, returns are affected by fossil-fuel energy prices and commodity price risk. Relatedly, firms with disproportionately high CO2 emissions may be exposed to carbon pricing risk and other regulatory interventions to limit emissions. The firms that are most reliant on fossil energy are also more exposed to technology risk from lower-cost renewable energy. Forward-looking investors may seek compensation for holding the stocks of disproportionately high CO2 emitters and the associated higher carbon risk they expose themselves to, giving rise to a positive relation in the cross-section between a firm’s own CO2 emissions and its stock returns. We refer to this as the carbon risk premium hypothesis.

An interesting question is whether carbon emissions are perceived to be a systematic risk factor and whether the carbon risk premium is tied to loadings on this risk factor. Carbon emissions could be a systematic risk factor if expected regulatory interventions to curb emissions apply uniformly to all emissions. For example, if a large federal carbon tax were to be introduced, this would be a systematic shock affecting all companies with significant emissions. Alternatively, most regulatory interventions could be introduced in a piecemeal way at the state, industry, and municipal level. Similarly, technological improvements in the use of renewable energy could be mostly targeted to particular operations or sectors. In this case, one would not expect carbon emissions to be a systematic risk factor.

3 Quoted in Exxon CEO Calls Rivals’ Climate Targets a ‘Beauty Competition’ by Kevin Crowley, Bloomberg News, March 5, 2020, https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/exxon-ceo-calls-rivals-climate-targets-a-beauty-competition-1.1400957.

A second hypothesis is that financial markets are pricing carbon risk inefficiently and the risk associated with carbon emissions is underpriced. Carbon risk may not be fully integrated by most investors, who by force or habit look at future cash-flow projections through local thinking à la Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010), ignoring unrepresentative information about global warming and its attendant risks. To be sure, the cash-flow scenarios commonly used by financial analysts do not directly refer to carbon emissions and their possible future repricing. A recent study by In, Park, and Monk (2019) on a different sample than ours finds that a portfolio that is long stocks of companies with low carbon emissions and short stocks of companies with high emissions generates positive abnormal returns. We refer to this hypothesis as the market inefficiency, or carbon alpha, hypothesis. An important question we explore is whether financial markets underprice carbon risk (after controlling for other known risk factors, industry, and firm characteristics) to the point that responsible investors, who care about carbon emissions and climate change, could be “doing well by doing good.”

A third hypothesis is that the stocks of firms with high emissions are like other “sin stocks”; they are shunned by socially responsible, or ethical, investors to such an extent that the spurned firms present higher stock returns. A key question in this respect is how investors identify the firms to be divested from. Do they look at carbon emissions at the firm level, or do they pigeonhole firms into broader categories such as the industry they operate in? Even socially responsible investors that care about climate change may use sparse models (à la Gabaix, 2014) and not look much beyond industry categorizations, such as the energy and electric utility sectors, which produce a disproportionate share of CO2 emissions. Prominent divestors like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, for example, who have pledged to divest from fossil fuel companies, largely focus on energy companies that extract coal and oil from tar sands. We refer to this as the divestment hypothesis.

A pioneer in producing company-level CO2 emissions data is the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). It has been joined by other leading providers of carbon data, including MSCI ESG Research and Trucost, among others. While more and more institutional investors make use of the data, it is not known how much individual companies’ stock returns are actually affected by the availability of these more granular CO2 emissions data to financial analysts. Our study relies on the Trucost EDX data, which cover around 1,000 listed companies since fiscal year 2005, and over 2,900 listed companies in the US since fiscal year 2016. We match these data with the FactSet returns and balance sheet data for all US-listed companies from 2005 to 2017.

Carbon emissions from a company’s operations and economic activity are typically grouped into three different categories: direct emissions from production (scope 1), indirect emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam (scope 2), and other indirect emissions from the production of purchased materials, product use, waste disposal, outsourced activities, etc. (scope 3). The scope 3 category in turn is separated into upstream and downstream indirect emissions. The data on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are widely reported. Scope 3 emissions on the other hand are estimated using an input-output matrix. Although scope 3 emissions are the most important component of companies’ emissions in a number of industries (e.g., automobile manufacturing), they have not been reported by companies until recently.

Our main broad finding is that carbon emissions significantly affect stock returns. For all three categories of emissions, we find a positive and statistically significant effect on firms’ stock returns. We designate the higher returns associated with higher emissions as a carbon premium. We estimate how this carbon premium is related to three different measures of corporate emissions: 1) the total level of emissions; 2) the year-by-year change in emissions; and 3) emission intensity, which measures carbon emissions per unit of sales. A striking result is that the carbon premium is related to the level of (and to changes in) emissions, but not to emission intensity. One reason why the premium is tied to total emissions is that regulations limiting emissions are more likely to target activities where the level of emissions is highest. For example, in its planned climate stress test, the Bank of England focuses only on large firms and measures risk in terms of required reductions in the level of emissions.

(see the 2021 biennial exploratory scenario on the financial risks from climate change (Bank of England discussion paper, 2019)). Similarly, since technological change generally involves a fixed cost, renewable energy is more likely to displace fossil fuels in firms where returns to scale are highest. Another consideration is that since emission intensity is a ratio, it is likely to be a noisier metric of carbon risk exposure. Two firms with identical emission intensities may vary substantially in their levels of emissions. Indeed, this is what we find: the correlation coefficient between the level of scope 1 emissions and emission intensity is 0.6, and significantly less for scope 2 and scope 3. Nevertheless, it is somewhat surprising that we find no premium associated with emission intensity since emission-intensive firms might well be the first to become unprofitable should the carbon price rise. Investors would then demand a premium for holding these firms.

Interestingly, there is also a significant carbon premium associated with the year-to-year growth in emissions. As one would expect, we find that the level of emissions is highly persistent. Hence, emission levels reflect a long-run risk exposure with respect to carbon emissions. Changes in emissions, in turn, reflect short-run effects; how much worse, or better, carbon risk gets. Of course, changes in emissions could also indicate changes in earnings, but we control for this effect by adding the company’s return on equity, sales growth, and earnings growth, among our independent variables.

The carbon premium is economically significant: A one-standard-deviation increase in respectively the level and change of scope 1 emissions leads to a 15-bps and 26-bps increase in stock returns, or respectively a 1.8% and 3.1% annualized increase. In addition, a one-standard-deviation increase in the level and change of scope 2 emissions leads to respectively a 24-bps and 18-bps increase in stock returns, or a 2.9% and 2.2% annualized increase. Finally, a corresponding one-standard-deviation increase in the level and change of scope 3 emissions increases stock returns by 33 bps and 31 bps per month, or 4.0% and 3.8% on an annual basis. Importantly, firms with higher emissions generate higher returns, after controlling for size, book-to-market, momentum, other well-recognized variables that predict returns, and firm characteristics, such as the value of property, plant & equipment (PPE), and investment over assets.

Other things equal, a carbon premium is the reflection of a lower investor demand for stocks of companies associated with high emissions. In equilibrium, this lower demand translates into a lower stock price, and possibly also lower holdings of high-emission stocks by some categories of investors. Following Hong and Kacperczyk (2009), we explore to what extent companies with high carbon emissions are treated like “sin stocks” by institutional investors. We find that, in aggregate, institutional investors do hold a significantly smaller fraction of companies with high scope 1 emission intensity, but they are not underweight companies with high levels of emissions. When we disaggregate by investor categories (mutual funds, insurance companies, banks, pension funds, and hedge funds), we find that insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds are underweight scope 1 emission intensity. The negative ownership effect of moving from high to low scope 1 emission-intensity firms is economically large and accounts for about 15%-20% of the cross-sectional variation in the ownership variable. This finding is in line with the rise in the sustainable investment movement and the popular negative exclusionary screening investment strategy followed by funds with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) tilt.

We find that divestment is only based on scope 1 emission intensity. This is true both in aggregate and for each institutional investor category. Essentially, institutional investors have been applying exclusionary screens (or not) solely on the basis of scope 1 emission intensity. Even more remarkable, we find that when we exclude the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil & gas, utilities, and motor industries), there is no significant exclusionary screening at all by institutional investors. In other words, the exclusionary screening is done entirely in these salient industries; in all other industries, there is no significant divestment. Overall, these findings lead us to reject the divestment hypothesis. First, although there is significant divestment by institutional investors, it is not directly linked to an effect on stock returns. Institutional investor portfolios are significantly underweight firms with high scope 1 emission intensity, but stock returns are not affected significantly by emission intensity.

See Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020). Also, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review 2018, negative/exclusionary screening is the largest sustainable investment strategy globally, representing $19.8 trillion of assets under management. http://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSIR_Review2018.3.28.pdf.

Our finding that stock returns are positively related to the level (and changes) of carbon emissions is largely consistent with the view that investors are pricing in a carbon risk premium at the firm level. This result contradicts the carbon alpha hypothesis, whereby investors holding a portfolio long stocks of companies with low carbon emissions and short stocks of companies with high emissions generates positive abnormal returns. Garvey, Iyer, and Nash (2018) and In, Park, and Monk (2019) suggest that portfolios that sort stocks by emission intensity (going long stocks with low intensity and short stocks with high intensity) generate a positive alpha. In contrast, we find that there is no significant effect of carbon intensity on stock returns. Our study differs in two important respects from theirs. First, we cover a different time period and sample of firms. Second, we control for industry, firm characteristics, and known risk factors, while neither of these studies includes all of these controls. Controlling for industry significantly affects the results. Also, in contrast to In, Park, and Monk (2019), we analyze the effects of carbon emissions for each scope category separately, thereby avoiding double counting.

Another important finding is that the carbon premium has only materialized recently. We show that if we look back to the 1990s by imputing the 2005 cross-sectional distribution of total emissions to the 1990s, there is no significant carbon premium, consistent with the view that investors at that time likely did not pay as much attention to carbon emissions. However, if we apply the same analysis to our sample period, by imputing the 2017 cross-sectional distribution of emissions back throughout our sample period, we find that there is a highly significant carbon premium.

To summarize, investors seem to take a somewhat schizophrenic attitude to carbon emissions. On the one hand, institutional investors clearly want to take a proactive approach by divesting from industries with high CO2 emissions. On the other hand, this categorical exclusionary screening approach only partially addresses the carbon risk issue. Indeed, investors price in a carbon emission risk premium at the firm level in all industries even though divestment is concentrated in the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil & gas, utilities, and transportation industries). If there is one general lesson that emerges from our analysis it is that carbon risk cannot just be reduced to a fossil fuel supply problem. It is also a demand problem. Once one factors in both the supply and demand aspects, all companies in all sectors are exposed to various degrees to carbon emissions risk. A coarse exclusionary approach focusing only on the energy and utility sectors misses the full extent of the problem investors face. Accounting for carbon risk is also required on the demand side, which inevitably involves the careful tracking of emissions at the firm level in all sectors.

Our study is related to a rapidly growing literature on climate change and financial markets. An early study by Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera‐Munoz (2014) of S&P 500 firms between 2006 and 2008 looks at the effects of direct carbon emissions on firm value, and the effects of voluntary public disclosure of emissions (through CDP) on firm value. They find that higher emissions are associated with lower firm values, but that voluntary disclosure mitigates the negative valuation effect of emissions. Relatedly, Chava (2014) looks at the effects of environmental concerns, as reflected in KLD ratings, on firms’ cost of capital. He finds that firms that derive substantial revenues from the sale of coal or oil, as reflected in a KLD rating, are associated with a higher implied cost of capital. In an extensive survey of institutional investors, Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020) also find that institutional investors believe that carbon emissions represent a material risk. Among their responses, institutional investors also say that they do not believe that there is substantial underpricing of carbon risk. Andersson, Bolton, and Samama (2016) propose a carbon risk hedging strategy for passive investors based on low carbon indexes.

More recently, Ilhan, Sautner, and Vilkov (2020) find that carbon emissions increase downside risk as reflected in out‐of‐the‐money put option prices. Hsu, Li, and Tsou (2019) look at the effects of environmental pollution on the cross-section of stock returns. They find that highly polluting firms are more exposed to environmental regulation risk and command higher average returns. Engle et al. (2020) construct an index of climate news through textual analysis of The Wall Street Journal and other media and show how a dynamic portfolio strategy can be implemented that hedges risk with respect to climate change news. Görgen et al. (2019) construct a carbon‐risk factor and estimate a carbon beta for firms. Monasterolo and De Angelis (2019) explore whether investors demand higher risk premia for carbon-intensive assets following the COP 21 agreement.

Other related studies explore the asset pricing consequences of greater material risks linked to climate events and global warming. Hong, Li, and Xu (2019) find that the rising drought risk caused by climate change is not efficiently priced by stock markets. Several studies examine climate change and real estate prices. Baldauf, Garlappi, and Yannelis (2020) find little evidence

of declining prices as a result of greater flood risk due to sea level rise. Bakkensen and Barrage (2017) find that climate risk beliefs in coastal areas are highly heterogeneous and that rising flood risk due to climate change is not fully reflected in coastal house prices. Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2019) find that coastal homes vulnerable to sea-level rise are priced at a 6.6% discount relative to similar homes at higher elevations. However, in a related study, Murfin and Spiegel (2020) find no evidence that sea level rise risk is reflected in residential real estate prices. Finally, Giglio et al. (2018) use real estate pricing data to infer long-run discount rates for valuing investments in climate change abatement.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and provide summary statistics. We discuss the results in Section 3. Concluding remarks are in Section 4.

# 2. Data and Sample

Our primary database covers the 2005-2017 period and is largely a result of matching two data sets by Trucost and FactSet in the US. Trucost provides information on corporate carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. FactSet provides data on stock returns, corporate fundamentals, and institutional ownership. We performed the matching using ISIN as a main identifier. In some instances, in which ISIN was not available to create a perfect match, we relied on matching based on company names (after standardizing the company names in FactSet and Trucost we match the names with a similarity score of one). Finally, when there are multiple subsidiaries of a given company, we used the primary location as a matching entity. The ultimate matching produced 3,421 unique companies out of 3,481 companies available in Trucost. Among the 60 companies we were not able to match, more than half are not exchange listed and the remaining ones are small. Hence, we believe our data cover almost the entire universe of companies with available emission data.

# 2.1. Data on corporate carbon emissions

Firm-level carbon emissions data are assembled by seven main providers: CDP, Trucost, MSCI, Sustainalytics, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, and ISS. All these providers follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol that sets the standards for measuring corporate emissions. More and more companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, and most large corporations report their emissions to CDP. Other providers rely on the CDP data and supplement it with other sources. Emissions can be measured directly at the source or more commonly by applying conversion factors to energy use. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol distinguishes between three different sources of emissions: scope 1 emissions, which cover direct emissions over one year from establishments that are owned or controlled by the company; these include all emissions from fossil fuel used in production. Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of purchased heat, steam, and electricity consumed by the company. Scope 3 emissions are caused by the operations and products of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. These include emissions from the production of purchased materials, product use, waste disposal, and outsourced activities.

In some sectors, like automobile manufacturing, by far the most important component of their emissions is the aggregation of all their scope 3 emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol distinguishes between 15 different categories of scope 3 emissions, including purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream & downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing & use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. According to CDP’s 2016 Climate Change Report, most scope 3 emissions are concentrated in two categories: purchased goods and services (around 44%) and use of sold products (around 48%). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol provides detailed guidance on how to identify a company’s most important sources of scope 3 emissions and how to calculate them.

See https://ghgprotocol.org.

See http://ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard.

See CDP 2016 Climate Change Report “Tracking Progress on Corporate Climate Action.”

Purchased goods and services, this basically involves measuring inputs, or “activity data,” and applying emission factors to these purchased inputs that convert activity data into emissions data. The upstream scope 3 data from Trucost that we use is constructed using an input-output model that provides the fraction of expenditures from one sector across all other sectors of the economy. This model is extended to include sector-level emission factors, so that an upstream scope 3 emissions estimate can be determined from each firm’s expenditures across all sectors from which it obtains its inputs (see Trucost, 2019). Downstream scope 3 emissions caused using sold products can also be estimated and are increasingly reported by companies. Trucost has recently started assembling this data, but we were not able to include it in our study.

Because they are easier to measure, and because disclosure requirements are stricter, data on scope 1 and scope 2 have been more systematically reported and accurately estimated. As Busch et al. (2018) show, there is very little variation in the reported scope 1 and 2 emissions data across the data providers. Correlations in the reported scope 1 (scope 2) data average 0.99 (0.98), across the five providers CDP, Trucost, MSCI, Sustainalytics, and Thomson Reuters. However, when it comes to estimated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (when reported data are missing), the correlations drop to 0.79 and 0.63, respectively for the three providers, Trucost, MSCI, and Sustainalytics, that offer these estimates. Finally, only two data providers, Trucost and ISS ESG, provide estimates of scope 3 emissions. The Trucost EDX database we use in our main analysis reports all three scopes of carbon emissions in units of tons of CO2 emitted in a year. We report the summary statistics of the emissions variables in Panel A of Table 1.

The average firm in our sample produces 1.97 million tons of scope 1 emissions, and is tied to 1.72 million tons of scope 3 emissions. The quantity of scope 2 emissions is relatively smaller, at 342,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. Notably, the median number is the largest for scope 3 emissions, as almost all companies in our sample are tied to a significant quantity of such emissions. The scope 1, 2, and 3 measures are in units of tons of CO2 and normalized using the natural log scale. We also report annual growth rates in each emission measure. To mitigate the impact of outliers, we winsorize all growth measures at the 2.5% level. The carbon intensity of a company is expressed as tons of CO2 equivalent divided by the company’s revenues in million US dollar units, also winsorized at the 2.5% level. The average (unwinsorized) scope 1 intensity in our sample equals 265.26 tons/million, while the intensities for scope 2 and scope 3 are 39.64 tons/million and 164.22 tons/million, respectively. The EDX database also provides information on whether the emissions data was reported or estimated, which allows us to do a sensitivity analysis and determine how the results are affected by the exclusion of the estimated data. We describe how the data breaks down into firms with reported and estimated emissions data in Table 2. As Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera‐Munoz (2014) note, firms that do not report their emissions are typically smaller (and therefore have smaller emissions) and are less profitable. But in other respects, firms that report their emissions have similar characteristics to those that do not. In particular, their stock returns, volatility, leverage, book-to-market ratios, capital expenditures, and betas are very similar.

We also report alternative measures Trucost provides, in particular: i) CARBON DIRECT, which adds three additional greenhouse gases to the GHG Protocol scope 1 measures; ii) CARBON INDIRECT, which covers a slightly broader set of emissions by the direct suppliers to a company than scope 2; iii) GHG DIRECT, measured in US dollars, which covers all direct external environmental impacts of a company. Trucost applies a monetary value to GHG emissions quantities, which represents the global average damage of each environmental impact; and iv) GHG INDIRECT, which covers indirect supply chain environmental impacts. These are estimated impacts based on Trucost’s environmental impact models. Again, these are reported in US dollars and represent the global average damages of each environmental impact.

How correlated are these different emission variables? We report the cross-correlations in Panel A of Table 3. As one would expect, the levels of all three categories of emissions are positively correlated. Yet, the coefficients are relatively small. Similarly, the level of scope 1 emissions is obviously positively correlated with scope 1 emission intensity, but the size of the coefficient is only 0.6, reflecting the fact that two firms with the same scope 1 intensity may have very different levels of emissions.

More than 6,300 companies worldwide answered CDP’s climate change questionnaire in 2018. Of these, 76% disclosed scope 1 emissions, 68% scope 2 emissions, and 38% scope 3 emissions (see https://www.cdp.net).

# 2.2. Variables in cross-sectional return regressions

A large firm, with high emissions, can have the same emission intensity as a small firm. The low correlation between levels and intensity is even more pronounced for scope 2 (0.24) and scope 3 (0.27). In Panel B, we also report the autocorrelation coefficients for the different measures of emissions. Emission levels for all three categories are highly persistent, with an autocorrelation coefficient of 0.977 for scope 1, 0.955 for scope 2, and 0.967 for scope 3. Interestingly, the year-to-year growth in emissions also has some persistence, especially for scope 3 emissions. As for the emission intensity variables they are, not surprisingly, also highly persistent as sales are highly persistent.

We also analyze the average values of all three emission sources over time. Fig. 1 and Table 4 present the results. As one might expect, there is a steady decline in scope 1 and scope 3 emissions at the firm level over time as a result of energy efficiency improvements, technological innovations, and an increase in the reliance on renewable energy sources. There is a sharp decline in scope 1 emissions from 2015 to 2016. However, this mainly reflects the addition by Trucost of many smaller firms to the sample in 2015, as can be seen in Fig. 2. The addition of all these firms to the sample also explains why total scope 3 emissions sharply increase from 2015 to 2016, and why total scope 1 emissions remain flat even though per-firm emissions decline. All these results are further confirmed by the numbers in Panels A and B of Table 4; averages for all firms in our sample are in Panel A while those conditioned on the presence in the sample prior to 2015 are in Panel B. We can see that when we drop the new firms added in 2016 from the sample, the averages for 2016 and 2017 are very close to the numbers in 2015. While we still observe some decline in scope 1 emissions, there is no such decline in scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. If anything, the numbers for scope 3 emissions go up, although not by much.

We note that firms with significant emissions are represented in a wide range of industries. In Table 5, we present the distribution of firms in our sample with respect to the six-digit Global Industry Classification (GIC 6). Banks, biotech, and oil & gas are the most represented industries, with each one having more than 150 firms.12 In Table 6, we provide a list of industries with the highest and the lowest intensity of emissions. Power, electric, and multi-utility industries produce the most scope 1 emissions, while consumer finance, thrifts and mortgages, and capital markets are the cleanest. The ranking is somewhat different when we classify industries with respect to their scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. Metals and mining, electric utilities, and construction materials are the three most scope 2 emission-intensive industries (the cleanest industries mimic those based on scope 1 classification). In turn, food products, metals and mining, and construction materials are the three most scope 3 emission-intensive industries. Internet software and services, health care technologies, and software are the three least emission-intensive industries. The Trucost industry classification is finer than the GIC six-digit classification. Given that we control for industry a natural question is how sensitive the results are to the classification itself. The classification in theory could be so fine that it includes only one firm in each industry or so coarse that it includes all firms in one industry. Adding industry fixed effects would be meaningless under these polar classification systems. As a robustness check, we also perform our analysis under the GIC classification and report the results in Table A.4 in the Appendix.

Finally, we observe not only substantial variation in the growth rates of emissions across different industries, but also significant variation in the rates of all three categories of emissions across firms within the same industry. Fig. 3 displays the time series plots of the average cross-sectional standard deviations of emission growth rates across all firms (Panel A) and across all firms within a given GIC 6 industry (Panel B). Even though the scale of the variation in Panel A is larger than that in Panel B, there is still a significant dispersion in emissions in Panel B. Moreover, the standard deviation in carbon emission growth rates is very stable over time. In particular, the standard deviation did not significantly change following the addition of new firms to the sample in 2015.

12 Some firms in this table are classified into multiple industries; hence, the total number of firms in the table (3917) exceeds the number of unique firms in our sample (3421).

Our empirical analysis of stock returns employs a monthly measure of returns as a dependent variable. In our cross-sectional return regressions, the dependent variable RETi,t is the monthly return of an individual stock i in month t. Our return data primarily comes from FactSet, but for a small subset of delisted firms, we replace the return data with delisting-adjusted values from Compustat. Finally, we remove observations with returns greater than 100% to mitigate the impact of outliers. The number of excluded firm/month observations is 109 and its exclusion does not materially affect our results. However, using unrestricted returns data would be problematic as the data, for example, include four observations with monthly returns greater than 10,000%.

Our control variables are defined as follows: LOGSIZEi,t is the natural logarithm of firm i’s market capitalization (price times shares outstanding) at the end of year t; B/Mi,t is firm i’s book value divided by its market capitalization at the end of year t; LEVERAGE is the book leverage of the company; ROEi,t is the firm’s earnings performance, given by the ratio of firm i’s net yearly income divided by the value of its equity; MOMi,t is the average of the most recent 12 months’ returns on stock i, leading up to and including month t-1; INVEST/A represents the firm’s capital expenditures divided by the book value of its assets; HHI is the Herfindahl concentration index of firms with respect to different business segments, based on each segment’s revenues; LOGPPE is the natural logarithm of the firm’s property, plant, and equipment; BETAi,t is the market beta of firm i in year t, calculated over the one year period using daily data; VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of returns based on the past 12 months of monthly returns; SALESGRi,t is the dollar change in annual firm revenues normalized by last month’s market capitalization; EPSGRi,t is the dollar change in annual earnings per share, normalized by the firm’s equity price. To eliminate the impact of outliers, we winsorize B/M, LEVERAGE, and INVEST/A at the 2.5% level, and MOM, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR at the 0.5% level. We report the summary statistics of these variables in Panel B of Table 1.

The average firm’s monthly stock return is 1.14%, with a standard deviation of 10.84%. The average firm has a market capitalization of $13 billion, with a median value of $3.8 billion. The average book-to-market ratio is 0.50, while the average book leverage is 24%. The average market beta is 1.10, slightly more than that of the market.

# 2.3. Variables in the time series return regressions

The variables for our time series regressions are defined as follows: MKTRFt is the monthly return of the CRSP value-weighted portfolio in month t, net of the risk-free rate; SMB, HML, MOM, and CMAt are well-known portfolio return series downloaded from Ken French’s website: SMB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on small stocks and short on large stocks; HML is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high book-to-market stocks and short on low book-to-market stocks; MOM is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on past one-year return winners and short on past one-year return losers; CMA is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on conservative investment stocks and short on aggressive investment stocks. BAB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low-beta stocks and short on high-beta stocks; LIQ is the liquidity factor of Pastor and Stambaugh; NET ISSUANCE is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high-net-issuance stocks and short on low-net-issuance stocks. Net issuance for year t is the change in the natural log of split-adjusted shares outstanding from the fiscal yearend in t-2 to the fiscal yearend in t-1; IDIO VOL is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. We present the summary statistics for the various portfolio returns in Panel C of Table 1.

The average market risk premium in our sample is 0.7% per month. Other factors with relatively high risk premia are net issuance and BAB. Somewhat atypically, the value factor return in our sample is equal to 0%. Similarly, the momentum factor generates a mere 0.07% per month, and the volatility factor has a negative return of -0.18% per month.

# 2.4. Variables in divestment regressions

Our institutional ownership regression variables are: IOi,t, which is the fraction of the shares of company i held by institutions in the FactSet database at the end of year t. IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions.

at the end of the year, and then dividing this value by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year. We further decompose the institutional ownership with respect to subgroups of owners. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership by insurance companies; IO_INVESTCOS is the ownership by investment companies (e.g., mutual funds); IO_ADVISERS is the ownership by independent investment advisers; IO_PENSIONS is the ownership by pension funds and IO_HFS is the ownership by hedge funds. Even though the total institutional ownership captures the intensive margin only, the range of disaggregated ownership variables varies from 0% to 100% (as long as the total institutional ownership in the data has a positive value).

The control variables in the ownership regressions include PRINVi,t, which is the inverse of firm i’s share price at the end of year t; VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of monthly stock returns for firm i over the one-year period; VOLUMEi,t is the average daily trading volume (in $million) of stock i over the calendar year t. NASDAQi,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is listed on NASDAQ in year t, and zero otherwise; SP500i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is part of the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zero otherwise. We report the summary statistics for these variables in Panel D of Table 1.

The average IO is 0.77, and the cross-sectional standard deviation of IO is 0.22. In other words, in a typical year, a typical firm has about 77% of its shares held by institutional investors, and the standard deviation of institutional ownership in a typical cross-section is 22%. Among the different institutional owners, independent advisers are the biggest holders, with an average stock’s ownership equal to 43.9%, followed by investment companies with an average 18.2% ownership. Banks and insurance companies, in turn, are the smallest institutional owners. The average daily stock return volatility in our sample is 10% or annualized 158.7%. The average daily stock volume is $440,000. Finally, about 30% of stock-month observations are companies listed on NASDAQ, and 37% observations are firms from the S&P 500 Index.

# 3. Results

We begin our analysis by investigating the determinants of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions. We then turn to the evaluation of the carbon return premium in the cross-section of stocks. We next explore the time-series properties of the cross-sectional carbon premium with respect to well-known risk factors. Finally, we consider the divestment hypothesis by looking at institutional ownership patterns.

# 3.1. Determinants of carbon emissions

Since emissions are not reported by all companies, one basic issue to explore first is how companies that do report their emissions compare with non-reporting companies. To assess the quantitative differences on the extensive margin, we compare various firm-level characteristics for the reporting and non-reporting firms. We describe basic summary statistics of the two categories of firms in Table A.1 of the Appendix. As one might expect, we find that larger firms are more likely to report their emissions. Also, firms with lower book-to-market ratios and higher book leverage are more likely to report emissions. At the same time, the two groups of firms do not differ significantly in terms of their stock returns or investment levels.

Next, we assess the differences in emission levels, year-by-year changes, and emission intensities across firms using a regression framework. Our dependent variables are levels, changes, and intensities of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3. Since there is little theory that can guide us on what determines the level of carbon emissions, especially with regard to their different sources, we include a host of firm-level variables, comprising LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, SALESGR, and EPSGR. To reflect the possibility that firm-level emissions could concentrate across firms and over time, we cluster standard errors at the firm and year levels. Standard errors in all panel regressions become significantly smaller in alternative specifications that cluster at the firm, industry, time, or industry and time levels. We present the results in Table 7.

Not surprisingly, all three categories of emission levels, and changes in emissions, are significantly positively related to LOGSIZE. However, scope 1 and scope 3 emission intensities are weakly negatively related to LOGSIZE. The level of emissions is also significantly associated with high book-to-market ratios, high tangible capital (PPE), highly levered firms, and firms with high

# 3.2. Evidence on cross-sectional returns

For all three categories of emissions, we relate in turn the level of companies’ emissions, the year-to-year growth in emissions, and the companies’ emission intensity to their corresponding stock returns in the cross-section. We first estimate the following cross-sectional regression model using pooled OLS:

(1) where measures the stock return of company i in month t and Emissions is a generic term alternately standing for SCOPE 1, SCOPE 2, and SCOPE 3 emissions. The vector of controls includes a host of firm-specific variables known to predict returns, such as LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, MOM, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, BETA, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR. We also include year/month fixed effects. We cluster standard errors at the firm and year levels. Our coefficient of interest is.

We report the results in Table 8, Panel A. Column 1 shows the results for SCOPE 1; column 2 for SCOPE 2, and column 3 for SCOPE 3. For all three categories of emissions, we find a positive and statistically significant effect on firms’ stock returns. The effect is also economically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 1 leads to a 13-bps increase in stock returns, or 1.5% annualized, and a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 2 leads to a 23-bps increase in stock returns, or 2.8% annualized. Finally, a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 3 increases stock returns by 30 bps per month, or 3.6% annualized.

Since emissions tend to cluster significantly within specific industries, a question of interest is whether the firm-specific differences can be attributed to industry-specific effects. To examine this possibility, we additionally include industry-fixed effects using the Trucost industry classification. The results presented in columns 4 to 6 are quite striking. Including industry effects significantly strengthens the cross-sectional dispersion of returns due to carbon emissions. In fact, the economic significance increases by anywhere between 70% and 280% relative to the model without industry effects.

We also plot the time series of the cumulative values of the unadjusted and industry-adjusted carbon premia in Fig. 4. Because different emission variables have different supports, we express the magnitudes in terms of unit standard deviation of each variable at each cross-section in time, so that all plots of the cumulative effect show comparable numbers in terms of economic significance. As can be seen in the figure, there are large positive cumulative returns for all measures of total emissions. The economic magnitudes of the effect become even larger once we factor in differences in industry exposures.

We next estimate the same cross-sectional regression model (1) replacing the level of emissions (LOG (Emissions TOT)) with the year-to-year growth in emissions (Δ(Emissions)). The results are reported in Table 8, Panel B. We find again a positive and statistically significant effect of the growth in emissions on stock returns. Interestingly, controlling for industry makes almost no difference when it comes to the effect of the growth in emissions. To allay any concern that our results may be driven by the correlation between emissions and size, we provide additional robustness tests in which we estimate univariate regression models with respective emission variables only, and regressions with emissions and size only. The results, reported in Table A.2 of the Online Appendix indicate that size is an important control when one considers the level of total emissions as a regressor but it is not as important in the model with the growth rate of emissions. Note also that ROE has a significant positive effect on stock returns under this specification (it is insignificant in the specification with emission levels). We attribute this to the fact that firms HHI, SALESGR, and EPSGR are measured as of time t to reflect the fact that all three may have a nontrivial contemporaneous effect on the level of emissions at time t.

with high emission growth likely also have higher earnings, which could result in higher stock returns (to the extent that the higher earnings outcome is unanticipated).

We also plot the time series of the cumulative values of the unadjusted and industry-adjusted carbon premia related to the growth in emissions in Fig. 5. All measures of emissions exhibit a steady rate of increase in the carbon premium over time.

Finally, we estimate the cross-sectional regression model in (1) for emission intensities. We report the results in Table 8, Panel C. There is no significant effect of emission intensity on returns for any of the three categories of emissions, whether we control for industry or not. The cumulative effect of emission intensity on the carbon premium, presented in Fig. 6, is also quite weak, with the exception of scope 2 for which we observe a slightly positive trend. Overall, these results reveal that there is a significant carbon premium with respect to the level of emissions, reflecting firms’ long-run risk exposure to carbon emissions, and a premium with respect to the growth in emissions, which capture the more short-term evolution of firms’ risk exposure to future emissions.

One open question with our analysis above is that we use carbon emission data in year t to explain monthly returns over the same year t. This could conceivably introduce a look-ahead bias. That is, under this specification we might unwittingly relate stock returns for some months in year t to emission data that might not yet have been available to investors. To address this question, we undertake the following robustness check. We relate monthly stock returns with a lag of respectively 0 to 12 months between the time when emissions are reported and the month when returns are realized.

Another interpretation of the results with lagged returns is that investors have limited attention and do not immediately absorb new information about carbon emissions at the firm level (Kacperczyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp, 2016). In that case, carbon emissions for year t will be gradually reflected in returns over the year. An additional consideration is that investors obtain information about carbon emissions from multiple sources that are not all available at the same time. For example, a lot of firms disclose their emissions first to the CDP, data which then is merged into and combined with other sources by Trucost. Different information that is likely to be highly correlated with other information (given that all providers use the same data collection protocols) becomes available at different times. This is another reason why carbon emissions are only gradually reflected in stock returns.

We report the results in Table A.3. A remarkable pattern emerges from this analysis. Panel A1 reports the results for LOG (SCOPE 1 TOT). The coefficient is statistically significant for the first month (without industry fixed effects), remains significant at the 5% level until month 6 (with industry fixed effects), and is insignificant thereafter. Not surprisingly, it takes time for information about emissions to be reflected in stock prices, but eventually (after six months or so) this information appears to be fully absorbed. Essentially the same pattern is observed for the level of scope 2 and scope 3 emissions (with a somewhat faster (slower) integration of scope 2 (scope 3) emission information into stock prices), as the results in Panels A2 and A3 show. The same pattern is present for the growth in total emissions, as can be seen in panels B1, B2, and B3. However, emission intensity is nearly always insignificant, as we report in Panels C1, C2, and C3. The only visible exception is scope 1 emission intensity, which is significant at the 5% level in month 6 in the model with industry fixed effects. We conclude from this analysis that our results are not biased by a look-ahead effect.

Another possible explanation is that firms with higher emissions have also been exposed to unexpected positive value shocks. We explore this hypothesis by analyzing returns that strip out the effect of earnings surprises. Specifically, we subtract from the monthly stock returns the component that is realized on earnings announcement days and re-estimate the regression model in (1) with the adjusted returns. We report the results in Table 9 for the level of total emissions (Panel A), for the growth rate of emissions (Panel B), and for emission intensity (Panel C). We find no significant differential effect of earnings announcements on the carbon premium. Stocks with higher levels and growth rates of emissions still have higher returns, and emission intensity is still insignificant.

# 3.3. Carbon premium and risk factors

# Is the carbon premium linked to traditional risk factors?

To answer this question, we estimate the following time-series regression model using monthly data:

, (2)

where is the carbon return premium estimated from the cross-sectional Fama-MacBeth regression in Eq. (1); F is a set of factor-mimicking portfolios that includes MKTRF, HML, SMB, MOM, CMA, BAB, LIQ, NET ISSUANCE, and IDIO VOL. These factors have been widely used in many studies of asset prices. There are also economic reasons to believe that they could be meaningfully related to our carbon factor. Specifically, the first five factors correspond to the classic framework of Fama and French. In light of our results reported above, firm-level emissions are related to firm size and to firms’ growth opportunities; hence we include both the SMB and HML factors. The investment factor, CMA, controls for any differences in investments across firms. The market and momentum factors are standard controls in all time-series regressions. The BAB factor controls for the possibility that high carbon risk firms may be exposed to margin investments. The liquidity factor controls for possible differences in market liquidity among firms with different levels of carbon emissions, which could arise if some firms are not as actively traded as others due to ESG norm-based reasons. The net-issuance factor controls for any variation in capital structure and market timing by firm managers. Finally, the idiosyncratic volatility factor controls for the possibility that the measure of risk we capture may be idiosyncratic in nature. We calculate the standard errors of the coefficients using the Newey-West procedure with 12 lags to account for autocorrelation in error terms. Our coefficient of interest is , which measures the residual carbon premium, controlling for other risk/style factors.

# Panel A

Panel A in Table 10 shows the results for the carbon premium related to total emissions. In the odd columns, we report the unconditional carbon premium as a benchmark. In the even columns, we report results from regressions that add various factors MKTRF, HML, SMB, MOM, CMA, BAB, LIQ, NET ISSUANCE, and IDIO VOL. Comparing the odd and even columns for the respective scope categories of emissions, we find that the carbon premium remains statistically and economically significant after we adjust for differential factor exposures. However, the economic size of the premium is about 10%-20% smaller in magnitude. Overall, the regression intercepts from the cross-sectional return regressions are both economically and statistically significant in the presence of various risk factors.

# Panel B

Panel B shows the results for the carbon premium related to the growth rate in total emissions. We find again that the set of standard risk factors cannot explain the average value of the carbon premium for any of the emissions categories. This time, however, the difference in magnitudes across specifications is much smaller.

# Panel C

Panel C gives the results for emission intensity. Whether unconditionally or conditionally on the risk factors, we find no significant carbon premium.

Overall, our time-series regression results show that the carbon premium cannot be explained by known risk factors. This result reinforces the finding in Section 3.2 that the level of carbon emissions contains independent information about the cross-section of average returns.

# 3.4. The divestment hypothesis

An important possible explanation for the observed carbon premium could be under-diversification resulting from divestment and exclusionary screening of stocks with high carbon emissions by institutional investors implementing a sustainable investment policy. To the extent that some investors may shun companies with high carbon emissions, risk sharing would be limited, and idiosyncratic risk could be priced (e.g., Merton, 1987; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). If the extent of such divestment is high, one would expect to see significant pricing effects.

We test this possibility by looking at the portfolio holdings of institutional investors. Formally, we estimate the following pooled regression model:

. (3)

13

We consider ownership effects based on carbon intensity, the measure that is most aligned with explicit mandates imposed by socially sensitive asset managers. In the Online Appendix, Table A.4, we also present the results for the less commonly used measures of total emissions and growth in emissions. As these results confirm, these variables have no significant impact on institutional investor portfolios. The vector of controls includes LOGSIZE, PRINV, B/M, MOM, BETA, VOLAT, VOLUME, NASDAQ, and SP500. All regressions include year/month fixed effects. Also, carbon emissions tend to vary geographically, due to resource-driven firm locations. It is thus possible that the geographic location may also interact with ownership incentives. We test this idea by including in the ownership regression state fixed effects determined by the firm headquarters’ locations (in even columns). Our coefficient of interest is [missing value], which measures the degree of avoidance of firms with greater carbon emissions. We cluster standard errors at the industry and year levels.

# 3.5. Coarse Categorization

In Panel A of Table 11, we report the results for the aggregate institutional ownership measure. Columns 1 and 2 show the results for SCOPE 1 INT, respectively without and with state fixed effects. Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level. The economic effect of the divestment is relatively modest: a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 1 leads to approximately a 1.3-percentage-point decrease in aggregate institutional ownership, which is about 6.3% of the cross-sectional standard deviation in ownership. In contrast, the coefficients are statistically insignificant for SCOPE 2 INT and SCOPE 3 INT, indicating that the exclusionary screens institutional investors apply in constructing their portfolios are entirely based on SCOPE 1 INT.

The institutional investor world pools a number of different constituencies with possibly different investor pressures. We conjecture that certain institutions, such as insurance companies, investment advisers, or pension funds, are more likely to face investor pressure, and thus they avoid high-emission companies, as opposed to mutual funds and hedge funds who are natural arbitrageurs. We test this hypothesis formally by dividing the institutional investors’ universe into six categories: banks, insurance companies, investment companies, independent advisers, pension funds, and hedge funds. For each category, we obtain their stock-level institutional ownership and estimate the regression model in (3) for each of them separately. Panel B reports the results broken down by investor category. We observe a strong cross-sectional variation in the ownership patterns. Insurance companies, investment advisers, and pension funds tend to hold less of the high scope 1 emission companies. At the same time, we observe positive, though weaker, ownership effects for banks, investment companies, and hedge funds, consistent with these groups being natural arbitrageurs. The divestment effects are economically large. A movement in SCOPE 1 INT from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean, corresponding to a spread between low and high-emission firms leads to a reduction in ownership by 21%, 5%, and 4% of the cross-sectional standard deviation of ownership for investment advisers, insurance companies, and pension funds, respectively. In particular, given its large aggregate shares of stock holdings, the effect through investment advisers could lead to significant pricing effects. In sharp contrast to the results for SCOPE 1 INT, we observe that (with the exception of banks loading up positively on SCOPE 3 INT) all coefficients for the different investor types are small and statistically insignificant, which suggests that institutional investors do not seem to discriminate between stocks with regard to their scope 2 and scope 3 emission intensities.

Overall, institutional investors do significantly divest from firms associated with high SCOPE 1 INT. They do not screen companies based on the level of their emissions (or growth in emissions), even though the carbon premium is associated with these variables. They prefer to screen firms based on how efficiently they use fossil fuel energy and do not seem to be concerned about reducing their exposure to the level of carbon emissions per se. We conclude from these findings that, unlike for “sin” stocks (as shown by Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009), limited risk sharing caused by divestment cannot alone explain why we observe a return premium for companies with higher levels (and growth) of emissions.

It is often pointed out that only a handful of industries produce the most significant fraction of carbon emissions.14 The typical salient industries that are mentioned are oil & gas (GIC = 2), utilities (GIC = 65-69), and transportation (GIC = 19, 20, and 23). It is therefore natural to wonder whether our results are disproportionately driven by these sectors, and whether our cross-sectional carbon premium would become significantly smaller if we exclude these industries from our analysis.

In Table 12, we report the results for the subset of firms, excluding the sectors mentioned above. Panel A reports the results for total emissions, Panel B for the growth rate in emissions, and Panel C for emission intensity. Compared with the results in Table 8, we observe that, if anything, excluding these salient sectors strengthens the results on the firm-level carbon premium. These findings imply that there is a coarser categorization of companies by investors within the salient industries, where returns are less sensitive to differences in emissions across firms.

In Table 13, we report the results on institutional ownership when the salient high-CO2 industries are excluded. Consistent with Gabaix (2014), we find that coarse industry-level categorization drives our divestment results. Indeed, there is no significant divestment in the other industries. This is true in the aggregate as well as for the different categories of investors. It is as if investors decided to reduce their exposure to certain industries by divesting from some firms but holding on to the best in class in terms of scope 1 emission intensity in those industries. In Table A.5 of the Online Appendix, we provide additional evidence on this result with respect to levels and changes in emissions. We do not observe any divestment based on levels of emissions, but some divestment based on the growth of scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. This divestment is particularly strong for pension funds.

# 3.6. Investor awareness

The carbon premium in stock returns could also be affected by the changing awareness of investors about carbon risk. In particular, one would expect that periods with greater climate change awareness would have a higher carbon premium. We evaluate this hypothesis in two ways. First, we compare the estimated carbon premium before and after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Second, we impute carbon emissions in the 1990s based on their levels in 2005 and estimate the carbon premium over this decade and compare this premium to the one obtained over our sample period, when similarly imputing back carbon emissions based on the levels of emissions in 2017. Both tests offer complementary views on the role of changing investors’ attention. The first test allows us to assess the short-term impact of changing attention, while the second test is more suited for the long-term changes in attention.

The Paris Agreement possibly raised both the awareness of risks tied to carbon emissions and the prospect of regulatory interventions to limit carbon emissions. One could therefore expect that the carbon risk premium would increase after 2015 following the Paris Agreement. We test this hypothesis by estimating the regression model in (1) on the two sub-periods: 2005-2015, and 2016-2017.15 We report the results in Table 14. We find that indeed the premium associated with all three categories of emissions is larger during the 2016-2017 subperiod, especially for scope 1 and scope 2. This could be seen as evidence that investors care more about carbon risk following the Paris Agreement. However, an important caveat is that our sample increases after 2015, so that the difference in returns pre and post Paris could be attributed to the new firms that were added to our sample. We explore this possibility in the Online Appendix and indeed find in Table A.6 that the increase in return premium is mostly due to the addition of the new firms. We find that when we exclude the new firms, the carbon premium becomes insignificant in the two years following the Paris Agreement. The insignificance of the carbon premium does not necessarily mean that carbon risk is no longer priced after the Paris Agreement in 2015; it could be due to a weak statistical power given how noisy returns tend to be.

14 For instance, in a 2016 report, the International Energy Agency estimates that 39% of CO2 emissions come from electricity and heat production, 30% from transport, and 11% from industrial production (see https://www.iea.org/media/statistics/Energy_and_CO2_Emissions_in_the_OECD.pdf).

15 To enhance the statistical robustness of our results, we now cluster standard errors at the firm and year-month levels.

We further explore the cross-sectional variation of the effect of the Paris Agreement by examining whether the awareness that the Paris Agreement raised had a differential effect on the returns of firms with different exposures to carbon policy risk. We measure the exposures using our three measures of firm-level emissions. Our treatment sample is the subset of firms in the largest quartile of the distribution of firms sorted by the size of their carbon emission as of the end of 2014. We match these firms with a control group of firms with similar characteristics identified by two different techniques: the nearest neighbor and the Mahalanobis distance. The matching characteristics we use are the same as those we include in our return regressions. We report the results based on the nearest neighbor matching in Table 15. The results based on Mahalanobis matching are qualitatively similar.

To validate the quality of our matching, in Table A.7, we show, as an example, the balance test for the matched samples of treatment and control firms based on the scope 1 emission levels. We find that the two samples are not very different from each other along many firm-level dimensions. Notable exceptions are market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, return on equity, and property plant and equipment for which the differences are statistically significant, though not economically large. Importantly, the differences in market capitalization and PPE are expected given that the treatment sample is based on the size of firm emissions, which are strongly correlated with both characteristics. Next, we compare the returns of firms in the treatment and control groups in the one-year period around the Paris Agreement of December 2015. Formally, we estimate the following difference-in-differences regression model:

where TREAT is a generic indicator variable taking the value one for firms in the treatment sample and zero for firms in the control sample, and AFTER is an indicator variable equal to zero for the period 2015/05-2015/11 and equal to one for the period 2015/12-2016/05. We also include firm and year-month fixed effects in the regression. We estimate this model separately for each scope and emission measure. In the regressions, the sorts correspond to each scope measure, which then separately identify each individual treatment variable. Our coefficient of interest is e1, which measures the differential effect of the change on firms with high emissions and firms with low emissions.

In Panel A of Table A.7, we present the results for the level of total emissions. We find a strong and positive effect on returns based on scope 1 emissions, but no significant effects for the other two scopes of emissions. The effect is economically large, implying that the Paris Agreement resulted in an average increase in returns of more than 10.6% over the six-month period. In Panel B, we show the results based on changes in emissions. While the magnitudes of the results for scope 1 and scope 3 based on the model with industry fixed effects are fairly large (between 3.7% and 4.5%), they are statistically insignificant. In Panel C, we present the results based on carbon intensity. Surprisingly, we find a strong negative coefficient for scope 3 emissions. The effects for the other two scopes are small and insignificant. Overall, these results on the differential cross-sectional effects of the Paris Agreement are broadly consistent with our other results but their statistical significance is relatively small. Again, one of the reasons could be the relatively small statistical power of the tests, as returns are generally quite noisy. Another reason could be that the salient effects, such as Paris Agreement, take a longer time to materialize in investors’ beliefs.

To offer a longer-term perspective on the changing investors’ beliefs, we exploit the fact that climate change and carbon emissions were not yet salient issues in the 1990s. It is only in the last two decades, with the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and the repeated record-breaking temperatures, that climate change has turned into a widespread concern. This naturally raises the question of whether stock returns were already affected by corporate carbon emissions in the 1990s. If information about firm-level emissions was scarce and/or investors did not pay attention to carbon risk, one would expect that the pricing effects we identify between 2005 and 2017 would be much smaller back then. Given that our carbon emissions data begins in 2005, we cannot evaluate this hypothesis directly. However, we can impute back the unobserved emissions data for each firm in the 1990s from the values we observe later on. In other words, since emission levels are highly autocorrelated and the cross-sectional variation in emissions is stable over time (see Fig. 3), it seems reasonable, as a first pass, to assume that the cross-sectional variation of emissions in the 1990s tracks closely that observed in our data.

Specifically, we make the assumption that each firm with stocks trading during the 1990s has an emission intensity equal to the first officially reported value in the 2005-2017 period. We then collect the time-series information on each company’s revenues for the 1990-1999 period and impute the total value of emissions for each firm by taking the product of the emission intensity coefficient and the firm’s time-varying sales. We thus obtain a panel of imputed total corporate emissions for 1990-1999. We do exactly the same for emissions over our sample period. That is, we take the emission intensity coefficient for 2017 and impute back total emissions over the 2017-2005 sample period by multiplying this coefficient with the firm’s sales year by year. This latter imputation has the additional benefit of adding imputed emissions to our sample for all the new firms added to our sample in 2016 and provides another robustness check of our findings.

Next, we estimate the regression model in (1) using the imputed emission values for both time periods and report the results in Table 16. The process of imputation is not suitable to obtain the variation in emission growth rates since changes in emissions would vary one to one with changes in revenues. We have therefore considered an alternative model in which we have fixed the growth rates at the first available reported value and used it for all dates in the 1990-1999 period. The results from this estimation, available upon request, indicate that again the carbon premium is insignificant. The results in Panel A for the period of our sample indicate that this imputation works and that there is a significant carbon premium associated with the imputed level of emissions for all three scope categories. Notably, the magnitude of the results is even stronger than for the reported emission data. In contrast, the results in Panel B for the 1990s indicate that there was no significant carbon premium over this period. This finding is consistent with the quite plausible view that investors did not yet internalize carbon risk over this time period, but began to do so in the last two decades, as reporting on climate change, the effects of global warming, technological progress in renewable energy, and political action to curb carbon emissions intensified.

# 3.7. Robustness

We have explored a number of alternatives that provide insight on the effects we document. We report the specific tables in the Online Appendix. Below, we briefly summarize the main findings in these tables.

First, we estimate the carbon premium excluding the period of the financial crisis, which we define as the period from August 2007 to July 2009. The reason for excluding the financial crisis is that during this period the level of emissions is artificially low because of the crisis and stock returns are highly volatile. As a result, the relation between stock returns and carbon emissions may be distorted by the observations from the crisis period. Broadly, we find in Table A.8 that excluding the crisis period does not affect our results in a major way.

Second, we explore the robustness of our results to the alternative GIC 6-digit industry classification. How much does this alternative classification affect changes in the estimates when industry fixed effects are included? Again, the results, reported in Table A.9, are broadly similar to those obtained under the finer Trucost industry classification. Third, we exclude the salient industries from our analysis of the carbon premium pre and post Paris Agreement. The results are reported in Table A.10. If anything, the increase in the size of the premium is more pronounced in the non-salient industries (with the exception, possibly, of scope 3 emissions).

Fourth, we split the sample into two categories of firms, those that report their emissions and those for which emissions are estimated, and contrast how the carbon premium varies across the two categories. The results are reported in Table A.11. The coefficient for the level of scope 1 emissions is slightly smaller and slightly less significant for firms that disclose their emissions than for firms that do not. This is not entirely surprising given that, other things equal, firms are more likely to disclose their emissions if their performance on that dimension is better. Alternatively, firms that go out of their way to disclose may also have taken steps to reduce their emissions.16 Overall, the carbon premium is larger and more significant for the firms that do not.

16 The magnitudes of the coefficients of the estimated emissions could also be affected by measurement error. In general, such measurement error leads to attenuation bias; irrespective of the direction of the bias our comparisons should be treated with caution in the absence of a systematic adjustment for such an error.

disclose their emissions for all categories of emissions and for both emission levels and the growth in emissions (with one exception for scope 3 emission levels).

Fifth, we estimate the premium associated with the level and intensity of all three categories of emissions added up together. This is to facilitate comparison with the results in Garvey, Iyer, and Nash (2018) and In, Park, and Monk (2019). As one might expect based on our results for the disaggregated emissions, there is a highly significant premium associated with the level of emissions, but not with emission intensity. The results are presented in Table A.12. Sixth, we also report how institutional investor portfolios are not underweight companies with high levels of emissions (or high growth rates) in Table A.4. If anything, institutional investors load up on scope 2 and scope 3 emission levels. This could be a mechanical effect of their exclusionary screening policies based on scope 1 emission intensity.

Seventh, we further report how institutional investor portfolios are affected by the level of emissions in the companies they hold outside the salient industries tied to fossil fuels. We report the results in Table A.5. Interestingly, institutional investor portfolios load up on all three scope emission levels in the non-salient industries. Again, this is likely the consequence of institutional investors’ exclusionary screening in the salient industries. If they hold less in these industries, they must hold more in other industries. Table A.13 also reports the exposure to emission levels of institutional investors’ portfolios in the salient industries. Here we observe that their portfolios do not exhibit a significant tilt away from or into firms with high emission levels (with the exception of scope 3 emissions, where they are significantly underweight).

Eighth, we explore how sensitive the carbon premium is to the addition of other firm characteristics besides size. Table A.2 reports the results. It turns out that, controlling for other firm characteristics such as B/M, PPE, leverage, etc. matters. Without these controls, there is no significant premium associated with the level of emissions; however, the growth in emissions remains highly significant). Note also that when we add industry fixed effects, adding size as a control or not affects results, with a significant premium associated with the level of scope 1 emissions appearing only when we control for size.

Ninth, we check the robustness of our ownership regressions with respect to outliers using the natural logarithm transformation. The results, in Table A.14, indicate that there is no significant difference compared to our baseline results in Table 8. Tenth, we estimate the carbon premium on only the subset of firms for which we have carbon emission data before 2016. The results are reported in Table A.15. Although the size of the premium is a little smaller, it is broadly in line with the one estimated on the full sample.

# 4. Conclusion

How is climate change affecting stock returns? This is a fundamental question for the burgeoning field of climate change and finance. It is also a fundamental question for policy makers who are seeking to enlist investors in the fight against climate change. We address this question by undertaking a cross-sectional stock returns analysis, with carbon emissions as a firm characteristic, and find robust evidence that carbon emissions significantly and positively affect stock returns. There is a straightforward link between climate change mitigation and the reduction in carbon emissions. Whether through the production of their goods and services, or through the use of their products, firms are differentially affected by policies to curb carbon emissions and by renewable-energy technology shocks. Our evidence suggests that investors are discerning these cross-sectional differences and are pricing in carbon risk. We also find that the carbon premium cannot be explained through a sin stock divestment effect. Divestment takes place in a coarse way in a few industries such as oil and gas, utilities, and automobiles, and is entirely based on scope 1 emission intensity screens. Notably, we find no carbon premium associated with emission intensity. Moreover, outside the salient industries where all the divestment takes place, we find a robust, persistent, and significant carbon premium at the firm level for all three categories of emission levels and growth rates.

# Fig. 7. Carbon intensity and institutional ownership: cumulative effect.

Figures show the cumulative values of the coefficient of emission intensity estimated from the cross-sectional regressions of monthly firm-level institutional ownership on scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions intensity. The regressions include the same set of controls as Table 11. Panel A shows the plots for the full sample, Panel B shows the results for the sample of firms excluding salient industries (GIC 19, 20, 23), Panel C shows the results for the sample of firms excluding the same salient industries and also firms that are added to the sample post 2015. The data source is Trucost and the sample period is 2005-2017.

# Table 1. Summary statistics.

This table reports summary statistics (averages, medians, and standard deviations) for the variables used for the six sets of regressions. The sample period is 2005-2017. Panel A reports the emission variables. Panel B reports the cross-sectional return variables. RET is the monthly stock return; LOGSIZE is the natural logarithm of market capitalization (in $ million); B/M is the book value of equity divided by market value of equity; ROE is the return on equity; LEVERAGE is the book value of leverage defined as the book value of debt divided by the book value of assets; MOM is the cumulative stock return over the one-year period; INVEST/A is the CAPEX divided by book value of assets; HHI is the Herfindahl index of the business segments of a company with weights proportional to revenues; LOGPPE is the natural logarithm of plant, property & equipment (in $ million); BETA is the

CAPM beta calculated over the one year period; VOLAT is the monthly stock return volatility calculated over the one year period. Panel C reports the time-series variables. MKTRF is the monthly return on the value-weighted stock market net of the risk free rate; HML is the monthly return on the portfolio long value stocks and short growth stocks; SMB is the monthly return on the portfolio long small-cap stocks and short large-cap stocks; MOM is the monthly return on the portfolio long 12-month stock winners and short 12-month past losers; CMA is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on conservative investment stocks and short on aggressive investment stocks; BAB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low-beta stocks and short on high-beta stocks; LIQ is the liquidity factor of Pastor and Stambaugh; NET ISSUANCE is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high-net-issuance stocks and short on low-net-issuance stocks. Net issuance for year t is the change in the natural log of split-adjusted shares outstanding from the fiscal yearend in t-2 to the fiscal yearend in t-1; IDIO VOL is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. Panel D reports the ownership variables. IOi,t is the fraction of the shares of company i held by institutions in the FactSet database at the end of year t. IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions at the end of the year, and then dividing this amount by shares outstanding at the end of the year. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership by insurance companies; IO_INVESTCOS is the ownership by investment companies (e.g., mutual funds); IO_ADVISERS is the ownership by independent investment advisers; IO_PENSIONS is the ownership by pension funds; IO_HFS is the ownership by hedge funds. PRINVi,t is the inverse of firm i’s share price at the end of year t; TOT VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of daily stock returns for company i over the one-year period; VOLUMEi,t is the average daily trading volume (in $million) of stock i over the calendar year t; NASDAQi,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is listed on NASDAQ in year t, and zero otherwise; SP500i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is part of the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zero otherwise.

The dependent variable is RET. Our treatment sample is the subset of firms in the largest quartile of the distribution of firms sorted by the size of their carbon emission as of the end of 2014. We match these firms with a control group of firms with similar characteristics identified by the nearest neighbor method. The matching characteristics we use are the same as those in our return regressions. TREAT is a generic indicator variable taking the value one for firms in the treatment sample and zero for firms in the control sample, and AFTER is an indicator variable equal to zero for the period 2015/05-2015/11 and equal to one for the period 2015/12-2016/05. We estimate this model separately for each scope and emission measure. In the regressions, the sorts correspond to each scope measure which then separately identify each individual treatment variable. We also include firm and year-month fixed effects in the regression. All variables are defined in Table 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the firm and year/month level. All regressions for columns 4-6 include industry-fixed effects. We report the results for the natural logarithm of contemporaneous total emissions in Panel A; the results for the growth rate in firm emissions in Panel B; and the results for emission intensity in Panel C. ***1% significance; **5% significance; *10% significance.

Urbanization, Energy use, CO2 emissions, Development stages, STIRPAT model

Despite the relationship between urbanization, energy use and CO2 emissions has been extensively studied in recent years, little attention has been paid to differences in development stages or income levels. Most previous studies have implicitly assumed that the impact of urbanization is homogenous for all countries. This assumption can be questionable as there are many characteristic differences among countries of different levels of affluence. This paper investigates empirically the effects of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of the different development stages. Using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005, the findings suggest that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the stages of development. Surprisingly, urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups. The impact of urbanization on emissions is positive for all the income groups, but it is more pronounced in the middle-income group than in the other income groups. These novel findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also can be of special interest to policy makers and urban planners.

# 1. Introduction

Urbanization is a phenomenon of economic and social modernization. It is not only the process of transferring rural labor from an agricultural-based economy to urban areas where industrial and service sectors predominate, but also the process of the structural transformation of rural areas into urban areas. Through these complex processes, the world has undergone rapid urbanization in recent decades, with the world urban population increasing from 1.52 billion in 1975 to 3.29 billion in 2007 (UN, 2008). Further, the urban population is projected to double to about 6.4 billion by 2050. To support such unprecedented growth, additional urban infrastructure will inevitably be called for. This possibly causes more resource consumption, exerting additional pressure on the already fragile ecosystem. In 2006, cities consumed about two-thirds of global energy and produced over 70% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, even though only around half the world's population lived there (IEA, 2008).

The relationship between urbanization and various environmental issues, including energy use and emissions, has been studied extensively in recent years. Some researchers show that urbanization increases energy demand, generating more emissions (Cole and Neumayer, 2004; Jones, 1991; Parikh and Shukla, 1995; York, 2007). However, it remains unclear whether the impact of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions varies across the different levels of development or income. Further study with careful consideration of the different development stages is imperative.

the differences in development. Using a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005, the findings show that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the different levels of development. These novel empirical findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also deserve greater attention from policy makers.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background, literature review and hypotheses. Section 3 details the empirical model and methodology. Section 4 describes and discusses the results. Section 5 offers conclusions and policy implications.

# 2. Theoretical Background, Literature Review and Hypotheses

# 2.1. Theoretical Background

Although urbanization is often discussed in the context of economic modernization, it is a demographic indicator that increases urban density and transforms the organization of human behavior, thereby influencing household energy use patterns (Barnes et al., 2005). However, the extent to which urbanization affects national energy use and CO2 emissions has not been fully and clearly explained in a single theory. Instead, some possible impacts of urbanization on the environment are partially and separately discussed in three relevant theories: ecological modernization, urban environmental transition and compact city theories. The first theory focuses on impacts at the national level, while the others discuss impacts at the city level.

Ecological modernization theory emphasizes not only economic modernization but also social and institutional transformations in explaining the effects of modernization on the environment. In this theory, urbanization is the process of social transformation regarded as one important indicator of modernization. It is argued that environmental problems may increase from low to intermediate stages of development. However, further modernization can minimize such problems, as societies come to realize the importance of environmental sustainability, seeking to decouple environmental impact from economic growth through technological innovation, urban agglomeration, and the shift toward knowledge and service based industries (Crenshaw and Jenkins, 1996; Gouldson and Murphy, 1997; Mol and Spaargaren, 2000).

The urban environmental transition theory mainly discusses the types of urban environmental issues and their evolution. It suggests that urban environmental problems vary with respect to stages of economic development (McGranahan et al., 2001). Because of limited resources, low stages of development often face poverty-related environmental problems (lack of safe water supply and inadequate sanitation). However, as income levels rise, these problems gradually subside. The increasing wealth of cities is often accompanied by an increase in manufacturing activities, causing substantial industrial pollution-related issues (water and air pollution). Nonetheless, such problems decrease in wealthy cities as the result of improved environmental regulations, technological progress and structural change in the economy.

However, wealthy cities are often associated with consumption-related environmental issues. Consumption patterns and lifestyles of the wealthy cities tend to be more resource intensive than those of lower-income cities. As cities become affluent, demands for urban infrastructure, transportation and individual resource consumption rise. Consequently, consumption-related issues such as energy consumption and CO2 emissions become more prominent. The three types of urban environmental issues could occur simultaneously at the same development stage (Bai and Imura, 2000; Marcotullio et al., 2003). However, the dominant issues of each stage described by this theory seem plausible.

The compact city theory mainly discusses the environmental benefits of urban compaction. The theory argues that high urban density allows cities to exploit economies of scale for urban public infrastructure (e.g., public transport, schools and water supply), and reduces car dependency, travel distance, the transmission and distribution losses of electricity supply, decreasing energy consumption and CO2 emissions (Burton, 2000; Capello and Camagni, 2000; Jenks et al., 1996; Newman and Kenworthy, 1989). However, some critics argue that increasing urban density is likely to cause traffic congestion, overcrowding and greater air pollution, which will outweigh the claimed benefits of compact cities (Breheny, 2001; Rudlin and Falk, 1999). In turn, this may increase energy use and emissions. Without adequate urban infrastructure support, greater urban density can cause substantial urban environmental issues (Burgess, 2000).

# 2.2. Literature Review

The relationship between urbanization and various forms of environmental pressure, including energy consumption and CO2 emissions, has been extensively investigated in recent decades using various types of data and models at the national, city and household level. To start with, using a national level analysis with cross-sectional data, Jones (1991) derived a positive correlation between urbanization and energy use per capita, noting that while urbanization enabled cities to benefit from economies of scale in production, it increased transport energy use and energy use per unit of output. Using a STIRPAT model, York et al. (2003a,b) also found that urbanization positively affects national energy footprints and emissions. Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. (2002) examined the relationship between urbanization and deforestation rates in developing nations using the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model. The results suggested that deforestation rates increase at the early stage of urbanization, but decline as urbanization advances. This curvilinear relationship was attributed to the effects of urban agglomeration and growing service sector dominance in urban areas.

In a time-series data context, Alam et al. (2007) investigated the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in Pakistan with a model similar to the STIRPAT, and found a positive link between urbanization and emissions. Liu (2009) also found that urbanization positively influences energy use, but that the magnitude of the influence is declining. Liu (2009) attributed this decreasing influence to improvements in industrial and technological structure and more efficient utilization of resources. Similarly, Holtedahl and Joutz (2004) suggested that urbanization increases residential energy consumption for two reasons. First, moving to urban areas increases household accessibility to electricity. Second, households that had access to electricity in rural areas may increase their energy consumption after moving to urban areas by using existing electric appliances and after the purchase of new items.

In a panel data context, Parikh and Shukla (1995) showed that urbanization increases per capita energy consumption, noting that urbanization affects energy use in three ways: first, by shifting energy use from traditional fuels to modern fuels, second, by increasing embodied energy consumption through goods and service demands, and third, via direct household and transport consumption. Using the STIRPAT model, similar evidence was obtained by York (2007), who further argued that even in the most modernized nations, urbanization contributes to the growth of energy use. Following a similar model, Cole and Neumayer (2004) found that urbanization increases CO2 emissions. On the other hand, Mishra et al. (2009) reported that the relationship between urbanization and per capita energy was negative in New Caledonia, but positive in Fiji, French Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga. Using the EKC model and OECD data, Liddle (2004) found that urbanization and population density negatively affect per capita road transport energy use, implying that populous and highly urbanized societies have less demand for personal transport.

In terms of analysis at the city level, Newman and Kenworthy (1989) examined the relationship between urban density and transport energy use using data on 32 cities in high-income countries, and found that high urban density is associated with less per capita transport energy use. Likewise, Chen et al. (2008) investigated the impact of urban compaction on household energy use using Chinese city data, concluding a negative link between urban density and per.

capita household energy consumption. Moreover, Dodman (2009) Concerning the relationship between urbanization and emissions, the found that per capita greenhouse gas emissions of several wealthy cities were significantly lower than their national average for two reasons. The first is that most of these cities have highly dense building forms with small average dwelling sizes. These require less energy to heat, light and cool than those in suburban or rural areas. The second reason is that these cities have extensive public transport systems with lower car ownership levels than the national average. Similarly, Dhakal et al. (2002) reported that per capita CO2 emissions were lower in cities at a higher development stage (Tokyo and Seoul) than in those at a lower development stage (Beijing and Shanghai).

# 3. Empirical Model and Methodology

# 3.1. Empirical Model

The impact of demographic and economic factors on the environment is largely postulated in the IPAT identity (I=PAT) proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971). The equation denotes I as environmental impact, which is determined by a multiplicative combination of three factors: population size (P), per capita consumption (usually proxied by per capita affluence) (A) and the level of environmentally damaging technology or the impact per unit of economic activity (T). The value of T is often derived from the known values of I, P and A, and is equal to I/(PA) or I/GDP.

The IPAT model is a very simple and useful framework, yet has two limitations (Dietz and Rosa, 1994). First, it is only a mathematical identity and cannot be used directly to test hypotheses on the impact of each factor on the environment. Second, it simply assumes that the elasticities of environmental impact to population, affluence and technology are unitary. For instance, a 1% increase in per capita income increases environmental impact by 1%. This contradicts the EKC hypothesis, which exhibits an inverted U-shape on the income–environment relationship (World Bank, 1992).

The IPAT model was later reformulated in the STIRPAT model of Dietz and Rosa (1997), where I = aPibATidu. Here, a is the constant term of the equation, b, c and d are the parameters of A, P and T, respectively, u denotes the disturbance term and subscript i represents the unit of analysis. Importantly, unlike the original IPAT identity, multiple variables other than A and P that influence the impact per unit of economic activity can express T (York et al., 2003b). For instance, Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2007) proxied T with the share of industry in GDP and energy intensity, while Shi (2003) employed the share of the industrial and service sectors in the economy as a proxy. As urbanization is one of the important factors influencing energy use and emissions, several studies included it in the STIRPAT model and estimated its impact on energy use, emissions and energy footprints (Cole and Neumayer, 2004; York et al., 2003a,b; York, 2007).

# 3.2. Methodology

We employ the STIRPAT model (I = aPibATidu) reformulated by Dietz and Rosa (1997), and add urbanization as an additional variable. After taking natural logarithms of both sides of the model and rearranging, we can write the empirical models for the panel data of total energy use and CO2 emissions as follows.

ln Energyit = a0 + a1 ln(Pit) + a2 ln(Ait) + a3 ln(INDit) + a4 ln(SVit) + a5 ln(URBit) + Yt + Ci + u1it (1)

ln CO2it = b0 + b1 ln(Pit) + b2 ln(Ait) + b3 ln(INDit) + b4 ln(SVit) + b5 ln(URBit) + b6 ln(EIit) + Yt + Ci + u2it (2)

where P denotes population size and A is per capita GDP. As in Shi (2003), in the energy use equation (Eq. (1)), T is proxied with two variables: the share of the industry (IND) and service sectors (SV) in GDP. In addition to these two variables, energy intensity is included in the CO2 emission equation (Eq. (2)). Note that the energy intensity variable cannot be included in Eq. (1) because it is measured by total energy use divided by GDP, containing part of the dependent variable.

URB denotes urbanization, a0 and b0 are the constant terms, and u1 and u2 are the disturbance terms for Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. Y is a year dummy that captures the time-speciﬁc effect. This can capture the effects of changes in global energy prices and technological progress not proxied by T. It also helps remove possible cross-sectional dependence in the equations (Petersen, 2009). C is a country dummy used to capture the unobserved country-speciﬁc effect, namely geographic location and resource endowment, as these possibly affect energy consumption and emissions. Adding country and time dummies is a standard treatment for panel data analysis, helping minimize heterogeneity bias and problems with possible spurious regression (Wooldridge, 2007). Therefore, the previously discussed equations are robust against omitted variables, generating reliable estimates.

This paper estimates the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions using a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries covering the period from 1975 to 2005, yielding 3069 observations. The sample is considerably larger in terms of countries and years when compared with many previous studies. To fully address the concern whether urbanization pressure on energy use and emissions differs across the different levels of income and to empirically test the arguments of the ecological modernization and urban environmental transition theories, we divide our estimation into two parts. First, we estimate the whole sample without consideration of different income levels. Second, we estimate the sample divided into three income groups, low-, middle- and high-income groups, based on country classifications in 2004 (World Bank, 2009). The low-income group consists of 23 countries, while the middle- and high-income groups consist of 43 and 33 countries, respectively (see Table A.1 in Appendix A).

The data on population, urbanization, GDP, the share of the industry and service sectors in GDP are mainly from the World Bank (2007). The GDP information was missing for some countries, but we filled it in with the data from IEA (2009b,c). The data on industry and services were also missing for a number of countries. Fortunately, we found the missing information in the United Nations online database (UN, 2009). The data on CO2 emissions and energy use are derived from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2009a,b,c). The energy intensity and carbon intensity information is calculated using data from the World Bank (2007) and IEA (2009a,b,c). Table 1 provides a detailed description of the variables and the data sources used in this study.

To check whether the data used in this study are stationary or not, we performed four different but commonly quoted unit root tests in the current empirical literature for panel data. The first test was proposed by Levin et al. (2002) (hereafter LLC). The null hypothesis of this test assumes that there is a common unit root process and the autoregressive coefficient is identical across cross-sections. Conversely, the second test developed by Im et al. (2003) (hereafter IPS) allows the autoregressive coefficient to vary across cross-sections. The third and fourth tests proposed by Maddala and Wu (1999) and Choi (2001) (hereafter ADF and PP) share the same assumption as for the IPS test. Given the heterogeneity in the sample, the IPS, ADF and PP tests are more relevant in this study. However, we put more emphasis on the IPS test as the sample meets its asymptotic requirements (numbers of cross-sections are larger than numbers of years). The test results show that all the variables are stationary except for GDP and energy intensity. However, the two series became stationary after taking first differences (see Table A.2 in Appendix A). Another benefit from first differencing is that it helps reduce or even remove serial correlation (Wooldridge, 2007). We applied the autocorrelation test proposed by Wooldridge (2002) and the heteroskedasticity test.

# 4. Results and Discussion

# 4.1. Descriptive Analysis of the Main Variables

Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrates urbanization levels, per capita energy use and emissions for the three income groups in 1975 and 2005. As shown, these vary across the income groups: the higher the per capita income of a country, the greater its urbanization level, per capita energy use and emissions. In 1975, the degree of urbanization was 72% in high-income countries, only 24% in low-income countries and 48% in middle-income countries. In addition, per capita energy use and emissions of the high-income group in 1975 and 2005 were also significantly higher than for the other income groups. In 1975, each person in the high-income group on average consumed about 3.6 tons of oil equivalents (toe) and generated over 9 metric tons of CO2, significantly greater than each person in the low-income group consumed (0.43 toe) and emitted (0.30 ton).

The figure also shows differential changes in urbanization levels, per capita energy use and emissions between 1975 and 2005 among the three income groups. Compared with the other groups, the middle-income group experienced a greater increase in its urbanization level, rising from 48% in 1975 to 65% in 2005. The growth in its per capita emissions was around 40%, slightly lower than the growth in its energy consumption (45%). Similarly, between 1975 and 2005, the per capita energy use of the high-income group increased by about 58%, while its per capita CO2 emissions grew only 37%. In contrast, in the low-income group, per capita energy use was nearly unchanged, whereas its per capita CO2 emissions increased approximately 23%.

Fig. 2 details the relative percentage changes in urbanization, population, energy intensity, CO2 emissions, energy use and CO2 intensity compared with the base year (1975 = 0). Note that the

changes in energy use and CO2 emissions plotted in Figs. 2 and 1 are different as the former employs aggregate data, while the latter uses per capita data. The most significant change in urbanization in 2005 was in the low-income group, while the least change occurred in the high-income group because of its high degree of urbanization.

Similarly, the changes in the energy use and CO2 emissions of the low-income group in 2005 were significantly larger than those of the middle- and high-income groups. The change in the energy use of the low-income group was nearly 180%, while in the middle- and high-income groups, it was about 147% and 58%, respectively. Between 1975 and 2005, the emissions growth of the low-income group was nearly 357%, whereas it was about 132% in the middle-income group and only 38% in the high-income group.

Over the period 1975–2003, while the energy intensity of the low-income group steadily declined below the year 1975 level, in the middle-income group, it fluctuated over time and then fell. Surprisingly, in the high-income group, it increased until 1988 and then started declining. However, it was still above the base year level. This is mainly due to the fact that this income group consists of several major oil exporting countries, largely influencing the group's average energy intensity.

# 4.2. Empirical Results and Discussion

Table 2 reports the estimated results for the whole sample, while Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the results of the low-, middle- and high-income groups, respectively. As the FD models (Models 4, 8, 12 and 16) are the preferred models, our main interpretations focus only on these models.

# Fig. 2. Relative percentage changes in urbanization, population, energy intensity, CO2 emissions, energy use and carbon intensity by income groups compared with their 1975 level (calculated using data from the World Bank (2007) and IEA (2008a,b,c)).

The estimated coefficients in the FD model (Model 4 listed in Table 2) are all statistically significant at the 5% level or lower, except for the coefficient of urbanization. The relationship between urbanization and energy use is positive but insignificant, whereas population size, GDP per capita and economic structure positively affect energy use. The elasticity of energy use to population growth is 1.23, while the elasticity to GDP per capita is 0.316. A 1% increase in the share of the industrial and service sector in the economy raises energy use by 0.069% and 0.049%, respectively.

However, the results of Models 8, 12 and 16 show that the impact of urbanization on energy use is statistically significant at the 10% level or lower, and differs across the various development stages. Surprisingly, a 1% increase in urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group by 0.132%, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups by 0.507% and 0.907%, respectively. The positive link between urbanization and energy use is evident in several previous studies (Jones, 1991; Parikh and Shukla, 1995; York, 2007).

The effects of population growth, GDP per capita and economic structure on energy consumption are also heterogeneous across the different income groups. The elasticity of energy use to population change in the middle-income group is about 1.7, significantly greater than in the low- (0.601) and high-income groups (1.196). Similarly, the elasticity of energy use to changes in income in the middle-income group is 0.30, notably greater than in the low-income group (0.18), but slightly smaller than in the high-income group (0.376). The impact of the share of industrial activity in the economy on energy consumption is positive, but statistically significant for only the low- and middle-income groups. The contribution of the share of services in GDP to energy consumption is positive, but statistically significant for only the middle-income group.

The negative urbanization elasticity of energy use in the low-income group seems to support the argument of urban compaction. However, as many cities of this income group still lack basic public services, the negative elasticity is unlikely to be the result of economies of scale for public infrastructure. Rather, it could possibly be due to the effects of modernization, particularly the effect of improved access to modern forms of energy use. The findings are supported by Pachauri (2004) and Pachauri and Jiang (2008), who found that fuel switching from inefficient solid fuels to modern forms of energy use causes per capita household energy use in urban areas to be lower than in rural areas. It is evident that the share of biomass in total energy use in the low-income group significantly decreased from around 75% in 1975 to 66% in 2005 (see Fig. B(b) in Appendix B).

As described previously, further urbanization in the high-income group seems to increase rather than to decrease energy use. This supports the argument of the urban environmental transition theory that consumption-related issues are most pronounced in high-income countries. Unlike the other income groups, the high-income group uses much private and public infrastructure in supporting their urban population and urban economies. Constructing, maintaining and operating the infrastructure involve significant amounts of energy resources. Moreover, consumption patterns and lifestyles in cities of developed countries tend to be more resource intensive than in the cities of developing countries. High levels of energy use in the high-income group also reflect in Fig. 1(a).

Table 6 reports the results for the whole sample, whereas Tables 7, 8 and 9 show the results for the low-, middle- and high-income groups, respectively. As the FD models (Models 20, 24, 28 and 32) address all important econometric concerns, our main interpretations focus only on these models.

The estimated results of Model 20 (Table 6) are all statistically significant at the 5% level or lower, except for the coefficients of economic structure. The results show that population size, GDP per capita, urbanization and energy intensity positively influence emissions. A 1% increase in urbanization raises emissions by 0.447%, all other factors being equal. The elasticity of emissions to population growth is 1.125, indicating a moderately elastic relationship, while the elasticities of emissions to GDP per capita and energy intensity are approximately one, suggesting a unit elastic relationship. The coefficients for industry as percent of GDP and services as percent of GDP appear positive but statistically insignificant.

However, the results of Models 24, 28 and 32 indicate that the relationship between urbanization and emissions varies across the different stages of development. The urbanization elasticity of emissions in the middle-income group is 0.512, greater than in both the low- (0.43) and the high-income group (0.358). The effects of population growth, GDP per capita, economic structure and energy intensity are also heterogeneous across the different income groups. The elasticity of emissions to population change in the low-income group is about 1.75, significantly greater than in the middle-income group (1.228) and in the high-income group (1.122). Similarly, the impact of income and energy intensity on emissions in the low- and middle-income groups is larger than in the high-income group. These results are consistent with the findings by Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2007) and Shi (2003). Like Model 20, none of the coefficients for economic structure in Models 24, 28 and 32 is statistically significant.

It should be noted that in the low-income group, the relationship between urbanization and energy use is negative, while the relationship between urbanization and emissions is positive. This phenomenon could occur as this income group shifts from traditional fuels (biomass) to fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), which are more efficient but may have more CO2 emissions. The share of coal and oil in their total energy use increased from 21% in 1975 to 24% in 2005 (see Fig. B(a) in Appendix B). Over the same period, their carbon intensity exhibited an upward trend as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Another point worth noting is that the impact of urbanization on energy use of the high-income group is greater than that of the middle-income group, whereas its urbanization elasticity of emissions is smaller than that of the middle-income group. This can possibly be attributed to structural change in energy use. The high-income group significantly decreased the share of coal and oil in their total energy use from around 71% in 1975 to only 56% in 2005 (see Fig. B(a) in Appendix B). The tendency of fuel usage switching toward low carbon intensive fuels (e.g., natural gas and nuclear energy) is shown in Fig. 2(c). The carbon intensity of the high-income group significantly declined over the period 1975–2005. The share of coal and oil in the total energy use of the middle-income group also declined. However, its carbon intensity did not decline as steadily as that of the high-income group. This could possibly relate to differences in their technological efficiency.

The impact of urbanization on emissions not only varies across the three income groups, but also appears greater in the middle-income group. This trend conforms to the argument of the ecological modernization theory that the process of modernization may cause substantial environmental issues. However, further modernization can reduce these problems. Despite different environmental indicators, the findings are in line with previous research by Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. (2002), who found an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and deforestation rates. Fig. 3 summarizes the urbanization elasticities of energy use and CO2 emissions (derived from Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).

# 5. Conclusion

Unlike previous studies, this paper investigated empirically the impact of urbanization on total energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of different levels of development using the STIRPAT model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005. The sample was divided into three different groups (low-, middle- and high-income groups), and they were separately analyzed. The results suggest that the effects of urbanization on energy use and emissions vary significantly across these income groups.

# Generative AI has the potential to change the software profession more than any other recent technology.

Bill Gates sees it as the biggest move forward since the invention of the Internet. It can improve software productivity in several ways, such as automating repetitive tasks such as testing or requirements traceability, improve software quality by creating test suites from requirements, and automating workflows by routing work products to the next suitable step in a production pipeline. At the same time generative AI creates fully new risks because it is neither deterministic nor explainable. IPR and Cybersecurity are prominent examples that limit usage in professional software engineering.

# Generative AI Technologies

Generative AI has been around for many years. With no means to prove validity, researchers hesitated to bring such technology to the mass market of rather naïve data citizens. As we have observed many times in recent IT history, the perceived gold rush makes people closing eyes in front of obvious risks. Even tools designed for good will eventually have devastating consequences. When ChatGPT was finally released to a wide public audience in 2022, the AI arms race started at a speed never seen before. It took for ChatGPT just two months to reach a hundred million users. Fig. 1 shows this fast evolution for different technologies spanning a mere hundred years of recent human history. A technology like the wheel even took thousands of years to reach a hundred million users.

For every developer, turning to StackOverflow or Google has been a natural part of the job for years now. Condemning the Not Invented Here Syndrome to the dustbin, our first reaction when in doubt how to code something has been to look it up on the internet. Search engines have got better at indexing code repositories, myriads of which exist online, and community advice sites, such as StackOverflow, provide reasoned solutions and valuable commentary on user questions. What is common in search engines and question and answer websites is that you can lookup information that has already been stored there.

# Generative AI is different.

As the name suggests, it can synthesize, or generate, the answers to the questions you pose. Instead of trawling a prefabricated answer as classic search engines are doing, it will create an answer for you. The answer is based on vast amounts of data on which it has been trained, such as those archived and indexed by search engines. To provide meaningful answers, Generative AI undergoes further training based on human feedback. Many human trainers pose questions and provide feedback on the generated answers, rewarding good answers and punishing unsatisfying ones. This kind of reinforcement learning guides the system towards providing more accurate answers, while guarding against harmful responses. This has led to glimpses of a new way of working, where the focus is on “prompt engineering”: find the most appropriate way to frame a question, or a whole dialog. Generative AI does not work with individual question and answers: it maintains a context window, which can be used to guide the AI in generating contextually relevant and well-informed responses.

Underlying all this, Generative AI is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As the name suggests, these are large neural network models that are trained on big language corpora. Technically, they have a Transformer architecture, which is based on a mechanism called attention. The publication of the attention mechanism, by Google researchers, must now rank among the most influential papers in Computer Science [1]. Two early LLMs were BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), developed by Google in 2018 [2], and GPT-1 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1), developed by OpenAI who went on to develop subsequent GPT models, getting to GPT-4 today [3].

The basic idea is to use a large language corpus to train a neural network to learn the language, by hiding part of the text and asking the network to guess the missing parts [4]. The neural network does that by paying selective attention to the words comprising the surrounding context of the missing parts. The words themselves are represented as vectors, called embeddings, in a multi-dimensional space. In essence, the neural network learns, and represents the meaning of each word in a numerical format, which can then be processed by the AI model. This is achieved by mapping words to vectors in a high-dimensional space, where words with similar meanings are situated closer together. These probabilistic representations can then be used to generate entirely new text – for instance, the answer to a query. When we talk about language and words, we are not restricted to human language: it can be computer code, having code tokens instead of words; the idea is the same.

You can see a simplified depiction of the internals of a LLM in Fig. 2. The model follows the transformer architecture [4]. The inputs, which are language or code tokens, are represented as vector embeddings. Then they go through an encoder, which is a series of attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms are an algorithm used in LLMs that enables the AI to focus on specific parts of the input text when generating an output.

# Output of the Encoder

The output of the encoder is a vector representation of the input, which is produced by analyzing surrounding context and attentions. You can think of the encoder’s output as the meaning of the input, as understood by the neural network.

Once we have the encoded input, we need to transform it to the desired output, that is, take it from a vector representation and transform it back to a language or code token. To do this we feed it to another series of attention mechanisms, the decoder. The output of the decoder are candidate tokens, which are then assigned probabilities. The most probable token is the final output. These probabilities result from training the entire transformer model, including both the encoder and decoder, with vast amounts of text. ChatGPT is said to be trained with the “entire internet”. The training process is referred to as "self-supervised learning" (or "masked language modeling"), which is achieved by hiding some parts of known text and checking the quality of how it is automatically completed. In this way the decoder will learn to predict the missing output given the encoded input. After training, the model receives prompts or queries. Each prompt will be encoded as before and then fed to the decoder. This time the decoder works only with the encoded input as we don’t have a known output at hand. With adequate training, the model will predict a useful final output. Obviously with restricted domains, such as code fragments or test cases, the LLM needs less training.

# Generative AI for Developers

Several generative software platforms are available, which allow to turn simple instructions into computer code. GitHub Copilot is available as an extension to development tools and editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim and JetBrain IDEs. It offers code autocomplete that is powered by OpenAI Codex, a Generative AI system developed also by OpenAI. A tantalizing development is the recent announcement of Copilot X, powered by GPT-4, which apart from improved autocompletion can aid in other development tasks, such as understanding code, improving pull requests, and aiding in scripting and shell tools.

# Generative AI for Software Productivity

GPT-4 can generate code from docstrings and solve coding questions in software engineering interviews on a par or surpassing human performance. It can program for the front-end and interact with LaTeX. It can reverse engineer code, execute Python code, and execute pseudo code. OpenAI, the company behind GPT-4, offers programmatic access to its LLMs. That means that developers can use them not only in conversational manner, but also embed them into their applications. It is also possible to develop plugins, which are ways to connect the underlying models with third-party services that can respond to questions and act on them.

Code completion, at a line or whole function level is offered by Tabnine, which positions itself apart from the competition by paying special attention to licensing and privacy issues. Tabnine has been trained only on open-source software with permissive licenses. Moreover, it assures developers that it does not retain any of the code in which it is used, and it is also possible to download and use the underlying models locally, instead of only being accessible as a service.

Table 1 summarizes some mainstream technologies. Note that the landscape changes very fast. If anything, we can expect existing tools to improve, and new tools to enter the scene.

Generative AI has the potential to significantly improve software productivity by automating tasks, enhancing creativity, improving accuracy and efficiency, and streamlining development processes. Application domains with a high business impact are the following:

- Media content creation, e.g., text, audio, video, pictures, content for news feed and social media
- Media content improvement, i.e., from making enhancements, references (though mostly they hallucinate and invent references that do not exist), and explanations up to augmented content generation with pay per use.
- Generative design, such as chip-design in semiconductor business, developing novel building and city architectures, material design in chemical plants, innovative drugs and medication in pharma industries.

# Software Development and Generative AI

Software development, such as code generation, test case generation from requirements, re-establishing traceability, explaining code, refactoring of legacy code, software maintenance with augmented guidance and improving existing code. We will focus here on improving software development and software productivity with generative AI (see sidebar with “Generative AI Industry Case Study” for an application).

Even though we have focused on code-related tasks, the capabilities of generative AI tools extend well beyond assisting in writing code. Generative AI can improve software productivity in various aspects of Software Engineering, such as:

# Enhancing Creativity

Generative AI can assist developers in generating new ideas and solutions for software and UX development. For example, it can help developers to generate new designs, logos, and user interfaces.

# Summarizing Documentation

LLMs are particularly good at these tasks, freeing time for other tasks. Generative AI responds to prompts, and these prompts can be customized and pre-defined for various tasks, such as automatic search and enhancements. We can give the prompts through API calls, in this way integrating the use of LLMs with our development pipeline.

# Problem Solving

Generative AI has been shown to be able to exhibit mathematical and algorithmic abilities, though currently still weak, because the LLMs were not trained to interpret the meaning of numeric representations and complex relationships between numbers. Programmers can describe a problem that needs to be solved and provide some guidance on how to solve it (e.g., “use dynamic programming”) and then the tool can generate code to the task. For instance, you provide a requirement like: "Make a list of major taxation laws in country X in Python language" and you will get a usable piece of code including well-named variables and documentation. For a wide variety of problems, Generative AI will spit out a usable solution, especially where commonly used algorithms are involved. Also, here we have new challenges, namely the more detailed and not trivial your request, the higher the probability that the code contains errors, which you will not find as you don’t know how to test exception cases.

# Efficient Development

It can be used to streamline software development processes by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and deployment. An example could be routing of tasks such as regression test. This can help to reduce development time and costs and improve overall productivity.

# Maintaining Legacy

Most software that is produced today is legacy or based on legacy. A lot of trusted safety-critical software in domains such as power plants or defense is decades old. Many federal systems are based on Cobol and other antiquated languages. The challenge is increasingly to find people able to maintain such legacy. Generative AI tools in future might explain how the code works and translates it into any other language, e.g., a Python code into JavaScript. In many cases, the AI not only points out possible quality problems, but it also provides better alternatives.

# Improving Software Quality

Generative AI can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that human developers might miss. An example is the selection of appropriate test cases. This can help developers to write more accurate and efficient code, and to identify and fix bugs more quickly. New challenges arise such as how to ensure that AI-based systems would not be validated by AI systems that are programmed to overlook certain defects or backdoors. Deep fake applies to software even more than only pictures.

# Improving Data Quality

An important feature of using Generative AI for software-related tasks is the ability to fine tune an existing model on specific data. LLMs are trained on open data that is trawled from the internet, and their answers are based on what they can learn from that data. It is possible, through appropriate APIs, to give to LLMs our own data. The typical steps are to prepare our training data, then upload them to the model and let it train on that data, on top of its existing training. Then we used the fine-tuned model, which will be able to provide more relevant answers to our prompts, either typed in, or through API calls.

# Achieving Trust

While traditional software is based on pre-defined algorithms, current software is adaptive, self-changing and learning. Such systems do not behave according to initial specifications and might even “unlearn” what they were initially developed to do. It is not meaningful to discuss the validation of AI systems without using nearly realistic systems and contexts. Testing non-deterministic systems is difficult with deterministic tests. With traditional software testing, release criteria are based on comparing reactions to a given series of inputs with expected outputs. Simulations of cyber-physical systems suffers from the enormous state space of AI systems if not applied purposefully. For instance, autonomous vehicles need several hundred million kilometers to statistically prove that they are suitable for real traffic. Synthetic data developed by Generative AI around corner cases and critical scenarios facilitates development, testing, approval, and homologation of automatic, robotic, and autonomous systems in critical industries such as medical, aerospace, mobility and industrial production [9].

# Hints for the Practitioner

While Generative AI can help companies to grow competences there are several risks that need to be considered and mitigated [7]. Technology companies and especially their venture-capitalist backers tend to just look for fast money and repeat past mistakes, namely prioritizing growth over safety. OpenAI’s 2020 predecessor to ChatGPT for instance was known for “creative” outputs which were as easy to read and use as Wikipedia entries but were inhumane and racist [8]. Google explicitly announced plans to release a premature Bard, accepting the high risk it is willing to take when releasing tools based on AI technology. The lessons from social media should guide us in developing AI. What is labelled “social networks” had over the past ten years eroded true social connections and trust between people. With several hours per day on these networks mental-health and intelligence is declining at an alarming pace. Societies in many countries are deeply polarized due to fake news which is consumed without much thinking about it. Tools such as ChatGPT could further replace professional independent media and spread fake news that are neither traceable nor explainable. As developers we must get hands-on and deal with such risks.

The name of “Generative AI” cues the major pitfall. If humans rely on AI for information, it will be increasingly difficult to tell what is factual, what is an exaggerating advertisement, and what is completely made up for misinformation. The answers and solutions are generated by models based on probabilities, not necessarily found from some authoritative source. That means that they may be wrong. AI tools can hallucinate, responding in a wildly erroneous manner while being supremely confident that they are right. Things are improving (GPT-4 seems to be better than its predecessors), but the user should always check the answers. Relying on AI tools for tasks where you cannot determine the correct answer or how to verify it can lead to complications and pitfalls. For software development it means that human supervision and intervention is necessary, such as reviews.

With statistically driven synthesis of results, Generative AI does not have a real understanding of language. More dangerous is that it has no knowledge of the real world. The language model produces its “facts” with nice-to-read text or code. But it is the user’s responsibility to verify these statements. Creativity and the capability to detect defects are the most important characteristics that distinguish you and your code from an AI. Even if it is tempting to let an algorithm do as much work for you as possible, you should always be aware that it makes mistakes, which it admittedly packages very credibly. When users started posting bug fixes generated with tools such as ChatGPT, StackOverflow banned such posts. How do they identify the fake content? The same way as a professor today must verify homework assignments, namely by means of AI. It is an arms race, and quite good tools are around to identify AI-generated documents with statistical analyses.

Practitioners should also be aware of privacy and security implications. When using a tool that analyses your code, you should be careful about what happens to that code. If your code is open source, then it probably does not matter that it may leave traces in the tool’s models, or even be used as training material for the tool itself. But in proprietary code, you may not wish for your code to leave the confines of your private repositories. Different tools give different assurances for that; you should read the terms of use carefully.

It is difficult to impossible to identify what is original work and what is generated fake, such as pictures and videos used for misinformation. Demanding a source statement will not work, because those who want evil, will not follow such self-imposed rules. Watermarks on all levels or being embedded up to steganographic algorithms can easily be removed. Forensic AI researchers propose using end-to-end blockchain trust mechanisms to label what has been a proven original piece of work. Yet the challenge remains to make the initial prove on which the blockchain will be based upon.

A major risk is about cybersecurity of generated code. Generative AI tools and platform might be misused and trained to insert unwanted code fragments into any code they process. Such snippets might look innocent but could introduce backdoors, manipulate data, or feed information to external targets. Though this holds for any code reuse, cyber warfare will enter a new stage with AI-based generated code which is hard to understand and test. Verification and validation of AI will grow in relevance. Software practitioners need to enhance their competences on the right side of the "V" in order to verify accuracy of underlying AI and resulting artefacts.

Software Engineering for and with AI must start with assertions that create boundaries of what is allowed and what not. Like Isaac Asimov’s robotic rules, our society and specifically IT professionals must specify upfront what is not (!) to happen. Requirements engineering must start with negative requirements, such as which misuse

# Generative AI and Software Engineering

Cases, confuse cases and abuse cases must be avoided, and what transformations would be explicitly allowed. Generative AI will in near future think and learn much more efficiently in certain areas than humans. With future AI systems rapidly improving themselves without human intervention, they could potentially wipe out humanity. A simple thought experiment would be ecology. Today many politicians put the climate change risks to extraordinary levels, forgetting about other challenges we have. A Generative AI that copies such single-minded behavior might conclude to just stop human life on earth to reduce climate change.

In a world of Generative AI and low code, it's hard to imagine a future where software engineers are as highly paid as today. Many traditional roles such as programmer will change. With the current evolution speed, we can expect that within the next three years most software companies will have an AI-augmented development and testing strategy, up from very few today. Most internet content and mobile apps will be fully or largely commanded by generative AI. Software developers will need new competencies, such as improving automatically generated software, feeding learning engines, and exploring behaviors which are not explainable. Generative AI will accelerate software development. Yet be aware of marketing hype on shortcuts to building secure, resilient software based on not deterministic technologies.

These are exciting times, not just for Software Engineers. Some even argue that we may witnessing the first sparks of Artificial General Intelligence [5] – or maybe not (yet) [6]. In any case Generative AI is here to stay, it is likely to be a game changer, and change Software Engineering as well. As with any new technology it can be used, misused, and abused. Elon Musk who is known for much, but not stopping innovations, demands oversight for artificial intelligence, having described the technology as “potentially more dangerous than nukes.” As those who develop this technology, we as leading practitioners must safeguard and control AI.

# Side-Bar: Generative AI Industry Case Study

At Vector we are often called to improve the quality of software systems. One typical finding is insufficient requirements and test strategy. Some software is tested several times, while some requirements and scenarios remain untested, making increasingly complex software systems impossible to trust. While software development is simple, identifying the right requirements and test cases is a challenge for practically all companies. This is a high risk, especially when automating critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and finance systems. Policy makers demand trusted AI, which demands a clear specification of intended functionality, border cases and clear demarcation lines of what must not happen. With today level of requirements engineering and test methodology we are far away from trusted AI-systems.

In such cases requirements traceability ensures that requirements are properly tracked, verified, and validated throughout the development cycle. It is perceived as highly necessary and demanded by all standards along functional safety and cybersecurity. However, in practice traceability is not maintained, and most software systems today are insufficiently tested [9]. Here are some ways in which AI can help with requirements traceability:

- Automated tagging and categorization: AI can be used to automatically tag and categorize requirements based on their type, priority, and other characteristics. This can help to ensure that requirements are properly tracked and easily searchable.
- Natural language processing: AI can be used to analyze natural language requirements and identify potential issues, such as ambiguous or conflicting requirements. It can also help to identify missing requirements or inconsistencies in the requirements documentation.
- Predictive analytics: AI can be used to analyze historical data and predict the likelihood of certain requirements being implemented successfully. This can help to identify potential risks and prioritize requirements accordingly.
- Testing automation: AI can be used to automate testing processes and ensure that each requirement is properly tested and verified. This can help to reduce the time and effort required for manual testing and improve overall testing accuracy.

The return of generative AI in connecting requirements engineering and testing comes in different currencies, namely less effort for maintaining traceability, higher product quality by test case updates even across heterogeneous tool chains, and better understanding of complex systems. The risks of generative AI remain as mentioned in the article. Be aware of your intellectual property rights and never upload software to external platforms. Do not take results of generative AI as sufficient to automate quality checks, because these tools are neither deterministic nor explainable in their chain-of-thought.

The search for a relation between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and corporate financial performance (CFP) can be traced back to the beginning of the 1970s. Scholars and investors have published more than 2000 empirical studies and several review studies on this relation since then. The largest previous review study analyzes just a fraction of existing primary studies, making findings difficult to generalize. Thus, knowledge on the financial effects of ESG criteria remains fragmented. To overcome this shortcoming, this study extracts all provided primary and secondary data of previous academic review studies. Through doing this, the study combines the findings of about 2200 individual studies. Hence, this study is by far the most exhaustive overview of academic research on this topic and allows for generalizable statements. The results show that the business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded. Roughly 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation. More importantly, the large majority of studies reports positive findings. We highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP appears stable over time. Promising results are obtained when differentiating for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, regions, and young asset classes for ESG investing such as emerging markets, corporate bonds, and green real estate.

Keywords: second-order meta-analysis; vote-count studies; financial performance; ESG criteria; business case

# Introduction

Close to 60 trillion US Dollars in assets under management – or 50% of the total global institutional assets base – are currently managed by Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) signatories (PRI 2015a). On the one hand, this development clearly demonstrates the commitment of financial markets toward environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria within investment decisions. However, on the other hand, far-reaching shifts of mainstream investors toward embracing sustainable investment practices remain rather slow (Reynolds 2014; Busch, Bauer, and).

Orlitzky 2015; PRI 2015b). Less than a quarter of investment professionals consider extra-financial information frequently in their investment decisions (EY 2015) and just about 10% of global professionals receive formal training on how to consider ESG criteria in investment analysis (CFA Institute 2015). For many, the business case for responsible investing seems not obvious (Feri 2009; Cohen et al. 2011; Riedl and Smeets 2015). Still, the question of how compatible ESG criteria are with corporate financial performance (CFP) has remained a central debate for practitioners and academics alike for more than 40 years.

Though there are many positive examples for the ESG–CFP relation, researchers often claim that results are ambiguous, inconclusive, or contradictory (Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Rowley and Berman 2000; van Beurden and Gössling 2008; Hoepner and McMillan 2009; Revelli and Viviani 2015). Scholars and practitioners are, in particular, undecided about the general effect including its measurement and durability (Barnett 2007; Devinney 2009; Wood 2010; Orlitzky 2011; Borgers et al. 2013; Orlitzky 2013; Reynolds 2014; Authers 2015). Thus, there is an ongoing debate about the role and the impact of the financial sector on the natural environment and society (Weber 2014). In order to derive a more comprehensive picture, several review studies summarize primary ESG–CFP studies. Yet, all these first-level review studies provide an incomplete picture. This study is the first effort to provide aggregated evidence based on more than 2000 empirical studies that have been released since the 1970s (see Figure 1).

We chose a two-step research method to analyze existing review and primary studies. First, we include findings from so-called vote-count studies. Vote-count studies count the number of studies with significant positive, negative, and nonsignificant results and “votes” the category with the highest share as winner (Light and Smith 1971). These studies provide interesting insights, but are less sophisticated from a methodological point of view. The shortcomings are well documented in the literature. 1 Second, we aggregate the findings of econometric review studies – so-called meta-analyses – to derive a second-order meta-analysis.

In total, 60 review studies – both vote-count studies and meta-analyses – with a gross number of 3718 underlying studies on the empiric relation between ESG criteria and CFP provide the starting point for our second-level review study.2 When adjusted for overlaps, this figure reduces to a net number of more than 2200 unique studies. This still represents a dataset, which is 35 times.

larger than the average of analyzed primary studies in prior review studies. In this study, we explain both systematic methods of summarizing extant research and present a research symbiosis of vote-count studies and meta-analyses in the spirit of a best-evidence synthesis (Slavin 1986).

Through analyzing what is by far the most comprehensive dataset on existing ESG–CFP research to date, we find that the business case for ESG investing is empirically well founded. Investing in ESG pays financially. Furthermore, we highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP is stable over time. Based on the data, we are able to derive conclusions for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, 3 different asset classes, regions, and categories of E, S, and G. Particularly promising results are obtained when we differentiate between regions, nonportfolio studies, and asset classes other than equities.

# Data

Since the earliest review of vote-count ESG–CFP studies (Aldag and Bartol 1978), the studies providing secondary analysis of this relation has risen considerably, including both academic and numerous additional practitioner papers. The growth in number of ESG–CFP research publications has been particularly tremendous since the beginning of the 1990s. Based on our sample, we find that at least 2200 empirical ESG–CFP studies exist.

# Search

For our analysis, only academic studies – regardless if they are working papers, published journal papers, or written for a commercial audience – were considered. Review papers that did not provide quantitative summaries of their findings were not included in our sample. Besides ancestry research and expert opinion, all relevant scholar databases and publisher sites were searched: Academy of Management Journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Sprinker Link, and Web of Science. We also searched for nonpublished material on Econbiz, NBER, Repec, and SSRN. The keyword search combinations included the three components of E, S, and G and its abbreviations. In particular, we used the search terms environment(al) (performance), social (performance), responsib(le/ility), sustainab(le/ility), human capital, (corporate) governance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance.

The first 100 hits of each single database and key word query, sorted by relevance, were further processed. Within this pre-filtered results we then searched for the terms meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. Together with the expert opinion studies, this yielded a narrower sample of 149 studies, which were analyzed in more detail by abstract or full paper. Single study designs, narrative reviews without clear tables/explicit summary results, and review studies without relevant ESG–CFP categorization were excluded. We applied a definition of ESG that reflects the exemplary list of variables of Clarkson (1995), Wood (2010), and the investment approaches in GSIA (2013). We did not differentiate whether the motives for ESG performance of the firm are for altruistic or strategic reasons (McGuire 1969; Baron 2001; McWilliams, Siegel, and Wright 2006). CFP measures were defined as accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk measures, and the performance of ESG portfolios (Cochran and Wood 1984; Orlitzky and Benjamin 2001; Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes 2003; Peloza 2009). We also considered specific parts of a study (Viviers and Eccles 2012; Mayer-Haug et al. 2013; Stam, Arzlanian, and Elfring 2014) when its focus was not entirely on the ESG–CFP relation – provided a vote-count estimate or effect size calculation was possible. In case of different versions of a review study, the latest version – or ideally, the published version – remained in our sample. All studies were required to be available in electronic format. The cut-off date for study inclusion was online availability until December 2014.

This table displays all considered vote-count studies for the analysis. Meta-analytical studies with nontransferable or nontransparent effect sizes that nonetheless allow a vote-count analysis were included in the vote-count studies sample as well. Focus “S” and “E” denote a Social (S) or Environmental (E) focus. For studies with combined E and S focus, the order of S and E indicates the relative weight of S vs. E. The labeling “E, S, G” indicates no relative weight within groups. The number of primary studies in each vote-count analysis is denoted N. For vote-count studies with transparent vote-count on primary study, the share of findings is calculated based on this primary information. For all other cases, the reported summary results of the vote-count reviewers are used.

In total, we identified 35 vote-count studies (Table 1) and 25 meta-analyses (Table 2) which combine results from 3718 (gross) primary studies of which 1816 studies stem from vote-count studies and 1902 from meta-analyses. All studies were scaled with a unique identifier in the format author 1, author 2, … , author i (year). Different review author citations formats, citations years of study versions, and author typing errors were normalized. All available statistical

This table displays all considered meta-analyses for the analysis and includes the number of primary studies in each meta-analysis and the corresponding number of observations. Amplifications on the original reported number of included primary studies have been made, if not the entire sample was used. For four meta-analyses not all originally reported number of studies could be verified through data in the provided appendix and for three studies a condensed study set was used. The gross number of studies therefore decreases from 2091 to 1902 studies. Focus “S” and “E” denote a Social (S) or Environmental (E) focus. For studies with integrated S and E focus, the order of S and E indicates the relative weight of S vs. E studies. The indices (a) and (b) for the uncorrected effect size r indicate the source of the effect size in case, it was modified from the originally stated results: (a) transformed from d/g in r and (b) derived from stated corrected study results with either a meta-analysis provided individual attenuation factor or a calculated artifact attenuation factor of 0.72.

Summary information of review studies and all information reported on primary study level were imported and normalized for further statistical analysis. Not all primary studies were made transparent by the review authors. Eight review studies containing 929 primary studies (25.0% of the sample) were not identifiable on primary level. This meant that the results were included in the summary effects, but no further analysis on primary study level was possible. Within the remaining uniquely identifiable 2789 (gross) primary studies, the overlap within review studies was subsequently accounted for. The resulting net number of identifiable unique primary studies was n = 723 for the vote-count studies and n = 1214 for the meta-analyses. Of these, 259 studies overlap within the two review approaches – which brought the final number of unique identifiable primary studies in the sample to n = 1678. Those 259 overlapping studies remained within the vote-count studies and meta-analyses sample as separation to one or the other review approach was not possible without losing data granularity.

Based on our sample of unique identifiable studies (n = 1678) and the number of nontransparent studies (n = 929), we estimated that at least 550 studies need to be added for a more complete estimate of the overall number of existing empirical studies on ESG–CFP published since the 1970s. This estimate was adjusted for the various overlaps within the vote-count studies and meta-analyses sample.

# Methods

Two different ways for aggregation of the primary and secondary study results are applied, each with different calculation methods depending on the context. For comparability between results in the vote-count studies and meta-analyses, we compute distributions of outcomes and correlation effect sizes. Besides aggregated summary effects, we provide further fine-grained analysis on sub-group level. Depending on data availability in vote-count studies and meta-analyses, an analysis for different asset classes, regions, categories of E, S, and G as well the relation over time is conducted. When both vote-count studies and meta-analyses offer this information, the more comprehensive primary study sample is chosen. When the sub-sample stems from vote-count studies, the analysis focuses on the distribution of outcomes; when the sub-sample stems from meta-analyses, the focus is on effect sizes.

Raw correlations, corrected correlations, sample sizes as well as corresponding variances, standard errors, confidence interval (CI), and credibility interval (CrI) have been extracted from the original meta-analyses as far as possible for further calculations. If necessary, some of the effect sizes and variances were transformed or derived for the calculation of a second-order meta-analysis.

# Calculation of distributions

# Vote-count studies

Distributions of positive, negative, neutral, and mixed outcomes are calculated for vote-count studies based on the results of the gross study sample and the net study sample. Within the gross study sample, it is possible that the same primary study is analyzed multiple times by different review study authors who may interpret each study differently. These interpretations are treated as independent study outcomes – no further adjustments are made. When a primary study is analyzed by more than one review author, the net study sample is adjusted for this constraint and different review authors’ interpretations are harmonized. On average, every unique primary study in the vote-count sample is analyzed by 1.8 review authors. To decide on the overall interpretation per unique study, a binomial test with three equally probable outcomes is applied (positive, neutral, and negative). A probability of greater than .95 served as cut-off point to determine the final interpretation for the study. If no clear positive or negative assignment was possible, the study is classified as neutral and/or mixed.

# Meta-analyses

Vote-count reviewers provide an assessment of the extent to which an observed relation in a primary study is a significant outcome. When undertaking a meta-analysis of primary studies, this assessment is performed by the second-level reviewer. In order to adjust for significance of the results, we employ a 95% CI and 95% CrI based on the determined meta-analytical variance in the n = 25 meta-analyses. We calculate the 95% CI via the determined standard error (SE) for attenuated (r) and disattenuated (p) results.

SEr = √ns = √∑i2ri and SEp = √np2

CIL = 0 + 1.96(SEr/p) and CIU = 0 + 1.96(SEr/p)

The 95% CrI is then calculated via the standard deviation of the attenuated and disattenuated correlations.

SDr = √ns = √∑i2ri and SDp = √np2

CrIL = 0 + 1.96(SDr/p) and CrIU = 0 + 1.96(SDr/p)

The true variance for *r (the meta-analytical mean of attenuated correlations) is s2r = r and the corresponding variance for p (the meta-analytical mean of disattenuated correlations) is s2p*. As we are interested in the degree of significant positive and negative results, we place the intervals around zero instead of the meta-analytical mean. The resulting distributions may appear unusual on first glance as they define results significantly different from zero. The calculation is also conducted for the uncorrected and corrected correlations in the 551 primary studies, which possess transparent effect size data. We apply the same corresponding intervals that are utilized for the set of meta-analyses. Finally, we determine the number of studies that are above and below the intervals, categorize them as positive or negative and put them in relation with the sample size. All studies within the interval are classified as neutral.

# Calculation of effect sizes

# Vote-count studies

Even though vote-count studies usually do not report effects sizes like standardized mean differences (d/g) or correlations, it is possible to approximate them with the provided data. Methods have been introduced during the time when broader application of meta-analytical techniques were being developed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hedges and Olkin 1985) and were further refined in the 1990s (Bushman 1994; Bushman and Wang 1995). The effect size *r is determined by calculating the ratio of p0 (r), which divides the number of positive studies by the sum of positive and negative studies, and by putting it in relation with the corresponding number of studies n. The estimation for the correlation coefficient r of a single vote-count study is subsequently determined through linear extrapolation based on the correlations coefficients provided (Hedges and Olkin 1985, 63ff). In a final step, the estimated correlation factors per vote-count study are sample-size weighted and aggregated to an overall estimation of the average correlation r* for the vote-count sample.

# Meta-analyses

First-order meta-analytical results for the sample of primary studies are calculated with the Hunter–Schmidt approach (Hunter, Schmidt, and Jackson 1982; Hunter and Schmidt 2004). The approach is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al. 2011). It is similar to the second-order meta-analytical methodology which applies a fully random effect model.

All other average effect sizes and summary statistics of the 25 meta-analyses are determined with Schmidt and Oh’s method for second-order meta-analysis (Schmidt and Oh 2013). A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of methodologically comparable and independent first-order meta-analyses. It allows knowledge aggregation across a tremendous set of primary studies. Such a meta-analysis sample is potentially closer to a complete set of studies in certain research fields and allows for robust generalizations. Apart from the efficient aggregation of huge datasets, the method is statistically superior to other approaches for summarizing first-order meta-analyses. Conventional approaches will most likely provide inaccurate estimates of the true mean effect size and are prone to second-order sampling errors in the variances across all meta-analyses. The approach chosen considerably reduces the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows a better estimation of the true (nonartifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes (Schmidt and Oh 2013). Because of the considerable number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample which make use of artifact distribution correction, we calculate our results with the artifact distribution approach of Schmidt and Oh.

In order to differentiate whether correlations and corresponding variance are first-order (based on extracted primary studies) or second-order (aggregated vote-count studies or meta-analyses), we add one or two lines above letters for attenuated correlations r and disattenuated correlations p. The applied circumflex accent indicates that the values in the meaning of psychometric meta-analysis are estimates of the parameters, not the parameters themselves (Schmidt and Oh 2013; Schmidt and Hunter 2015, 229). Correlations containing lines above the letter but not marked with a circumflex are meta-analytical averages but are not determined using a psychometric meta-analysis.

# Results

Figure 2 displays our summary of findings: approximately 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation, of which 47.9% in vote-count studies and 62.6% in meta-analyses yield positive findings with a central average correlation level in studies of around 0.15. The following paragraphs discuss the findings in more detail.

|share of positive findings|share of negative findings|weighted correlation level r in studies|
|---|---|---|
|62.6%|6.9%|0.146|
|47.9%|8.0%|0.150|

Figure 2. Overall summary results.

# Summary effects: distributions

# Vote-count studies

In a first step for the analysis of distribution results, all 1816 vote-count studies in the gross sample are treated as unique studies without adjusting for overlap among the vote-count studies. The overall weighted share of positive findings in the sample is calculated at 48.2%. In 41.0% of all results, the findings lead to neutral (23.0%) or mixed findings (18.0%). Just 10.7% of all analyzed studies exhibit a negative ESG–CFP relation.

In a second step, we account for the amount of nondisclosed and overlapping studies among the gross number of 1816 studies. The transparent studies are netted and in case that the first-level reviewer assessments differ, the findings are synthesized with a binomial test. The additional check does not meaningfully change the distribution of the positive and neutral findings (47.9% and 22.5%, respectively). However, a proportion of the negative findings cannot be considered statistically significant anymore if two or more reviewer interpretations are synthesized with a binomial test. The share of negative findings in the sample decreases to 6.9% of studies. Instead, the share of mixed results increases to 22.7%. Either way, depending on which of the two approaches (unadjusted gross studies/net studies adjusted with binomial test) is applied, close to 50% of all analyzed studies in the vote-count sample find a positive relation and around 10% a negative one. The small distribution difference in the results is explained by a slightly more comprehensive overall sample and the net approach for study interpretation when more than one reviewer analyzed the same primary study.

# Meta-analyses

Out of the 25 meta-analyses in the sample, just one study displays a summary effect size that has a negative ESG–CFP correlation – albeit very close to zero (Revelli and Viviani 2015). The sample size adjusted share of absolute positive correlation findings in meta-analytical summary effect for the 1902 studies stands with 95.8% considerably higher than in vote-count studies. However, this number is not adjusted for statistical significance. If we apply the 95% CI and 95% CrI, for the meta-analytical summary effects and the number of transparent primary studies, the figures change accordingly.

|For the 25 meta-analyses, the share of positive findings is|For the 25 meta-analyses, the share of positive findings is|

This table outlines the results of the distribution analysis of positive, negative, and neutral results in meta-analyses and in dependency of different correlation intervals. Whereas CI indicates the confidence interval and CrI the credibility interval.

Reduced to 74.9% (95% CrI, attenuated results). However, the share of negative results remains at 0%, as the lowest effect in the 25 meta-analyses is –0.003. A quarter (25.1%) of the sample effect sizes is within the CrI and is correspondingly classified as neutral results.

To eliminate potential positive biases in these meta-analytical summary effects, we also drill down to the primary study level and the sample of 551 studies. The share of studies with significant positive correlations is reduced to a minimum of 62.6% (95% CrI, attenuated results) with a maximum percentage of negatives as high 14.5% (95% CI, disattenuated results). An attenuated correlation level (interval) above 0.141 would be needed to bring down the percentage of positive correlations to the level in the vote-count studies of 47.9%. This cut-off is close to the population unweighted average correlation of 0.159.

# Summary effects: correlations

# Vote-count studies

Next, an approximation of the correlation effect size in vote-count studies based on the vote-count method of Hedges and Olkin (1985, 47ff) is conducted. The weighted average correlation rv= in all vote-count studies is calculated at 0.146. The corresponding p-value of <.001 indicates a correlation factor highly significant and different from zero. The additional check for statistical power (Cohen 1988; Faul et al. 2007) reveals that for the determined rv= and the corresponding number of n, the chance of a Type II error is close to zero.

# Meta-analyses

For reasons of comparability with the vote-count effect size estimate rv=, we compute the attenuated sample-size weighted average correlation for the 25 meta-analyses. The calculated correlation rm= is 0.118. The p-value of similarity of rm= and r= is notably high at 0.638. This means vote-count studies and meta-analyses determine statistically comparable results for the ESG–CFP relation. However, generalizing this finding for both methods universally may not be appropriate due to the almost independent samples containing few overlaps and very different variance levels.

Next, we calculate the first-order meta-analytical averages as both uncorrected and corrected parameters for the transparent sub-sample of 551 primary studies. The correlation ri is determined at 0.119 and pi at 0.169. The meta-analytical second-order effect size for the 25 meta-analyses.

combining 1902 gross studies reveals a correlation of ri = 0.108 and for the corrected effect size pi = 0.150. Worth mentioning is that the value for the vote-count effect size rv = 0.351 is statistically not different from the first- and second-order meta-analytical results (minimum p difference to ri). Even though the vote-count technique is a rough estimate based on simplified assumptions, it nonetheless yields surprisingly comparable estimations of the ESG–CFP relation compared to the sample of meta-analyses aggregated with the method for second-order meta-analysis – at least for our setup.

The p-values for all of our meta-analytical means are below .01 and indicate a statistical highly significant positive deviation from zero. In a similar manner, the 95% CrI of 0.058–0.242 for pi is another indicator of the positive nature of the ESG–CFP relation. Moreover, the control for statistical power of these values reveals very robust results, with a Cohen’s power for all figures above 0.8 and in four cases close to 1.

# Portfolio studies and nonportfolio studies

All previous vote-count and meta-analysis effects contain a blend of nonportfolio and portfolio studies. Making this differentiation is important as aggregated firm performance in virtual portfolios and financial products such as mutual funds or indices may deviate from primary firm data. Several primary portfolio studies and corresponding reviews report an abnormally low level of positive findings. And vice versa, a high level of mixed findings, compared to nonportfolio studies (Bauer, Koedijk, and Otten 2005; Peloza 2009; Kleine, Krautbauer, and Weller 2013; Revelli and Viviani 2015). In order to differentiate between portfolio and nonportfolio effects, we deconstruct all distributions and summary effect sizes with sufficient sample size in both blocks of study groups.

The relevance of this distinction becomes apparent when looking at the vote-count studies. The share of positive results in the n = 155 identifiable portfolio-related studies shrinks.

# Table 4. Effect size in dependence of aggregation approach and sample.

This table depicts first-order and second-order meta-analytical results. Attenuated correlations are marked as r and disattenuated correlations as p. The number of lines above letters indicates the first- or second-level nature of the effect size. The additional circumflex accent indicates psychometric meta-analytically effect sizes. Correlations not marked with a circumflex are meta-analytical averages but not determined with psychometric meta-analysis. rv is the sample-size weighted second-level effect size in vote-count analyses and rm the sample-size weighted second-level average effect size in meta-analyses. ri and p are the second-order meta-analytical attenuated and disattenuated averages. The deviation of all effect sizes from ri and p are the attenuated and disattenuated first-level effects sizes in transparent primary studies, and s2 is the estimated true variance for ri and p. Power 0.05 is Cohen’s power with α = 0.05 zero is tested for significance. For the second-order meta-analytical correlation means pi and ri CI L/CI U symbolize the 95% CI and CrI L/CrI U the 95% CrI. L indicates the lower and U the upper bound of the interval. Fail-Safe N is Rosenthal’s (1979, 1991) statistic to detect potential publication bias in meta-analyses. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level. A level above 5*n + 10 for Fail-Safe N is considered unlikely to assume publication bias within studies. This can be ruled out. The significance thresholds for p-values are ***p < .01.

# Figure 4.

ESG–CFP relation in vote-count studies in dependence of portfolio- and nonportfolio sample.

Considerably (15.5%) in comparison to nonportfolio-based studies (56.7%). Studies with neutral or mixed findings increase proportionately in portfolio-based studies and constitute nearly three quarters. The share of negative studies increases marginally compared to nonportfolio studies (11.0% vs. 5.8%) (Figure 4).

Comparable results are found when all portfolio-focused vote-count studies are separately analyzed based on estimated effect sizes. The studies exhibit a negative correlation rv(p) = -0.061 in comparison to the 30 primarily nonportfolio-focused vote-count studies with rv(non-p) = 0.177. The difference between both groups is highly significant (Table 5). These conclusions are supported when the first-level meta-analytical results in the transparent primary studies are deconstructed. The differences in correlations are not so pronounced, nonetheless significant (Table 5). This distinct deviation of portfolio and nonportfolio findings is examined in more detail in the “Discussion” section.

# Sub-effects in asset classes

Aside from the overall distribution of results and correlation factors in vote-count studies and meta-analyses, the data allow for examinations of differences in asset classes (D’Antonio, Johnsen, and Hutton 1997; Bhojraj and Sengupta 2003; Eichholtz, Kok, and Quigley 2010) – although with limited availability of nonequity classes. In a sub-sample consisting of 751 gross and 334 net studies within the vote-count sample 87.1% analyze equity-linked relations.

In contrast, nonequity asset classes both for bonds and real estate display a considerably higher share of positive findings over equities. More than two-thirds of studies uncover significant positive performance relations to ESG criteria. The share of positive votes for the 36 analyzed bond studies stands at 63.9% – with 13 neutral or mixed findings (36.1%). The relatively young research field of green real estate studies is reflected with seven studies in the total sample. Five studies (71.4%) find a positive and the other two a neutral relation (Figure 5).

# Sub-effects in ESG categories

A key question is whether any of the three ESG letters may have a dominating effect on CFP. Some meta-analyses find significant positive relations for corporate environmental performance and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014). Human capital-focused meta-analyses (Combs et al. 2006; Crook et al. 2011; Rosenbusch, Brinckmann, and Bausch 2011) also find highly significant positive correlations. Various review studies on multifaceted corporate governance aspects and its relation to CFP exist and also support a positive relation (Dalton et al. 1999; Gillan and Starks 2007; Love 2010). However, not all of the E-, S-, and G-specific findings are free from ambiguity and no large-scale comparison between the subgroups has been undertaken yet.

For our sample of vote-count studies with identifiable ESG categories in 644 studies, we determine a relatively even positive relation for E, S, and G. The highest proportion is found in G with 62.3% of all cases. Governance-related aspects, on the other hand, demonstrate also the highest percentage of negative correlations with 9.2%. If the share of negative findings is deducted from positive ones, environmental studies offer the most favorable relation (58.7–4.3%). Studies with a social focus show 55.1% (5.1%) positive (negative) outcomes, hence the weakest relation.

Figure 6. E, S, and G categories and their relation to CFP (vote-count studies sample), n = 644 net studies.

When reviewing studies with various combinations of ESG criteria, 35.3% report positive (respectively 7.1% negative) findings. The downside bias primarily arises from a high proportion of portfolio-based studies in this section (39.1%). If all these studies were excluded, the positive (negative) rate stands at 51.7% (4.8%) which is nonetheless lower than pure E, S, and G approaches (Figure 6).

# Sub-effects in regions

Some studies have analyzed potential differences in the ESG–CFP relation across regions. Though findings are far from consistent, some hypothesized that the ESG–CFP relation across countries is particularly affected by a higher humane orientation (del Mar Miras-Rodríguez, Carrasco-Gallego, and Escobar-Pérez 2015). Others find that the ESG–CFP relationship for US assets is significantly higher compared to non-US assets (Allouche and Laroche 2005; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013). In contrast, a few researchers also discover significantly higher effects for studies conducted in the rest of the world (Albertini 2013; Golicic and Smith 2013).

We detect two main patterns in the data based on 843 gross studies with disclosed regional identifier that are netted for a final sample of 402 studies. First, developed markets excluding North America exhibit a smaller share of positive results. This contrast is most apparent between North America (42.7% positive) and developed Europe (26.1% positive). Developed Asia/Australia possess a positive share of 33.3%, though with the largest share of negatives as well at 14.3%. The total sample excluding North American stands at 27.8% positive share. A check of the underlying studies reveals a larger share of portfolio-based studies within the European and Asian/Australian sample that potentially biases the data. However, when omitting all portfolio studies for the developed market samples, the positive ratio for North America increases to 51.5%, and for Europe and Asia/Australia combined to 45.6%. This implies that the previous gap between the two samples shrinks considerably – from 14.9 to 5.9 percentage points.

Second, the Emerging Markets sample shows, with 65.4%, a considerable higher share of positive outcomes over developed markets. Excluding the proportion of portfolio studies, the ratio increases further to 70.8%. Based on 52 single studies in Emerging Markets solely focused on equity-linked studies, the spread to developed markets is considerable (Figure 7).

# ESG effect over time

The question has been raised of whether the ESG–CFP relation is stable over time (Grifﬁn and Mahon 1997; Borgers et al. 2013). Theoretically, the increasing amount of UN PRI signatories and, presuming an increasing ESG awareness within investment strategies, a decreasing ESG alpha (shrinking correlations over time) would be expected due to learning effects in capital markets.

stakeholder issues also lead to changing ESG–CFP patterns over time present a fuzzy picture (Pavie and Filho 2008; Rubera and Kirca 2012; Albertini 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014) (Table 2).

Out of the 1214 primary studies in meta-analyses, 551 studies possess transparent correlation coefficients and publication years. For this sub-sample, we do not find indications to support the learning hypothesis. Although the dispersion of effects, positive and negative alike, increase since the beginning of the 1990s, the aggregated picture stays unchanged. Besides simple observations of the regression line, the time-invariant relation is supported by various trend tests which all fail to detect a time-dependent change of the correlation factors for every year since the mid of the 1990s (Figure 8).

# Discussion

Both vote-count and meta-analytic studies yield comparable results. This is a surprising outcome since the underlying studies are comprised of nearly independent samples (12.9% overlap) and apply different methods. Both methods yield robust results which reinforces the claim that there is a business case for ESG investing. On the one hand, the effect size-transformed vote-count results do not overestimate effect sizes for our sample and lead to comparable results measured as correlation r in comparison to the meta-analytical studies (r = 0.146 vs. mean correlation in meta-analyses between 0.108 and 0.169). Vote-count studies produce, on the other hand, more modest estimates for determining the proportion of positive and negative findings compared to meta-analyses. The share of neutral/mixed results is potentially overestimated for vote-count studies. Vote-count reviews determine whether the effect per study is significant by narrowly focusing on the underlying primary study sample size. Meta-analyses, by contrast, average effects across the entire sample of underlying studies which reduces the meta-analytical mean variance. Smaller variances mean lower thresholds (lower correlations) for significance in meta-analyses.

While overall correlation averages between 0.108 (r = ) and 0.169 (p = ) could be considered rather “small” (Cohen 1988, 1992), they reflect common effect sizes in social sciences (Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota 2003; Tamim et al. 2011; Lipsey et al. 2012) and, notably, might have relatively high relevance for competitive global securities markets. Based on correlation factors and the distribution analysis of more than 2000 empirical studies, we feel confident in generalizing that ESG criteria and CFP are, on average, positively correlated.

The distinct positive empiric result is found across various approaches, regions, and asset classes – except for portfolio-related studies. This outlier is potentially the source of the widespread misperception on the ESG–CFP relation. Institutional and private investors typically conclude that the ESG–CFP relation is, at best, neutral – consistent with the neoclassical understanding of capital markets (Markowitz 1952; Fama 1970; Friedman 1970; Fama 1991). Such an assumption about the ESG–CFP relation can be a key barrier for the broad uptake of sustainable investing among investors and investment advisors (Paetzold and Busch 2014; Reynolds 2014; CFA Institute 2015; Paetzold, Busch, and Chesney 2015).

The realized performance in portfolios depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell et al. 2001; Luo and Bhattacharya 2009), on construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley 2002), and on costs for portfolio implementation (Carhart 1997; Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano 2009) which may distort pure ESG performance. Indeed, we find a significant difference in correlation levels of portfolio and nonportfolio studies. We argue that ESG portfolios should be expected to exhibit lower correlations to CFP and less positive findings for the following three reasons: (1) following the “drowned out by noise” argument (Peloza 2009), various overlapping market and nonmarket factors in a portfolio tend to

cover potentially existing ESG alpha. (2) Most ESG funds constitute a mixture of so-called negative and positive ESG-screened funds, which could result in distortion and cancellation of any remaining effects (Derwall, Koedijk, and Ter Horst 2011). (3) Only studies on portfolios (in particular mutual funds) embed management fees and other costs such as performance fees and trading costs. Observed effects in firm-specific study designs are typically calculated without such fees and costs. As roughly 2.5% per annum in various fees are carried by the average mutual fund (Carhart 1997; Barber, Odean, and Zheng 2005; Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano 2009), real correlation patterns in portfolio studies are most likely distorted. We conclude that portfolio-study findings have to be treated as a specific outcome of a subgroup within the entire ESG–CFP discussion. Investors, on average, are unlikely to harvest the existing ESG alpha after implementation costs. However, it can be argued, sophisticated investors are more likely to do so (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980; Hoepner 2013; Nagy, Kassam, and Lee 2015). Thus, our results underpin previous findings: at the worst case, investors in ESG mutual funds can expect to lose nothing compared to conventional fund investments (Hamilton, Jo, and Statman 1993; Humphrey and Tan 2014; Revelli and Viviani 2015).

Regional findings reveal that within developed markets, there is a higher share of positive results from North America compared to Europe and Asia/Australia. This can partially be explained by the lower share of portfolio studies within the sub-sample for North America. Within the individual E, S, and G categories, E and G exhibit a slightly more positive relation than S-focused studies. However, the difference between E and S studies with positive and negative outcomes is marginal (maximum 4.3% percentage points). Meta-analyses focusing on social aspects (van Wijk, Jansen, and Lyles 2008; Crook et al. 2011; Stam, Arzlanian, and Elfring 2014) usually find higher correlations, in contrast to environmental-focused meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014). We conclude that no single E, S, and G category demonstrates a meaningful superior positive relation to CFP.

The strength of our analysis is the aggregation of a large number of studies through secondary research on review studies, but it is also uncovers the inherit limitations of the underlying studies. One of them is the lengthy academic publication period of primary and likewise secondary research. Although our second-level review study includes all relevant review studies published until the end of 2014, it loses some representativeness for primary studies with a publication date of 2012 and younger.

# Conclusion

Through a second-level review of 60 review studies – including both, vote-count studies and meta-analyses – on the ESG–CFP relation, we are able to combine more than 3700 study results from more than 2200 unique primary studies. Based on this sample, we clearly find evidence for the business case for ESG investing. This finding contrasts with the common perception among investors. The contrary perception of investors may be biased due to findings of portfolio studies, which exhibit, on average, a neutral/mixed ESG–CFP performance relation. It is important to be aware that the results of these (to date about 150 studies) are overlaid by various systematic and idiosyncratic risks in portfolios and, in the case of mutual funds, by implementation costs. Still more than 2100 other – in particular company-focused – empiric studies suggest a positive ESG relation.

ESG outperformance opportunities exist in many areas of the market. In particular, we find that this holds true for North America, Emerging Markets, and in nonequity asset classes. Our results propose that capital markets so far demonstrate no consistent learning effects regarding the ESG–CFP relation: Since the mid-1990s, the positive correlation patterns in primary studies have been stable over time (Table 1).

# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment

Based on this exhaustive review effort, our main conclusion is: the orientation toward long-term responsible investing should be important for all kinds of rational investors in order to fulfill their fiduciary duties and may better align investors’ interests with the broader objectives of society. This requires a detailed and profound understanding of how to integrate ESG criteria into investment processes in order to harvest the full potential of value-enhancing ESG factors. A key area for future research is to better understand the interaction of different ESG criteria in portfolios and the relevance of specific ESG sub-criteria for CFP. These insights will shed further light on the ESG determinants for long-term positive performance impacts.

# Notes

1. The statistical explanatory power in studies is usually low and the primary study might come to the conclusion, based on its calculated significance values and sample sizes, that a certain effect is nonsignificant. Vote-count reviews may also come to biased conclusions by simply concentrating on significant statistics of primary studies to decide if an effect across studies is positive or negative. Potentially they overestimate nonsignificant results. Besides, the explanatory power of vote-count studies shrinks with the increasing number of (contradictory) studies. Meta-studies directly import effect sizes and samples sizes to compute a summary effect across all primary studies. This aggregation method of data could better detect existing correlation patterns in combined samples (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter et al. 1982).
2. The term “second-level review study” describes our aggregation of first-level review studies, regardless if they are vote-count studies or meta-analyses. “Second-order meta-analysis” is the psychometric aggregation technique for first-level meta-analyses as introduced by Schmidt and Oh (2013). This technique is used for the statistical aggregation of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample to compute summary effect sizes.
3. Portfolio studies comprise of studies on long-short ESG portfolios and in particular studies on ESG mutual funds and indices.
4. Two of the typical ways to treat missing data are model-based distribution estimation and the replacement of missing data (imputation) with estimated ones (Schafer and Graham 2002; Tsikriktsis 2005). The latter is applied due to the nonparametric nature of the data. We estimate the total number of missing net studies based on the subgroup means of overlaps in transparent vote-count studies, meta-analyses, and among both. The determined subgroup overlap means are applied to each subgroup of nontransparent studies.
5. The method assumes simplistically comparable sample sizes for the underlying primary studies, which is rather the exception in research synthesis. It is also constructed as fixed effect model, which assumes that studies draw samples from a population with the same standardized mean difference (Hedges and Olkin 1980). The calculated effect size for the vote-count sample should therefore be seen as quick approximate estimate instead of a final analysis (Hedges and Olkin 1985).
6. Please refer to table 1, p. 210 in Schmidt and Oh (2013) for a technical summary of the approach.
7. The applied tests are Pettitt, SNHT, Buishand, and von Neumann. The null hypothesis of the tests verifies if a time series is homogenous between two randomly selected times within the time series. The different tests allow conclusions not only for an assumed normal distribution but also for nonparametric distributions. Only data previous to 1997 are assessed as nonhomogenous to later observations in 2 of 4 tests. The SNHT test detects significantly higher results before 1985. The Buishand test detects significantly higher results previous to 1997 at the .05 level.

# Abstract

Stories about corporate social responsibility have become very frequent over the past decade, and managers can no longer ignore their impact on firm value. In this paper, we investigate the extent and the determinants of the stock market’s reaction following ordinary news related to environmental, social and governance issues—the so-called ESG factors. To that purpose, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Our empirical analysis is based on about 33,000 ESG news (positive or negative), targeting one hundred listed companies over the period 2002–2010. On average, firms facing negative events experience a drop in their market value of 0.1%, whereas companies gain nothing on average from positive announcements. We find also that market participants are responsive to the media, but they do not react to firms’ press releases or to NGOs’ disclosures. Moreover, our results indicate that sector’s reputation mitigates the loss (the goodwill hypothesis) and that cultural proximity and lexical contents of ESG disclosures play a significant role in the magnitude of the impact.

# Introduction

“Even the largest avalanche is triggered by small things.” Vernor Vinge1

Companies are used to coping, almost everyday, with one or several news concerning their social responsibility. Certainly, the debate on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and what should be the firm’s objective(s) is not settled. There are still lively controversies on this question (Portney 2008; Porter and Kramer 2011), but whatever the answer, evidence suggests that environmental, social or corporate governance concerns—the so-called ESG factors—may impact firm value and managers can no longer ignore this.

Recent history provides many instances where bad corporate social responsibility caused huge economic and financial losses. Consider, for instance, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010: 3 months after the disaster, BP had lost half its share value, which represents tens of billions dollars (Smith et al. 2011). Some even reported that, given the size of the company, the oil spill impacted the UK economy as a whole. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 is a dramatic example too. Admittedly, the accident is the direct consequence of the Great East Japan Earthquake, but the extent of the accident is also related to governance failures by TEPCO, whose market value has collapsed (Kawashima and Takeda 2012;

1 The Coming Technological Singularity, 1993.

G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

Lopatta and Kaspereit 2014). Another recent example, albeit much less dramatic, is the Moncler scandal: in November 2014, after a television report showed geese being mistreated while being plucked by jacket makers, the market value of the Italian luxury outerwear company decreased by 6%.

However, beyond anecdotal evidence, we know little about the impact of ESG news on firm value, on a day-to-day basis. Recently, two papers provide interesting insights.2 First, Krueger (2015) studies how stock markets react to positive and negative ESG events and provide evidence that investors respond strongly negatively to negative events and weakly negatively to positive events. Second, Aouadi and Marsat (2016) have investigated the relationship between ESG controversies and firm market value using a dataset of more than 3000 ESG controversies provided by Asset4 Thomson Reuters. They show that higher CSP score has an impact on market value (Tobin’s Q) only for high-attention firms, located in countries with greater press freedom, more searched on the Internet, more followed by analysts, and with an improved corporate social reputation. Thus, these findings provide new insights on the role of firm visibility through which firms can profit from their CSP. These results are appealing and, in this paper, we attempt to contribute to this burgeoning literature.

In this study, we investigate the stock market’s reaction to about 33,000 ESG news from 2002 to 2010 targeting one hundred multinational companies listed among the largest in the world. To that purpose, we use an original dataset provided by Covalence EthicalQuote, a Geneva-based firm specialized in ethical quotation.3 The large number of news allows us to perform a robust-event study. The Covalence classification is used to build a range of variables of interest, such as the type, the source or the region of occurrence of an event. First, we globally examine the direct impact of positive and negative ESG news on firms’ stock market capitalization and the consequences on shareholders’ wealth. Second, we seek to determine whether certain characteristics of the news or of the targeted firm affect this impact. Thanks to the wide spectrum of events, we are able to implement multidimensional regressions to determine the main drivers of abnormal returns and which features have a key impact.

The academic literature on the impact of ESG news is larger, but most of the papers assess the market reaction following a specific event, based on small hand-collected samples without much details. Consequently, they provide little evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or comparison between different events.

Recently, Elayan et al. (2014) have also used data from Covalence EthicalQuote, but they only consider aggregated information. However, their results suggest that these pieces of information convey useful information to shareholders.

The richness of the database allows us to test a broad set of hypotheses. We first set apart positive and negative ESG news and examine a possible asymmetric impact. We also consider whether shareholders’ perception is different whether the news is related to environmental, social or corporate governance issues. Further, we pay attention to the source of the news. Is the impact the same whether the news is published by the media, the firms themselves or NGOs? And do shareholders react differently when the news is published in a financial newspaper or a media devoted to CSR? We also investigate whether the impact of CSR on stock prices has evolved over time, and whether geographic and cultural proximity between events and shareholders matters. We also carry out a content (textual) analysis to characterize more precisely each news. Finally, we test whether the reputation may serve as a “reservoir of goodwill” in times of crisis.

Our results show that firms coping with ESG negative events experience a low but significant drop in their market value. On average, in our sample, the decrease is of 0.1% on a window of 3 days around the announcement. On the contrary, companies coping with positive events do not experience any significant change in their market value. In addition, it seems that stock market penalties do not vary significantly over time, which challenges the conventional idea of a raising awareness on ESG issues. Our results also indicate that sector’s ESG reputation mitigates the loss and that market participants only react to information disclosed by the media and not to firm press releases; in other words, investors do not seem to be fooled by the efforts of companies to appear at their best. Finally, the loss is larger when there is a cultural proximity between shareholders and the event and when the content of a news has a quantitative, an economic or a legal orientation.

This research might have a number of important implications for both shareholders, companies and activists concerning CSR disclosures. Indeed, this paper provides guidance to understand when ESG news are likely to influence firm’s value. This paper also contributes to the literature on greenwashing effectiveness and NGOs influence. Furthermore, our contribution is not limited to CSR issues as our work may be related to the growing body of economic research on how shareholders process information.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. “Related Empirical Papers” section surveys the related literature about the impact of ESG news on stock prices. “Hypotheses Development” section provides some theoretical background and posits a set of testable hypotheses. “A Two-Step Hypotheses Testing Procedure” section describes the data and the variables, while the event study methodology is briefly presented in “Data on ESG News” section. The econometric analysis is implemented in “The

Impact of ESG News on Stock Prices’’ section, and the results are discussed. ‘‘Conclusion’’ section concludes.

# Related Empirical Papers

Several academic papers have aimed at assessing the reaction of shareholders to various types of extra-financial events, in particular events harmful to the environment.4 Most of them focused on public environmental disclosure programs (mainly the US Toxic Release Inventory; e.g., Hamilton 1995), judicial actions following environmental violations (e.g., Karpoff et al. 2005), or industrial accidents causing ecological damages (e.g., Capelle-Blancard and Laguna 2010). Some academic papers also consider the impact of ‘‘bad’’ social or corporate governance practices on firms’ market value. This includes a very diverse set of events: product recalls (e.g., Jarrell and Peltzman 1985), airline crashes (e.g., Borenstein and Zimmerman 1988), product tampering (Mitchell 1989), corporate fraud (e.g., Karpoff and Lott 1993; Chaney and Philipich 2002), ‘‘unethical behavior’’ (Gunthorpe 1997), social movements and protests (King and Soule 2007) or massive layoffs (e.g., Farber and Hallock 2009). These studies provided salient results and showed, overall, that the market penalty may go beyond the direct cost for the company, although apparently without providing sufficient incentives for corporate executives to behave differently.

A common limit of these previous papers, however, is that they focus on extreme events. Oil spills, industrial accidents, toxic releases, product tampering, corporate frauds, etc., have a significant negative impact: this is a well-established fact. But what about less dramatic events? How do shareholders react to ‘‘ordinary’’ news? This question is important for at least three reasons. First of all, CSR does not consist merely in avoiding ecological or social disasters. Instead, according to its proponents, CSR should be embedded in all corporate operations, at every stage; CSR is a matter of day-to-day practices. Accordingly, everyday events should be addressed to assess corporate social performance. Second, all previous studies focus on few industries (particularly the petrochemical firms) which are prone to extreme events, while all firms should be involved. Specifically, the stock market impact of CSR in services or for high-tech companies is largely ignored, whereas these industries represent a large and growing part of the economic activity. Lastly, the tremendous development of social networks and the speed by which they spread information makes any ordinary event a potential market mover. In the case of Moncler (mentioned supra), it seems that the fall in stock prices has been triggered by algorithmic trading following an avalanche of negative tweets against the company.

The impact of ESG news on firm value on a day-to-day basis has received little scrutiny so far. A first attempt was made by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). In their seminal study, they consider companies listed on the Nyse or the Amex over the period 1985–1991 and examine 22 environmental negative events (oil spill, gas leak, explosion and other incidental pollution) and 140 positive ones (environmental awards) extracted from the Nexis database. On average, negative events yield significant abnormal returns of -1.5% ($0.70 per share), whereas positive events lead to significant abnormal returns of 0.82% ($0.37 per share).

Thereafter, some papers have examined the market reaction to CSR awards and certifications (Jacobs et al. 2010; Lyon et al. 2013), CSR rankings (Takeda and Tomozawa 2008), CSR stock index redefinitional (Capelle-Blancard and Couderc 2009; Oberndorfer et al. 2013), voluntary corporate initiatives (Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011; Yu 2012) or the release of standalone CSR reports (Yu et al. 2013). These papers, however, consider positive news only and secondhand information; they are limited by the small size of their sample, and they are not really suitable to determine what are the key factors influencing shareholders.

More recently, Flammer (2013) has extended the approach initiated by Klassen-McLaughlin with a sample of 117 eco-friendly events and 156 eco-harmful events extracted from the Wall Street Journal over the period 1980–2009. Unsurprisingly, she finds that announcements of eco-harmful corporate behavior lead to negative abnormal returns (-0.65%) and that eco-friendly corporate initiatives generate positive abnormal returns (0.84%). She also provides additional interesting insights. Her results suggest that companies have been increasingly penalized for irresponsible behavior toward the environment over time and that shareholders of firms with stronger environmental performance react less negatively to the announcement of eco-harmful behavior. Yet, this paper focuses on a single dimension of CSR, considers only major events and is still limited by the small size of the sample.

Finally, the only paper that examines the relationship between CSR and stock price with firsthand events on all CSR dimensions and with a relatively large database is Krueger (2015). This paper, which has been carried out in

G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

parallel, is the one whose approach comes close to ours. In his paper, he considers 2116 negative and positive ESG events concerning 745 different firms between 2001 and 2007. The data are extracted from the KLD database. The results confirm that negative news are followed by a stock price decrease, while the impact of good events is positive only in cases of poor stakeholder relations. One of its main contributions is the content analysis which shows that investors react more strongly to ESG news containing strong economic and legal information content.

All these results are appealing. However, the main drawback of most of these studies is the relative small size of the samples used. Indeed, they usually relied on hand collection and coding of news content, which automatically restricted the sample size. Consequently, most of the papers simply assess the market reaction following a specific event and cannot provide much detail. Very few papers provide evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or provide any comparison between heterogeneous events.

# Hypotheses Development

It is virtually impossible to open the business section of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, or any business publication today without seeing mention of measures being taken by some company to become more ‘‘socially responsible’’. – Paul R. Portney (2008)

In the media, stories about CSR have become very frequent over the past decade. This statement is confirmed by Fig. 1 which reports the number of occurrences for the wording ‘‘corporate social responsibility’’ in the newspapers. The query is based on online archive collections provided by Dow Jones Factiva (it covers all major newspapers and publications in the world; that is, more than 10,000 news sources including major publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, etc.). Both in absolute terms (the raw number of occurrences) and in relative terms (as a percentage of the number of articles which mentioned the word ‘‘finance’’), the occurrence of the CSR concept is growing quickly, and now it is quite common.

ESG news are increasingly popular and newsworthy. Information on CSR is likely to make good stories, and it is reasonable to consider that soft news on ESG issues and the emotive language associated are more appealing for a large audience than hard information on company’s financial statements for instance.

Extensive media coverage might also be explained by the fact that ESG news are ‘‘blue-compatible’’. Empirical evidence suggests that Democrats (the ‘‘blues’’), in contrast to Republicans (‘‘the reds’’), are more apt to support causes such as environmental and labor protection, and they are more supportive of the stakeholder theory. For instance, Hong and Kostovetsky (2012) find that mutual fund managers who make campaign donations to Democrats hold less of their portfolios in industries that are deemed socially irresponsible (based on KLD ratings). Moreover, news media seems to be biased toward liberal ideas; see Groseclose and Milyo (2005) for empirical evidence from the USA. All together, this is consistent with the heavy weight news media give to ESG issues.

Does it pay to be good? There is an extensive academic literature on the relationship between CSR and firms value, using a wide variety of empirical methodologies (event studies, impact on Tobin’s Q or firm profitability, portfolio analysis, etc.). While these studies provide mixed results, most of the surveys (including several meta-analyses) suggest a positive correlation between CSR and measures of firm performance, such as profit (Margolis and Walsh 2003; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Scholtens 2008; Margolis et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2016).

From a theoretical perspective, however, as pointed by MacWilliams and Siegel (2000), marginal costs and benefits of CSR should offset each other in equilibrium, and consequently, the relationship between CSR and financial performance should be neutral. Moreover, the fact that ESG news are more and more frequent does not mean that they have a significant impact on firms’ market value. Being a media hype is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for being a market mover. ESG news are often considered as soft news. This is a clear advantage to attract media attention and readers, but at the same time, it is somehow a drawback from the investors’ point of view, because soft news are more difficult to process (Demers and Vega 2010). Thus, for instance, Orlitzky (2013) challenges the conventional wisdom about the net benefits of CSR and argues that ESG news may harm stock markets: ‘‘market signals about CSR [are] full of, and in fact generating new, noise because of (a) the ambivalent impact of CSR on an organization’s economic performance and (b) information asymmetry in financial markets, resulting in large part from managerial opportunism (p. 240).’’

Thus, the common view is that ESG news impact firm value, although some doubts have not been allayed. That is, we first test a general but fundamental hypothesis:

# H 1 ESG news have a significant impact on firms’ market value.

The carrot or the stick? Our second hypothesis is related to the (a)symmetry of the impact of ESG news. Previous research in behavioral economics has shown that responses to positive and negative economic information are asymmetric (Schepers 2006).

Historically, investor awareness on ESG issues emerged with the rejection of ‘‘sin stocks.’’ Practices have evolved,

and nowadays socially responsible investors use generally both negative and positive screens. Still, the punishment seems intuitively more powerful and prevalent than the reward (Bird et al. 2007). According to previous studies, it is reasonable to assume that negative news have more impact in magnitude than positive ones. For instance, Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) find that positive stock returns after positive news are smaller, in absolute value, than negative stock returns after negative news. Similarly, Krueger (2015) finds that negative ESG events are followed by a stock price decrease, while the impact of positive ESG events is somewhat ambivalent and depends on the quality of the relations between the firms and their stakeholders. Note, however, that Flammer (2013) finds a significant effect, both for eco-friendly and eco-harmful corporate behaviors.

So, does it pay less to be good than it costs to be bad? As stated by Mattingly and Berman (2006), positive and negative social actions are both empirically and conceptually distinct (see also Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). In particular, ESG-positive events are more diverse in nature, while ESG-negative events are likely to be more compelling.

# H2

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is larger for bad news, compared to good news.

Public relations and watchdog NGOs It is expected that shareholders pay more attention to what they see as the most neutral source of information. As such, we expect that the media would be more influential, both because of their objectivity and their wide readership, relative to less independent sources of ESG news. Accordingly, we hypothesize that news published by the companies themselves (firms’ press releases) or by NGOs have a lower impact on stock price, than news published by the media.

Indeed, to cope with increasing ESG concerns, companies have adapted their communication strategy. In particular, they disclose more and more information concerning their social responsibility. Obviously, it raises the question of the relevance of such news disclosures in a context of informational asymmetries. On the one hand, companies have a clear informational advantage but, on the other hand, the credibility of firms’ announcements is low given that they have an interest to distort information to their own benefit.

While there is a growing theoretical literature on greenwashing and ESG disclosures (Baron 2005; Lyon and Maxwell 2011), empirical evidence on the effectiveness and the impact of such strategies is missing. A similar issue arises with NGOs. NGOs engage in private politics (Baron 2001), trying to influence firms’ ESG practices. They have two main choices. They can either work directly with firms and highlight ESG improvements or report bad ESG practices (Lyon 2010), to influence medias and consumers. With the recent rise of public awareness on ESG issues, several NGOs choose to focus on public information campaigns rather than lobby the government (Yu 2005).

Are advocacy NGOs able to impact stock prices? Is collaboration (by disclosing positive ESG news) more efficient than denunciation (bad news)? Several papers have cast doubt on NGOs influence, and there are growing debates on collaboration between.

Interestingly, Zyglidopoulos et al. (2012) find that more media attention leads to an increase in CSR strengths, but does not drive any significant change in CSR weaknesses. Yet, this is still consistent with our hypothesis suggesting that it is more expensive for firms to improve their weaknesses, than to enhance their strengths.

NGOs and corporations (Yaziji and Doh 2009), which could lower NGOs credibility (Gibelman and Gelman 2004). To our knowledge, there is no impact assessments other than case studies (Spar and Mure 2003; Doh and Guay 2006). We attempt to provide insights on these issues by testing whether the impact of ESG news varies according to the source.

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is larger when it comes from the media, compared to the firms themselves or NGOs.

# Media visibility and specialization

In practice, shareholders do not give equal importance to all sources. In particular, it is expected that disclosures of the leading financial newspapers have a larger impact. For instance, Huberman and Regev (2001) have shown that the market might react sharply to a news published in The New York Times, even if the information has been already reported in various popular journals or newspapers (Nature, Times, etc.). Conversely, it is likely that shareholders who value ESG issues scrutinize specialized media dedicated to CSR. All together, this leads to two non-exclusive hypotheses.

# H 4a

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is larger when it comes from leading financial newspapers.

# H 4b

# Main Environmental, Social or Governance issues

It seems, a priori, quite natural to separate environmental, social and corporate governance issues when testing whether one particular dimension of CSR has more importance for shareholders. However, there is no theoretical underpinnings and it appears to be mostly an empirical issue. In this respect, the literature on Socially Responsible Investing might provide some information: there is preliminary evidence of superior returns for portfolios based on employee relations (Edmans 2012) and corporate governance (Barnett and Salomon 2006; Renneboog et al. 2011), but we should be cautious in generalizing these findings. It seems more appropriate to consider the effect at a sectoral level. The impact of ESG news might be larger when the event is associated with a main concern for the firm.

As stated by Caroll (1979), the issues that business must address largely differ depending on the industry. Different industries face different problems and external pressure might vary accordingly (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). For instance, environmental issues are undoubtedly more important for the Oil and gas sector than for the banking sector.

# H 7

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is lower in times of economic crisis.

Reputation The theoretical literature on the effect of reputation on financial performance is somewhat inconclusive. On the one hand, Jones et al. (2000) and Werther and Chandler (2005) argue that CSR may serve as a “reservoir of goodwill” in times of crisis. Accordingly, we can expect that firms with good reputation experience a lower decrease of their market value after the disclosure of negative ESG news. On the other hand, Baron and Diermeier (2007) and Baron (2009) state that companies with highly visible CSR activities face increased public scrutiny.

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

and may experience a ‘‘boomerang effect’’ in case of dis- disappointment. This is empirically conﬁrmed by Luo et al. (2012): while BP was regarded as the ‘‘greenest’’ company in the oil industry, and Exxon as the ‘‘brownest,’’ BP accidents were more likely to be reported than Exxon accidents. Kim et al. (2014) ﬁnd that CSR performance is negatively associated with future stock crash risk, which also supports the mitigating effect of CSR. Theoretically, the two approaches are equally relevant and nothing came to our attention that suggests that the goodwill effect should be stronger or weaker than the boomerang effect.

Further, it should be paid attention to the way the reputation is deﬁned. Rennings et al. (2007) point out that results may signiﬁcantly differ depending on whether the ﬁrm’s reputation is computed in respect with their industry peers or not. Empirically, they found that only the ﬁrm’s absolute reputa- tion has a signiﬁcant impact on shareholder wealth. Accordingly, we consider two versions of the goodwill hypothesis.

# H 8a

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms in sectors with good ESG reputations.

# H 8b

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms with good ESG reputations in comparison with their peers.

Greenwashing If reputation serves effectively as a reser- voir of goodwill, it might be very tempting for a ﬁrm to appear at its best and to mislead shareholders. Such strategies are usually referred to as greenwashing, that is, the selective disclosure of positive and negative information by the ﬁrm on ESG issues. Like reputation, the impact of greenwashing is theoretically ambivalent. As stated by Lyon and Maxwell (2011), ‘‘although companies naturally want to publicize their environmentally friendly actions, they are often sur- prisingly hesitant to promote their environmental successes or to issue detailed environmental reports. Part of the reason appears to be that activists react more angrily to ﬁrms that lay claim to being virtuous, and then are discovered to have feet of clay, than to ﬁrms that never make such claims.’’ Empirically however, since there is extensive evidence of greenwashing, it suggests that ﬁrms have a net interest in this (unless one considers that they do not know where their advantage lies).

# H 9

The impact of negative ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms which are prone to greenwashing.

‘‘Watch your words, for they become actions.’’ Recently, several studies have shown the importance of news media content in explaining stock price variations. These works, initiated by Tetlock (2007), aim to study the impact of qualitative verbal information on shareholders. For doing so, they used content analysis (also referred to as textual analysis), which can be deﬁned as a set of methods that seek to describe in a systematic and quantitative manner the content of a text. Although the method has been used frequently in social sciences, it has become prevalent among economists only recently. We propose to build on this approach to capture some speciﬁc features of the ESG news (Krueger (2015) has followed a similar approach).

We focus here on four criteria based on the Harvard IV-4 and Lasswell Value dictionaries: economic, legal, qualita- tive and quantitative. Qualitative information is naturally more difﬁcult to process than quantitative one, and there is evidence that information with high processing costs dif- fuses slowly into asset prices. Moreover, it is likely that ESG events with a legal or economic ori- entation will have a larger impact on stock prices.

# H 10a

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger when the articles contain words referencing to eco- nomic or legal orientations.

Out of sight, out of mind? Tavares (2003) shows that the amount of foreign aid is decreasing with the geographical and cultural distance between giving and receiving coun- tries. Engelberg and Parsons (2011), who examine earning announcements in the USA show also that the impact of media on ﬁnancial markets is inﬂuenced by the distance. Accordingly, we investigate whether the proximity between a company and where the event takes place inﬂuences the impact of ESG news on shareholders behavior and ﬁrms’ market value.

# H 11

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger for local events or for more proximate geographi- cally or culturally events.

The next sections will present the procedure used to test these assumptions, and how we proxy the main character- istics of the targeted corporations and the features of the news that may shape investors’ sentiment and inﬂuence the impact on stock price.

# A Two-Step Hypotheses Testing Procedure

To test our set of hypotheses, we investigate the extent to which ESG news affect ﬁrm’s stock price. We proceed in two steps (as King and Soule 2007; Capelle-Blancard and Laguna 2010; Flammer 2013; Krueger 2015). First, we

# G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

assess the direct impact of ESG news on stock prices using the event study methodology. Then, we aim to determine whether certain characteristics of the news or the firm might explain stock price variations.

# The Event Study Methodology

Event studies examine the behavior of stock prices around corporate events. This methodology is widely used to measure shareholders’ reaction to all kinds of unexpected news (Kothari and Warner 2006). The underpinning of event studies is the efficient market hypothesis (Fama et al. 1969), which states that as new information becomes available, it is fully taken into account by shareholders. Accordingly, stock price changes reflect, to some extent, the discounted value of current and future firm’s cash flows. In practice, the basic idea is that shareholders’ reaction to a specific information can be measured by comparing the observed return to the return that we would expect in absence of any firm-specific event; this difference is called the “abnormal return.” If investors react (un)favorably to an event, we would expect (negative) positive significant abnormal returns. The strength of this approach is that it is based on the overall assessment of many investors who quickly process all available information in assessing firm’s market value. Moreover, this approach reduces reverse causality concerns which might appear when one examines the correlation between CSR and accounting measures of firm performance, such as profits.

Formally, we follow the approach defined by MacKinlay (1997) and consider the Market model (augmented with a sectoral index) to predict returns. Hence, for each event, abnormal returns are computed as follows:

ARij;s;t = Rj;s;t - E(Rj;s;t) = Rj;s;t - bj - bjabRm;t - bRs;tcj

where ARij;s;t measure the shareholders’ reaction to the event i targeting the firm j, which belong to the industry s, at time t. Rj;s;t is the observed return for the firm j, Rm;t is the corresponding market return and Rs;t the corresponding sectoral return. The parameters aj, bj and cj are estimated over a 60-day window ([-70, -11]).

As usual, abnormal returns are aggregated over (2n + 1)-day periods around the event: n days before to catch possible insiders information, the day of the event and n days after. It leads, for each event, to cumulative abnormal returns (for n = 1; ...; 5):

CARij;s;t[n; +n] = Σs=t-n ARij;s;s

To test hypotheses 1, 2 and 3, we separate ESG news between good news and bad news and according to the source (media, firms and NGOs). Then, for each category, we compute average abnormal returns (AAR = ARi) and cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR[n; +n] = CARi[n; +n]) and use statistical analysis to test the significance of our results (see MacKinlay, 1997). Stock market data are from Datastream.

# Regression Specification

In addition to assessing the direct effect of ESG news on stock price, we aim to determine whether certain characteristics of the event or the firm affect abnormal returns. To this end, we use a regression-based approach. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

CARij;s;t[n; +n] = a + b Trendt + C0Xi + K0Yj;t + dj + hs + ei;j;s;t

where CARij;s;t[n; +n] is the cumulative abnormal return for the event i, occurring at the date t, targeting the firm j, which belongs to the industry s, over a centered (2n + 1)-day window (Eq. 2). Trendt is a linear monthly trend. Xi is a vector of variables related to the event and Yj;t is a vector of variables related to the targeted firm at time t. dj and hs are firm and industry fixed effects, respectively. ei;j;s;t is the error term. We use White heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The coefficients of interest are b, C and K which capture the characteristics related to hypotheses 4 through 11. Definition and sources of the variables are presented in the next section.

Alternative specifications (with or without the sectoral index or with the CAPM) lead to very similar results. The most serious concern is about confounding events. While there is an extensive literature on the event study methodology, the contamination of the estimation period (Aktas et al. 2007) or the event period (Nelson et al. 2008) has attracted little attention. The standard approach consists in using a case-by-case analysis to neutralize all the confounding events, but this approach is impractical for large samples. In our case, we know precisely the dates of the possible confounding events (not all of them, but the ones related to ESG news). Then, we provide a robustness check in order to tackle the problem of confounding events. We consider another estimation window (-130, -11) where confounding events included in the Covalence EthicalQuote database are neutralized. In other words, for each firm, the days surrounding ESG news (-1, 0, +1) are dropped from the estimation window. The results are qualitatively the same (see in “Appendix” section). But the contamination by non-ESG events of the estimation period or the event period remains a possible limitation of this study.

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

Data on ESG News are valuable. However, unlike Elayan et al. (2014), we do not consider aggregated data, but we examine the impact of every piece of ESG news.

The potential number of ESG news to examine is huge: dozens are published almost every day for each firm, either by the media, NGOs, consultants or the firms themselves. Therefore, in order to assess the financial impact of these information we need a very large database. Furthermore, each piece of news should be sufficiently comprehensive and precise to analyze what drives the market reaction.

Most of the time, to conduct an event study, academics compose their database by collecting events from newspapers archives. In recent years, online search engines have facilitated this collect. Still, there is a huge amount of work to process the events, which usually limits the size of the database. Thus, until now, most event studies consider, at best, hundreds of events.

In this study, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Created in 2001 in Geneva (Switzerland), Covalence EthicalQuote has developed a systematic collect of positive and negative ESG information concerning the world’s largest companies. The range of ESG news is very broad. Positive news includes, for instance, announcement of a social sponsoring program, the launch of new eco-innovative product, a green award, etc. Negative news goes from toxic release disclosure to rumors of downsizing, through the disclosure of bad labor practices in subcontractor factories, etc.

According to Covalence EthicalQuote, each day 20 analysts perform a total of 80 h of reading, screening 2000 news items (in English, Spanish, German and French). As of 2010, their database includes more than 190,000 information items from more than 10,000 sources, covering a universe of more than 500 companies. Covalence EthicalQuote uses its database to feed its ethical reputation scoring system. For each firm, the score is computed by aggregating positive and negative ethical news. Then, the scores, the rankings and some specific reports are sold to various agents like banks (Barclays, BNP Paribas, HSBC, etc), companies (Coca-Cola, HP, Nokia, etc.) and NGOs (Gain, MSF, WWF, etc.). The main advantage of this database is its comprehensiveness. Moreover, contrary to sustainability ratings, the information is firsthand.

Recently, Elayan et al. (2014) have shown that the Covalence EthicalQuote data convey some useful information to investors. Indeed, they find a causal relationship between stock market reaction and Covalence quarterly press releases, which indicate changes in the ethical score of the firms. Their results reinforce our idea that these data.

9 See ‘‘Appendix’’ section for some examples of ESG news collected by Covalence EthicalQuote.

# The Sample

Covalence provides us a sample of 126,365 ESG news items from January 2002 to December 2010. These news involve 100 listed firms which belong to the Dow Jones Sector Titans indexes (the complete list is provided in ‘‘Appendix’’ section). Some news items are related to the same event, occurred on nonbusiness days, or are poorly specified (either the nature, the event or the source of the news is missing). Consequently, these news are dropped: this leaves 65,881 events (52% of the sample). Moreover, several news may occur for the same firm on the same day, making impossible any interpretation of the market reaction. These news are dropped also, leaving a total of 33,067 ESG news (26% of the initial sample), positive or negative. This represents, on average, three ESG news per firm every month. The total number of news per firms varies approximately from 150 to 600, with a standard deviation of 110. The complete distribution is presented in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.

For each news, we know the name of the firm, the announcement date and the source. Covalence classifies ESG news into a large number of different sources that we aggregate into three categories. We consider that ESG news may come from: (i) media (including internet) and official authorities (governmental bodies, academics, international organizations), (ii) NGOs and trade unions or (iii) the firms themselves. Moreover, Covalence classifies the news into 45 criteria depending on the topic considered (see the detail in ‘‘Appendix’’ section). We group them into three broad criteria: (i) environment, (ii) social and (iii) governance.

|Source|Positive News|Negative News|
|---|---|---|
|Media|84%|84%|
|Firms| | |
|NGOs| | |

This first table gives us some interesting insights. First, the main provider of ESG news is the media which disclose about 84% of the news, firms and NGOs equally sharing the rest. Moreover, the proportion of news by source is approximately the same whether one considers environmental, social or corporate governance issues. Second, our sample of news is well balanced in terms of ESG criteria even if there are slightly more news related to social issues (39% overall), than news on corporate governance (34%) and the environment (29%). Third, the part of ‘‘good’’ news relative to ‘‘bad’’ ones is very skewed.

| |Total|22,391|10,676|2682|166|18,751|8869|1070|1677|

This table documents the number of negative and positive ESG news included in the sample, categorized by source (the firms, the media, the NGOs) and topic (environment, social and governance). One hundred firms are considered (see the list in ‘‘Appendix’’ section) over the period 2002–2010. Data are from Covalence EthicalQuote. Given that some events have been reported by several sources and/or are related to several ESG issues, the total number of news is lower than the sum of the categories.

The number of positive news is two times larger than the total number of negative news. More precisely, the ratio of positive to negative news is 3.1 for environmental news, 1.8 for social issues and 1.5 for corporate governance. Unsurprisingly, firms are the most prone to announce good news: positive news announced by the firms themselves are 16-fold larger than negative news. ESG news from media are also biased toward positive news with a ratio slightly below two. On the contrary, NGOs disclose almost 50% more negative than positive ESG news.

# Definition of the Variables

As we argued above, certain factors are likely to be associated with the effectiveness of ESG news. These factors could be classified into three categories. The impact of ESG news will depend on the nature of the news (the type, the origin, the tone, etc.), the strength of external pressures (the long-term trends, the economic environment, etc.) and the characteristics of the targeted firm (its reputation, its sector, its financial health, etc.). We describe below how we computed the variables which serve as proxies. Descriptive statistics are provided in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.

# ESG Issues

We created three dummy variables E, S and G that are set to one if the news is related to environmental, social or corporate governance issues, respectively. Note that these dummy variables are not exclusive since some information involve several issues.

# Sources

We created a set of dummy variables to distinguish news from the media, from the firms themselves and from NGOs (hypothesis #3). Further, we consider three dummy variables. The first one ‘‘Main newspapers’’ is equal to one when the news was published in one of the ‘‘Top 200 Newspapers in the world.’’ The second one, ‘‘Financial newspapers’’ is set to one when the news was published in a newspaper with a business or financial orientation (Financial Times, Business Week, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg.com, etc.). The last one ‘‘CSR newspapers’’ is equal to one when the news was published by a media specialized in CSR (Ethical Corporation Magazine, CSRwire, GreenBiz.com, etc.) (hypotheses #4a & #4b).

# Sector’s Main Concern

The relevance of ESG news is likely to be different depending on the activity of the firm: Environmental news, for instance, have certainly a different meaning for a petrochemical firm and a bank (hypothesis #5). To capture this, we created a dummy variable equal to one when the news is related to the ‘‘main concern’’ of the firm targeted. The main concern is defined at the industry level, based on the relative percentage of E, S and G news. Firms are classified into six industries: Banks, Basic Resources, Chemicals (including health care), Consumer goods and services, Industrial goods, and Technology. Unsurprisingly, environment is the main concern for ‘‘Basic Resources’’ and ‘‘Chemicals,’’ social issues are the most important for ‘‘Consumer goods and services’’ and ‘‘Industrial goods,’’ and corporate governance is the main stake for ‘‘Banks’’ and ‘‘Technology.’’

# Trends

Our regressions include a linear monthly trend from January 2002 to December 2010 (hypothesis #6).

These lists have been manually checked. The complete list (with more than 1000 sources) is available on request.

For example, the percentage of bad ESG news published by the media on environmental issues is equal to 7% for the banking industry and to 35% for the chemical industry. Conversely, the percentage of bad ESG news published by the media on corporate governance issues is equal to 24% for the banking industry and to 11% for the chemical industry (see Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017).

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

use Google Insights for Search between 2004 and 2010 to capture public attention (Da et al. 2011). Google Insights for Search provides insights into the search terms people have been entering into the Google search engine. In this study, we use the keyword ‘‘economic crisis’’ (hypothesis #7) and extract a weekly index. The value of the index is lower than 10 until September–October 2008, when it jumps to 100 in few weeks with the failure of Lehman Brothers. Since then, the index declines regularly toward 20 at the end of 2012.

# Reputation

We proxy CSR reputation, for each firm or sector, by the number of positive ESG news over the total number of ESG news (positive and negative) published by the media (hypotheses #8a & #8b). We calculate this ratio on the year preceding each event to have a rolling measure compatible with companies’ fixed effects. As we want to test simultaneously sectoral and idiosyncratic reputation’s impact on abnormal returns, the firm reputation is defined in comparison to its peers. The latter is a measure of the relative good reputation of a firm compared to the average reputation of a sector. That is, sector reputation is defined between 0 and 1, while firm reputation is defined between -1 and 1.

# Distance

We implement a first indicator of the distance between the country where the event takes place and the firm’s country of origin by considering the logarithm of the distance between the two countries. We implement also a dummy variable equal to 1 if the country where the event takes place and the firm’s country of origin have a common official language (hypothesis #11). Data on geographical and cultural distance are from the CEPII.

# Size

We control for the size of the firms using total assets (in logarithm). A priori, two opposite effects could play a role concerning the influence of the size on the impact of ESG news. On the one hand, investors may be more sensitive to ESG news concerning large firms (Aouadi and Marsat 2016), but on the other hand, the shares of small firms are less liquid, and their reallocation possibilities are weaker. We use also the Price Earning Ratio as a control variable.

# Greenwashing

To assess greenwashing (hypothesis #9), we compute the percentage of positive ESG news disclosed by a firm (or a sector) over the total number of positive ESG news related to this firm (or sector). As for the reputation, we designed a time frame of 1 year preceding each event to have a rolling measure. The greenwashing variable is between 0 and 1 at the sectoral level and between -1 and 1 at the firm level.

# The Impact of ESG News on Stock Prices

# Event Analysis of CAR

We investigate whether the tone of the articles matters (hypotheses #10a & #10b). To quantify this, we rely on four tag categories of the Inquirer dictionary (including the).

12 An alternative would be to use the Volatility Index (VIX) computed by the CBOE and based on the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index options. Often referred to as the fear index, it shows a very similar pattern.

13 We also used the Fortune Magazine’s annual ranking of the ‘‘world’s most admired companies.’’ A problem, however, is that it does not cover all the firms included in our sample. Moreover, according to McGuire et al. (1988), Fortune Magazine’s ranking is linked to prior financial performance.

14 We also used a 6-month and a 2-year time frame for robustness tests, but it does not change the results.

To test the hypotheses #1 and #2, we assess the statistical significance of average abnormal returns by setting apart negative and positive ESG news. Then, to test hypothesis #3 we repeat the analysis separately for ESG news published by firms, media and NGOs. Table 2 presents average abnormal returns (AAR0) and cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR½ 1;þ1 and CAAR½ 5;þ5), with the corresponding standard deviation in parentheses, for each.

15 We only consider news in English.

16 R&D spendings (divided the total assets) and percentage of floating shares have been used also, but the availability of the data (moreover, only annual) lowers the size of the sample without changing meaningfully the results.

This table presents the average change in firm’s market value around the publication of ESG news, from least squares regressions (using White-corrected standard errors). Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. AAR½t¼0 is the average abnormal return the day of the publication, CAAR½ 1;þ1 and CAAR½ 5;þ5 are the cumulative average abnormal returns over 3 and 10 days, respectively, around the publication. The estimation window is ½ 70; 11. Figures are in percent. Data on ESG news are from Covalence EthicalQuote. The sample is composed of 100 companies considered between 2002 and 2010. *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, 1% level respectively.

Overall, ordinary ESG disclosures impact firm’s market value, but mainly negatively. In support of hypothesis #1, the cumulative average abnormal return in a 3-day (10-day) event window is -0.085% (-0.139%) for negative events and +0.016% (+0.035%) for positive events for the full sample. The magnitude of the impact is low, but it is significant at the 1% level for negative events; in contrast, as stated in hypothesis #2, the average change in firm’s market value around the publication of positive ESG news is barely significant. Accordingly, while shareholders seem to penalize bad corporate social responsibility, they do not really reward positive behaviors. Figure 2 shows the daily cumulative average abnormal returns over a 20-day time window around the publication of negative or positive ESG events. This figure clearly illustrates the significant declines in stock price for firms that were targets of negative ESG news. Meanwhile, the trend for positive ESG news is unclear. This asymmetry is in line with most of the previous literature (except Flammer 2013). Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn (2011) even find that voluntary certifications such as Climate Leaders and Ceres generate market penalties. Thus, ESG investments are not always perceived as profitable by the stock markets.

Note that this first set of results holds when we consider alternative specifications: with a restricted sample that excludes events for which abnormal returns are likely to be misspecified (i.e., when parameters of the market model are jointly not significant), with or without sectoral indexes, with a longer estimation window cleaned of contaminating events, or with the Fama-French 4 factors. Those results are available on request.

The only source of ESG news that seems relevant for shareholders is the media (hypothesis #3). Negative ESG news disclosed by the media generate significant losses. In a 3-day (10-day) event window, these news caused cumulative average abnormal returns of -0.092% (-0.137%), which represent an average loss of $0.25 ($0.37) per share. Not surprisingly, firm’s press releases are not market movers. Most striking, albeit consistent with some concerns about their lack of credibility, the financial impact of ESG news published by NGOs are not significant. Confronted to a profusion of competing daily news, investors may react strongly to a disclosure that is not genuinely new (Huberman and Regev 2001). NGOs’ disclosures may influence media information (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017), while only media information directly influence investors. Considering this, the indirect impact of NGOs on stock markets remains a potential field of research.

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

Subsequently, given the previous findings, we only consider negative events published by the media and the event windows that catch the best the impact on the stock markets ([-1;?1] and [-5;?5]).

# Regression Analysis of CAR

Table 3 shows the results of several models regressing changes in firm’s market value related to negative ESG news published by the media, on a set of independent variables capturing certain characteristics of the news or the targeted firm. Changes in firm’s market value are expressed as a percentage variation from expected returns over a 3-day period (CAR½ 1;þ1) and a 10-day period (CAR½ 5;þ5). Columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 include company fixed effects to capture idiosyncrasies. We measure the impact of sectors’ and companies’ reputation and greenwashing with the past disclosures on their ESG activities. As we are mostly interested in analyzing the effect of reputation and greenwashing between firms and sectors, we do not include these variables in specifications including company fixed effects. Therefore, columns 3, 4, 7 and 8 only include HQs’ country fixed effects. All regressions include White-corrected robust standard errors.

# Source

The nature of the media has very little influence on the magnitude of the shareholders’ reaction to negative ESG news, which is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis (hypothesis #4a for leading financial newspapers and #4b for CSR specialized media). Nevertheless, this question should be further investigated, with more specific data on sources, to study the dynamics of information reports by different sources.

# E, S, G?

The literature did not provide clear ideas on what dimension of CSR should be, a priori, the most important for shareholders. Our results suggest that the average impact of negative ESG news is similar whether it concerns environmental issues, social issues or corporate governance issues. We hypothesized also that the impact of ESG news might be larger when the event is associated with a main concern for the firm (hypothesis #5). The effect is not significant, and it appears that shareholders attach as much.

Table 10 in ‘‘Appendix’’ section only considers cumulative abnormal returns significant at the 1% level. Table 11 uses a larger estimation window ½ 130; 11 which is ‘‘decontaminated’’ (the days when a firm experiments ESG events were removed from the estimation windows).

We do not find that the coefficient on the time trend is significantly negative (i.e., the loss gets stronger over time). While the number of ESG news covered by the media has increased (see Fig. 5), the perception of ESG events has not really changed during the last decade. External pressure to become socially responsible is similar, and firms have not been increasingly penalized by shareholders when they experienced negative ESG news (hypothesis #6). This result might appear inconsistent with Flammer (2013), but remember that we consider only 8 years (2002–2010), while Flammer (2013) considers three decades (1980–2009).

We also posited that shareholders’ attitude toward ESG news might be impacted by the crisis (hypothesis #7). We do not find any significant impact, either positive or negative.

# Past Disclosures: Reputation and Greenwashing

Our results suggest that a sector’s ESG reputation could act as a shield against potential shareholders’ losses (hypothesis #8a). Indeed, the more positive the past media coverage on a sector’s ESG issues, the lower the loss due to a negative ESG news. This confirms the ‘‘reservoir of goodwill’’ hypothesis, at a sectoral level at least. The result is barely significant when considering firm’s reputation compared to its peers (hypothesis #8b), which is in line with most of the previous literature.

Are firms able to mediate the impact of adverse ESG events by disclosing their own positive ESG news (hypothesis #9)? The answer seems to be yes: the more ESG communications firms issued in the preceding year, the lower the impact of negative news on stock market performance. Public relations, which could include greenwashing, are useful to reduce the direct financial penalties in times of trouble. However, the long-run dynamics of the strategic interactions between companies, NGOs and the media are ambiguous and should be the subject of further investigations. Public relations influence shareholders, but.

Similarly, we also tested whether upcoming weekend (the so-called Friday effect) or holidays distract shareholders from ESG issues (DellaVigna and Pollet 2009), but we did not find any impact as well. We have also controlled for the total amount of news reported in the Dow Jones Factiva database (therefore, including non-ESG news), which can be considered as a proxy of limited attention of shareholders (Hirshleifer et al. 2009); the results were not significant.

This table reports results from least squares regressions (using White-corrected standard errors). Reputation and greenwashing are calculated on a 1 year window preceding each event. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. The estimation window is ½ 70; 11. The sample is composed of 100 large companies between 2002 and 2010. Data on ESG news are from Covalence EthicalQuote. *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, 1% level respectively.

firms which claim to be virtuous are more scrutinized by the media and the watchdogs, which could be double-edged.

# Content Analysis

As expected, the tone of the articles clearly influences the impact of ESG news on firms’ market value (hypotheses #10). We find that articles including quantitative words tend to be associated with larger losses. The impact is also amplified when articles include an economic vocabulary, albeit to a lower extent. The literature has already shown that the content of financial news influences the stock markets (see for example Schumaker and Chen 2009, or Kogan et al. 2013). Our results confirm recent findings (Krueger 2015) highlighting the relevance of content analysis of extra-financial news.

# Out of Sight, Out of Mind?

Cultural distance affects the impact of ESG news (hypothesis #11). Previous papers have shown that within a country, investors overweight domestic firms20. Heath and Tversky (1991) explain this phenomenon by an aversion to ambiguity where investors infer beliefs from preferences. In line with the literature on the domestic bias, our results suggest that when events take place in countries sharing the same official language with the involved company headquarters, they have more financial impact. Interestingly, the effect of cultural distance is lower when considering the ½ 5; þ5 event window compared to the ½ 1; þ1 event window. This may suggest another interpretation: events occurring in countries sharing less proximity with headquarters have a similar impact, but shareholders take more time to assimilate this information and incorporate it into prices. Note that we did not find such results for the geographical distance.21

# Conclusion

Investors and analysts have access to more information than ever on firms’ behavior toward environmental, social and corporate governance issues. And whether they like it or not, corporate executives have to take into account CSR concerns, if only to improve financial performance and lower risks. This paper examines the stock markets reaction to ESG news gathered in the Covalence EthicalQuote database which includes, after several filters, more than 30,000 occurrences concerning 100 listed companies over the period 2002–2010. It means that we do not only consider extreme events, but also very ordinary events. Our results first point out that shareholders react to the publication of ESG news.

21In a previous version, we tested whether the impact of ESG news depends on the country where the event took place; in particular, we distinguished developed and developing countries. On the one hand, the impact should be higher for negative events if they occur in developed countries compared to developing ones, because of environmental liability rules or the stringency of regulation. On the other hand, due to the difference of media coverage, small events are more likely to be reported in developed countries. We did not observe any significant differences.

# G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

ESG news, but mainly (not to say only) to negative ESG news. While the change in firm’s market value on a window of 3 days around the publication of negative ESG news is about 0.1% on average, the impact of positive ESG news is barely significant. This loss due to negative ESG events is mitigated when the targeted firms have previously disclosed more positive ESG information than their peers and when the sector has a good ESG reputation. In contrast, the loss is amplified when the news has a quantitative and economic orientation, and when there is a feeling of emotional closeness between the event and the firm.

Many directions could be explored to improve this study. The most visible extension could be to implement more sophisticated approaches for the computation and the analysis of abnormal returns. But more fundamentally, there is a lack of information to proxy the extent of the event. As the previous papers on CSR events, we consider all news equally. Indeed, we have no way to distinguish a priori the most striking events. As such, the media audience could be interesting to investigate, considering that the more media coverage, the heavier the financial losses due to negative ESG events. Moreover, if the Covalence EthicalQuote database provides remarkable research possibilities on CSR, it could be improved with systematic and automatic requests. This would allow notably to deepen the lexical analysis with other categories. Finally, it could be interesting to refine the analysis of reputation and greenwashing.

Abstract: Given that corporate leaders seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of their organization, this study explores how a business adopting a Thai Sufficiency Economy philosophy improves its sustainability performance. Adopting the Sufficiency Thinking model as the research framework, this study uses a qualitative research approach with a set of different data collection techniques to explore a sample Small–Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) called Plan Creation. Collected data are identified as themes, according to the Sufficiency Thinking model. Our findings reveal that there is a close fit between the collected data and the Sufficiency Thinking model. Virtuous attributes, individual and shared knowledge and the decision-making framework of Sufficiency Mindset are observed through the sustainable leadership actions, leading to, among other things, social and environmental innovation. Implications for practicing managers and directions for future research are also discussed.

# 1. Introduction

A great number of social scientists globally [1–9] have been on their search since the 1980s for an alternative to the mainstream U.S. business model that opts for maximizing short-term shareholder value, arguably leading to corporate bankruptcy. According to social scientists, the prevailing approach is fundamentally flawed, and does not lead to the wellbeing and happiness that human being desires. What then represents a different option?

Corporate sustainability is defined as “Meeting the needs of firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, clients, pressure groups, communities without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well” [10] (p. 131). In a time of uncertainty and complexity, organizations strive to survive and sustain themselves. In a quest for an approach to do so, several concepts have gained interest from practitioners. In Thailand, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) is recognized as a philosophical approach to sustainable development [3]. A recent bibliometric review [11] has also indicated that the Sufficiency Economy philosophy is a school of thought in Asia on sustainable organization management. Internationally, SEP is also fundamental to the theory of corporate sustainability [12]. However, much is still unknown empirically about the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in business organizations. Thus, the focal research question of this study is how systematically business organizations adopt the Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve their sustainability performance.

Consequently, the present study’s objective is to explore how corporate leaders practically ensure their organizational sustainability. The following section reviews the empirical and conceptual literature.

specifically on the philosophy of Sufficiency Economy. Relevant literature on sustainability performance is also reviewed. Then, the overall research methodology used in this study is described. We proceed by introducing our sample Small–Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) named Plan Creation or PlanToys. We conclude this paper by introducing some important recommendations drawn from the findings for practicing managers and business leaders and future research directions for researchers.

# 2. Background Literature

Knowledge of a whole SEP approach to corporate sustainability is very limited, even though the corporate sustainability topic has gained enormous interest from scholars and practitioners around the globe [ 13 –17 ]. This section presents the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) formulated by His Majesty King Rama IX of Thailand as a whole approach to corporate sustainability. The philosophy is unofficially translated below [7] (p. 128).

“Sufficiency Economy is a philosophy that stresses the middle path as an overriding principle for appropriate conduct by the populace at all levels. This applies to conduct starting from the level of families to communities and to the nation in terms of development and administration, so as to modernize in line with the forces of globalization. “Sufficiency” means moderation, reasonableness, and the need for self-immunity to protect from impacts arising from internal and external change. To achieve sufficiency, an application of knowledge with due consideration and prudence is essential. In particular, great care is needed in the utilization of theories and methodologies for planning and implementation in every step. At the same time, it is essential to strengthen the moral fiber of the nation, so that everyone, particularly public officials, academics, and business people at all levels, adhere first and foremost to the principles of honesty and integrity. In addition, a way of life based on patience, perseverance, diligence, wisdom and prudence is indispensable in creating balance and in coping appropriately with critical challenges arising from extensive and rapid socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural changes in the world.”

His Majesty King Rama IX of Thailand derived the philosophy of Sufficiency Economy from his accumulated wisdom and insights throughout his 58 years of the throne [18]. His Majesty emphasized the “middle” path as the universal principle to life for Thai people at all levels and domains of application. The philosophy allows for a strategy for the nation to balance the national development and to deal with external forces. It emphasizes the requirement for adequate protection from shocks from inside and outside the nation. His Majesty reiterated the philosophy, after the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, in which countless large businesses and SMEs in Thailand went bankrupt, as the national strategy to economic recovery leading to a more resilient economy [ 19 ]. The philosophy is indeed responding to a call among corporate sustainability scholars for a new stakeholder-focus theory of the firm [20–24].

Sufficiency suggests three core principles of moderation, reasonableness, and resilience [7] and two underlying conditions of knowledge and virtues [7]. His Majesty emphasized the necessity of prudence in planning and its implementation, and carefulness in applying relevant knowledge. As for the virtues, Sufficiency Economy demands that people live their lives with the virtuous values of perseverance, harmlessness and generosity. They must adopt the honesty and integrity principles to be sustainable. Comparatively, the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy highlights virtuous values and morality as fundamental to sustainable management, consistent with the Stakeholder theory of the west [25].

Kantabutra et al. [ 26 ] pioneered SEP research into the business organization by qualitatively exploring the corporate leadership practices among publicly listed companies in Thailand. These companies are market leaders and survived major crises. The practices were derived as the Sufficiency Economy Leadership Practices (SELP). The practices, their example supporting tools and techniques, and impact on corporate sustainability [27] (p. 4) are described in Table 1 below.

|Practice Titles|Sufficiency Economy Leadership Practices|Example Supporting Tools/Techniques|Effects on Corporate Sustainability|Relevant Sufficiency Economy Principles|
|---|---|---|---|---|

|8. Resource utilization|Promote effective and efficient utilization of resources.|Percentage of waste; defection rate.|Minimized cost and capacity to compete in the market.|Reasonableness and Knowledge|
|9. Stakeholder focus|Genuine concern for a wide range of stakeholders, including future generations and society, even though doing so increases expenses.|Stakeholder analysis; Stakeholder satisfaction index.|Social crisis prevention and assistance in times of difficulty, ensuring business continuity.|Moderation, Reasonableness and Morality|
|10. Knowledge sharing|Share, including knowledge sharing with competitors, to develop a relevant market and to maximize benefits to consumers and society.|Knowledge sharing policy.|Continuing innovation.|Knowledge and Morality|

Extending the previous research [24,26], a prior study [27] quantitatively examined associations between business practices according to the SEP and sustainability performance, using a sample of 112 Thai businesses. Findings indicate that the practices are significantly predictive of improved sustainability performance. A later study [5] was conducted to confirm these findings in a larger sample of 294 businesses from different industries in Thailand. The latter findings indicate that business practices consistent with SEP improved corporate sustainability performance. These practices were called sharing, geosocial development, perseverance, resilience and moderation, later informing the development of a theory of corporate sustainability [12]. The findings of the previous studies [5, 27] also endorse the prior findings by Kantabutra et al. [26]. In conclusion, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is empirically endorsed as an approach to corporate sustainability.

In 2016, there was a significant development in moving the Sufficiency Economy philosophy forward in the scholarly community. A group of scholars who worked in the SEP areas came together and inductively developed a model called “Sufficiency Thinking” shown in Figure 1 [28] (p. 52) the research framework for the present exploration. The Sufficiency Thinking model describes the theoretical process from virtues to well-being sustainability.

Figure 1. The Sufficiency Thinking model [28] (p. 52).

The Sufficiency Thinking model [28] begins with virtuous individuals which together develop shared virtues in an organization over time. The next model element is the knowledge that individuals bring into the organization, which over time becomes shared knowledge. Virtuous and knowledgeable individuals are not sufficient to sustain an organization. They are required to have a certain mindset to guide their decision-making process in order to respond effectively to the internal and external environments. This mindset is called “Sufficiency Mindset”. Such a mindset is informed by the moderation, reasonableness and prudence principles. Before deciding, one must acquire the necessary knowledge while taking into consideration its consequences on all possible stakeholders. In other words, one must adhere to the ethical and virtuous principles in making such a decision. Next, the behavioral consequence of such the decision-making process is called 23 sustainable leadership practices or 23 work principles. The 23 sustainable leadership practices [29] (pp. 27–36) are adopted in the present study as demonstrated in Table 2 below. More explanations about each of the practices can be found in Avery and Bergsteiner [2].

|Leadership Elements|Sustainable Leadership Philosophy|Shareholder-First Philosophy|
|---|---|---|
|Foundation practices|Sophisticated, stakeholder, social, sharing|Tough, ruthless, asocial, profit-at-any-cost|
|1. Developing people|Develops everyone continuously|Develops everyone selectively|
|2. Labor relations|Seek cooperation|Acts antagonistically|
|3. Retaining staff|Values long tenure at all levels|Accepts high staff turnover|
|4. Succession planning|Promotes from within wherever possible|Appoints from outside wherever possible|
|5. Valuing staff|Is concerned about employees’ welfare|Treats people as interchangeable and a cost|
|6. CEO and top team|CEO works as top team member or speaker|CEO is decision maker, hero|
|7. Ethical behavior|“Doing-the-right-thing” as an explicit core value|Ambivalent, negotiable, an assessable risk|
|8. Long- or short-term perspective|Prefers the long-term over the short-term|Short-term profits and growth prevail|
|9. Organizational change|Change is an evolving and considered process|Change is fast adjustment, volatile, can be ad hoc|

# 3. Methodology

To gain a deep understanding of how a business adopts a Thai Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve its sustainability performance, a qualitative approach is used to explore how corporate leaders ensure organizational sustainability. Figure 2 presents the research methodology process. We start with a literature review relevant to the Sufficiency Economy philosophy and corporate sustainability. The search keywords include sustainability, sufficiency economy, corporate sustainability, social enterprise, and sustainable enterprise without a specific timeframe.

|Literature review|Questions development|Multi-data collection|Data analysis|
|---|---|---|---|
|Observation|Stakeholder interviews|Documentation|Coding adopting the Sufficiency Thinking model|

Then, a set of open-ended questions is developed since we want to explore how corporate leaders practically ensure their organizational sustainability. In order to answer the research question, a case sample of a Thai small and medium enterprise is used. The case sample named “Plan Creation or PlanToys” was purposively selected because this organization has adopted the SEP concept according to Thailand’s Office of the Royal Development Projects Board (ORDPB). Interviewees, including stakeholders, were purposively sampled to provide answers to relevant aspects and questions. Stakeholders were face-to-face interviewed, including the Managing Director, ten department managers, ten employees, three customers and six people living in the nearby communities.

The Managing Director was asked about how he led and managed his organization. The ten department managers were interviewed about the management practices of their relevant departments. The ten employees were interviewed about the business practices and quality of life at work, while the three customers and six people from the surrounding communities were interviewed about their experience with the sample SME. These informants are chosen on a convenient basis. Probing, reflective note-taking, critical incident technique and non-participant observations were used during two visits to the company to improve data validity. All interviews were tape-recorded with permission from the interviewees and from the sample company. All recorded interviews were transcribed into a text-based document. Secondary data from other sources such as media reports and Facebook were also collected.

We adopt the triangulation approach to data collection to ensure an acceptable level of validity and objectivity. In doing so, we concurrently improve the rigor of the present study as it allows us to draw rich data from a set of various perspectives from multiple data collection techniques and different actors from different organizational levels as well as key actors from outside the organization such as external stakeholders.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

# 7 of 19

As for data analysis, qualitative data collection and analysis generally take place simultaneously as researchers try to draw meaning and develop understanding slowly over time in a non-linear manner. By design, we therefore transcribe the interviews by ourselves. We adopt the deductive approach by choosing the framework approach to qualitative data analysis that involves coding the qualitative data based on a theoretically and empirically pre-determined research framework (Figure 2) since we can anticipate the likely responses from the interviewees based on the literature. This framework approach has been used to manage and analyze qualitative data since the 1980s [29] as it helps researchers to focus the coding on those critical issues in the extant literature. The framework approach is also relevant to our cross-sectional analysis with descriptive data as it allows us to see different aspects of the observed phenomena under examination [29]. In doing so, our interpretations of informants’ responses and experiences are transparent [29], and demonstrate the relationship between different stages of analysis [30,31]. With a series of interconnected stages, the framework approach also allows us to move back and forth across the data until we arrive at a coherent account [29].

In fact, we finally convert the research framework in Figure 2 into a working analytical framework to clearly demonstrate the relationship between the Sufficiency Thinking model and received respondents’ answers. As our analysis tool, this working analytical framework as shown in Table 3 comprises a set of codes grouped according to the research framework. The working analytical framework assists us in managing and organizing the data, acts as a new structure for the data, is useful for summarizing and minimizing the data, and supports us in investigating the research question.

# 4. Plan Creation

Plan Creation Co. Ltd. or PlanToys was established in 1981 by seven university graduates with a dream to infuse the world with positive vibes. At that time, the company was led by Vitool Virapornsawan with a strong architectural and design background. At present, the company is run by the second generation, Kosin Virapornsawan, who shares the original vision and mission to create a sustainable world. The written vision of PlanToys is “Better Kids, Better World”, with a belief to run a stakeholder-friendly business. PlanToys has expanded its distribution channel overseas through partnerships in Asia, America, Europe and Australia. Their products are educational toys for kids of all ages, with a large variety of products. PlanToys is chosen as the sample for the present study because the company is endorsed by the three criteria of sustainable enterprise [1]. The company also delivers the cultural, social, environmental and economic outputs and outcomes of self-reliance, immunity and resilience [3].

With over 640 employees and 350 SKUs to toys in 2019, PlanToys has an average annual revenue of 388 million Baht (approximately 12.2 million USD) with a registered capital of 150 million Baht (approximately 4.7 million USD). PlanToys has survived several crises over the past decades, ranging from the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, the subprime crisis in 2008, and the sudden increase in minimum labor wage by the Thai government in 2012. With prudent financial and operational risks management, PlanToys survived these crises by receiving support from employees and all stakeholders without laying off a single employee. PlanToys has a strong brand image. Customers trust the brand and constantly purchase safety toys for their kids, continuously maintaining its market leadership in Thailand.

# 5. Discussions of the Findings

Our findings reveal that many practices at Plan Creation are consistent with the Sufficiency Thinking model. The virtuous values and knowledge are infused throughout the entire enterprise. Evidence is also clear about the corporate Sufficiency Mindset that informs the practices. In the section below, we do not categorize our discussions by the virtuous values, knowledge and Sufficiency Mindset, and sustainability practices in this order. Instead, we present the sustainable leadership practices found at Plan Creation. We also demonstrate in detail how these practices are influenced by the Virtues, Knowledge, Sufficiency Mindset. However, the resulting outputs and outcomes are discussed respectively in this order.

# 5.1. Sufficiency Thinking Practices

Virtues are being practiced at Plan Creation. A practicing virtue at Plan Creation is perseverance that forms a strong company culture, a sustainable leadership practice. Perseverance starts when employees first join the company.

“Most of our new employees are willing to learn the sufficiency thinking concept. Some of them are very enthusiastic and eager to learn new things. We prepare and support them for their career advancement. The company considers their background, performance, perseverance and other skills” (Marketing Officer)

As endorsed by the Perseverance predictor for corporate sustainability [5], perseverance at Plan Creation is a performance appraisal criterion. Performance evaluation is conducted annually, including other criteria as diligence, the ability to focus and deliver values. Perseverance at Plan Creation is seen clearly when it encounters a tough time. In the past crises, a united team of employees who exhibited an organizational citizenship behavior attitude at Plan Creation persisted despite a great obstacle to ensure corporate survival. Certainly, this enhances its corporate resilience.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“At a time of crisis, we needed to reduce operating costs by reducing over time (OT) and to increase employees’ day offs, but there was no policy to reduce the number of staff. The top management team called for a meeting at the canteen to inform the situation to staff. At that time, there were not many staffs resigning. The staffs understood and were committed to ensuring the company’s survival." (HR Officer)

Consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of considered organizational change, Plan Creation constantly adapts to the changing business environment, including new opportunities to expand its market. When a market however is declining, Plan Creation also finds a new market as a replacement. Such a practice is consistent with the long-term orientation practice of sustainable enterprises [26]. In terms of products, Plan Creation always innovate to add values to customers and to ensure sustainable competitive advantage, endorsed by the sustainable leadership practice of innovation. Staff at Plan Creation usually come up with small and continuous innovation, including incremental process improvement and its resulting cost saving. It is clear that the sustainable leadership approach of the long-term perspective improves its corporate ability to immune itself from external shocks.

“Now we need to diversify our business to the new market, for example, toys for elderly, pets, and kids’ furniture. We need to plan for the new marketing strategy. Secondly, we need to change the selling platform. We have started with export, then wholesale and then will do more retail through online channel.” (Managing Director)

“At the factory, there is a machinery development department. Systematically, it is in charge of bringing in innovative ideas to improve production processes and products.” (HR Officer)

Perseverance at Plan Creation also reflects in its attempt to always adjust its standards to meet rising client expectations, consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of quality. They systematically consider and manage change here. Since more and more large clients prefer to set their own criteria for selecting suppliers, Plan Creation needs to be able to meet their demand. These demanding standards include ethical standards, environmental standards and production standards. Thus, “doing the right thing”, is an exhibited behavior among Plan Creation employees. Certainly, this behavior is in line with the sustainable leadership practice of ethical behavior.

“PlanToys products help to support child development very well. I feel very confident in letting my children plays with PlanToys products because it made from the wood with high quality of standards. I would prefer my children playing with wooden toys rather than plastic toys.” (Customer A)

“I have PlanToys on our office desk. When we are stressful, we can play them. PlanToys usually helps us to think of innovative ideas.” (Customer B)

Consistent with the sustainable leadership practices of stakeholder focus, social responsibility and knowledge management, sharing is the next practicing virtue at Plan Creation as demonstrated in its living core values. This virtuous value of sharing impacts many business activities [5] here as discussed below.

“Learning is the key success factor for our company. Our management team has paid attention to sharing. For example, knowledge sharing especially through the use of internet to disseminate PlanToys’ knowledge. The company has a lot of knowledge, but they are all over the place. We actually have an idea to put everything about PlanToys in the website. With the search function, users everywhere can easily search and acquire useful information.” (Managing Director)

Plan Creation really “shares”, as endorsed by the corporate sustainability predictor of sharing [5].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“Employees here have a very kind heart. They are friendly, supportive and considerate. Sharing with others and sharing to the society are one of the most important core corporate values.” (Plant Director)

“We always support each other as it is part of our core values. If we work at Plan Toy and meet other employees outside the company, we always help each other. At PlanToys, everyone is equal. There is no competition among us. We are friends and family.” (HR Officer)

“Externally, we always exchange and share knowledge with people in our community. Every year, there are groups of visitors and students visiting our company. Students are always interested and ask questions. This is considered an imperative way of knowledge sharing.” (HR Officer)

“Internally, not only we provide training to employee, but also on Wednesday morning we have a shared event called “Fresh Up in the Morning” for managers to share new knowledge or new experience for about 15 min. Department managers take turn to speak to all employees.” (Plant Director)

“If any educational institution is interested in learning more about PlanToys, our top management is willing to be a speaker to students because we would like to share our success and failure stories to others. We strongly believe that our knowledge and experience is beneficial to the society. We are happy to share good practices that can further help to develop some sort of good business models for other organizations. We do not prohibit information sharing.” (Marketing Officer)

With a Sharing policy, knowledge is shared throughout the organization, enabling Plan Creation to rely on the organizational system, as opposed to a few individual Gate Keepers. Endorsed by the sustainable leadership practices of valuing people, developing people continuously and long-term employee retention, PlanToys gives its people priority. Avoiding staff layoffs, Plan Creation preserves firm-specific knowledge and skills embedded in employees, most of which have worked for Plan Creation for a long time. During an economic downturn, these firm-specific knowledge and skills have helped the company to get back on track with the market demand in a timely manner, enhancing corporate resilience. Externally, the company supports educational visits. Depending on which aspect Plan Creation shares, the sharing practice has helped the company to develop a stronger capacity to bring about the quadruple sustainability outputs.

“When there is a job vacancy, the company always gives an opportunity to internal staff first. If anyone is interested in this new position, s/he can apply and go through the recruitment process. If we cannot fill in the position with internal staff, then the company makes a job posting and announcement for outsiders.” (Production officer A)

Also in line with the sustainable leadership practice of knowledge retention and sharing, knowledge at Plan Creation, as one of the two basic conditions of the Sufficiency Economy philosophy, is manifested through its living corporate values. Endorsed by the resilience predictor for corporate sustainability [5], knowledge at Plan Creation is exceptional since it results in many innovations. Plan Creation strictly adheres to a manufacturing policy of exceeding customer requirements all the time. It ensures the highest quality and safety and delivers products on time. Technologies are improved continuously to ensure the highest level of cost efficiency so that it can set a competitive price and allow for maximum flexibility. Clearly, quality is part of its corporate culture. For example, the company developed a chemical-free kiln to dry the wood, followed by the use of water-based dyes, non-formaldehyde glue and organic color pigment to ensure the highest safety of toys for kids and for employees in the company.

“We incorporate innovation in our products. Many people ask about the sufficiency economy philosophy. They wonder why we pay attention to innovation which seems to be the opposite of the sufficiency economy. We explain that it is not true. Sufficiency Economy is the philosophy to run business sustainably. To survive in business, we need to differentiate our company. Innovation is the solution to our business. Innovation can be incorporated into design, function, or materials.” (Managing Director)

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

Market analysis is carried out at Plan Creation on a continuous basis to guide innovations to ensure its corporate alignment with the changing market needs. Plan Creation’s innovations are frequently built upon its strong expertise in utilizing local and simple materials. Typically, the company develops a new product from in-house materials, which often means a partial use of its existing manufacturing equipment. Thai wisdom is also a foundation for most innovations at Plan Creation.

“PlanToys located at the downstream of the supply chain. Upstream involved with growing rubberwood trees for latex. After 25 years, rubberwood trees can no longer produce latex. In the past, they were cut and burned. PlanToys is the first company which turns unused rubberwood into toys . . . In terms of product design, the founders of the company paid attention to the design. In designing, we incorporate innovation in our new eco-friendly material which comprises non-toxic composite wood from sawdust and wasted wood to make. This material is called Plan wood.” (Managing Director)

It is evident that the knowledge value influences the innovation practice at Plan Creation. However, knowledge and innovation at Plan Creation benefit not only themselves, but a range of stakeholders including its industry competitors. Plan Creation’s innovation and sharing practices allow the company to continue to incrementally and radically innovate, enhancing its own sustainability prospect.

Plan Creation clearly adopts the moderation principle of the Sufficiency Economy philosophy. Essentially, the moderation principle can be seen in action here, as informed by virtuous values and knowledge at all organizational levels.

“Our products have a small margin. We emphasize on quality, and we invest heavily in quality and safety which is the cause of the very small margin. Fortunately, our products were well sold in the market. Our goal is not only to make profits, but also to keep our employees work happily every day by delivering value to our customers.” (Managing Director)

Adopting the moderation principle, Plan Creation, as opposed to maximizing the wealth of the owners, has increased its sales volume in a “stakeholder-friendly” manner, consistent with the sustainable leadership practices of long-term stakeholder value and independence from financial markets where maximization of short-term shareholder value is the focus. This policy is clearly endorsed by the moderation predictor for corporate sustainability identified [5].

“There was a time when we wanted to double our target growth within the next 3 years. To achieve such an aggressive target, our growth rate must be 20–25% for the first year. We used the price to drive the market. In turn, our sales volume decreased although we provided promotions and discounts. We did not even achieve the target in the first year. From that year, we realized that we should not grow aggressively. Some years, the more we sold our products, the more we made loss. Our sales volume was high, but we made more loss because our capacity was limited. We increased overtime, which in turn led to lower productivity. Finally, it was not worth to do so. Eventually, we rethink how to create a more balance for our company.” (Managing Director)

With the moderation principle, future problems and crises can be prevented or their effects can be minimized since Plan Creation can respond more effectively to them. A prudent practice at Plan Creation is for example a policy to utilizing internal capital to ensure maximum independence to continue its operation both in the short and long run. In doing so, Plan Creation improves its corporate self-reliance. Its current proportion of external sources of capital are 1.9 times of internal source of capital. The company also adopts the moderation principle in its sourcing practice. Plan Creation sources materials timely, given its collective insights in a highly cyclical market and a long-lasting bond with local suppliers. The supplies are kept in a well-maintained warehouse, creating a backup for the company when there is an abrupt change in the supply market. In addition, cash flows are managed very carefully here to ensure a high degree of independence from financial institutions via its long-termed, trusted relationship with the local suppliers.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“Our material is rubberwood from the supplier which is our subsidiary company. We have a high standard and strict requirements not to use chemical in the wood. This chemical-free wood is not easy to find from other suppliers in the market. It has to be made-to-order. We create a standard contract for suppliers which clearly states our requirements.” (Finance Officer)

“The Moderation, Prudent concepts and strategic direction came from the President. The President has driven these concepts for our company not to aim to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, unlike the approach other typical companies usually adopt. For a listed company, the company needs to focus on maximizing profitability for shareholders alone, but our company aims to be “People’s Company”. We would like to provide different things to all of our employees. We do not want the highest sale volumes. Everything shall be optimized. A high revenue may lead to a high cost. Sharing per staff may be less. Employees may have to work more. This will not benefit anyone at last.” (Managing Director)

Adopting the Prudence and Reasonableness principles, Plan Creation invests very carefully. Long-term oriented, Plan Creation invests only in a project that has the potential to deliver benefits in the long run. At a time where a significant investment project is considered, for example, the acquisition of new equipment, the top management team on a consensual decision-making basis needs to choose whether an existing machine can be upgraded or a new one is needed. Usually, upgrading is the most desirable option. Equipment will be acquired only when the existing equipment cannot be adapted or modified, because new equipment usually needs a large investment not only to install it but also to adjust it to fit with the entire existing operational processes and procedures. A well-thought practice such as this permits Plan Creation to maintain lower costs in the long run. Certainly, it enables Plan Creation to always compete better in the market.

In terms of business expansion, typical companies expand to maximize profits. However, business expansion is considered very carefully at Plan Creation. As a team, the company decides to expand only when it is clear to deliver long-term returns. In general, Plan Creation pilots the expansion first. The company continues to invest on a bigger scale only when the initial investment demonstrates a clear likelihood of long-term growth. A prudent development such as this has helped Plan Creation to protect itself from environmental shocks that may have brought about a great difficulty.

“Other competitors went out of business because they did not have a strong brand or did not apply the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in their operations. There was a time when we received a contract from another company to expand our business, but we decided not to expand our factory. Nevertheless, our competitor expanded its business, which hurt them significantly during the (1997 Asian Economic) crisis.” (Marketing Officer)

Manifestly, the Sufficiency Mindset as endorsed by virtues and knowledge has affected the organizational practices at Plan Creation. Endorsed by the geosocial development predictor [5], Plan Creation runs its business with a keen sense of ethical responsibility to the best interests of its broad range of stakeholders. Concurrently, Plan Creation is deeply aware of all possible impacts it can create for the environment. Adopting the sustainable leadership practices of social and environmental responsibility, the company considers integrating the social and environmental responsibility into its business as something that brings a competitive advantage to the company. Obviously, this mindset leads to improving its corporate capacity to deliver the quadruple bottom line outputs.

“PlanToys pays attention to community and well-being of people in neighborhood. The company takes good care of the environment around the factory. We do not have problems of waste water or smell. PlanToys always collaborates with the community; especially if we request or propose any ideas, the company always supports our ideas to improve our environment around the factory.” (Community leader)

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“The company manages the environment and society around factory and community well. We can breathe easily. There was one time, our head of community asked for support in drug testing in people who live in community. The company and employees supported and collaborated well to ensure we lived in drug-free community.” (Villager A)

“We used to request the company to help build a road and dig a canal for our community. The company was happy to help us.” (Villager B)

Plan Creation gives priority to the employees whom it considers as family members, demonstrating amicable labor relations. Consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of internal succession planning, the company prefers insider managers wherever possible to make sure the corporate culture and business operation continue smoothly. Plan Creation heavily invests in leadership development. As a result, employees can replace each other when needed. Without disruption, the company can continue to produce the highest quality products. This is a demonstration of self-reliance and organizational immunity at Plan Creation.

“We happily work and live like a family here. We have handicap staff who are visually impaired and they work here for more than 20 years.” (Staff A)

“I trust my supervisor 100%. She knows everything about me. I can talk to her about my personal life. For example, my child got sick, my debt. The company has a very good system. Other employees can help to support my work during my absence. I used to take 45 days maternity leave. All the work ran smoothly without any problems.” (Production offer B)

To nurture a team culture and to transfer the shared organizational vision, values and culture, a “Buddy” system is set up to pair a new employee with a senior one, consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of strong, shared vision. In such a widely shared corporate culture, employee motivation and productivity are high, enhancing corporate capacity to deliver economic performance.

To ensure the highest safety for its end users, often kids, Plan Creation manufactures its products guided by the top international quality standard via its supply chain. Maintaining a good and trusted relationship with its long-term suppliers, the company source the highest quality supplies and materials. To improve productivity, Plan Creation also recognizes motivation needs among its employees such as healthcare, scholarships for their children. Indeed, a sense of trust and teamwork is created in the organization. These practices assist Plan Creation to improve its organizational capacity to deliver the quadruple bottom line outputs.

“We have a long-term relationship with PlanToys. We received a special request from PlanToys for a special size of wood. PlanToys emphasizes on safety and chemical-free raw materials because this wood will be the toys for kids. Kids may put the toys into their mouth. Therefore safety and quality are the highest concern. We adjusted and improved our production process to ensure the wood is free from moth. We also enhanced our drying system.” (Supplier A)

Adopting the shared virtues, Plan Creation has contributed to the community it operates in different ways. This contribution helps the surrounding community to understand Plan Creation better. Such enhanced understanding helps to prevent a problem such as protesting stemmed from the surrounding community.

“We have regularly organized CSR activities. We promote a reforestation campaign with the community. We also regularly organize a reforestation activity every year by involving people in the community. We act as a role model for people in our community.” (Plant Manager)

“The strength of the company in relation to community is the environmental concern. The company cooperates with the surrounding community. For example, the company provides a health checkup for people who live near the factory. In any special event, like Children’s day, Elderly’s day, the company also organizes activities for the community.” (Employee)

“We arrange “Toy Museum” in which visitors can visit all year long. Especially during the Children’s day, PlanToys organizes many activities for children in the community to join.” (Marketing Officer)

In terms of social responsibility value, Thai traditions and culture are regarded as critical in lifting employees’ morale. Plan Creation has conducted traditional and religious ceremonies regularly for this purpose. In addition, local traditional and cultural activities are supported by the company, such as merit-making ceremonies or cremation services. Employees are also allowed to schedule their work so that they can leave to attend such ceremonies. Such a practice obviously leads to improving social and cultural outputs.

“Another activity is a meditation program that we open for all employees to join.” (HR Officer)

# 5.2. Measurable Outputs

Outputs from applying the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in an organization can be classified into four important groups: economic output, environmental output, and social and cultural outputs [3].

In terms of economic outputs, Plan Creation has demonstrated continuous growth in performance. The company has continued to provide sustainable returns for shareholders and stakeholders with an increasing rate from 2013 to 2017. According to the public data from the Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce, Thailand, Plan Creation was the leader with the highest market share in its industry between 2013 and 2017. The average total income over that period was 379.6 Million THB, which was better than those top three competitors in the same industry (158.8 million, 121.6 million, 83.4 million THB). The five-year average net profit of Plan Creation was also the highest in the industry, i.e., 5.3 million THB, compared with those top three competitors in the same industry (3.7 million, 0.78 million, −5.2 million). The company has also improved operational efficiency. For example, the company reduced its production cost by approximately 10 percent in 2017 by relocating its factory to a southern province of Thailand close to the source of raw materials (e.g., rubberwood).

In terms of environmental outputs, the company can bring about lower waste emissions. It can also reduce the ratio of real wood usage by 32%. Subsequently, the use of wood chips helps to reduce waste emission even further. Table 4 below compares the proportion and cost of raw materials of the company.

**Table 4. Comparison of raw materials by proportion and cost.**
|Raw Materials|Proportion of Real Wood|Cost (THB)/Kilogram|
|---|---|---|
|Plan wood|68%|13.75|
|Real wood|100%|20.13|

Moreover, carbon emission was also reduced significantly. The company has continuously collected data about the carbon emission rate since 2012. The carbon emission rate of the company was reduced from 2747.1 carbon ton in 2012 to 2140.5 carton ton in 2013. This is considered a more than 20% reduction rate. After real wood was replaced by Plan wood, the ratio of carbon was reduced by 53.75% as demonstrated in Table 5.

**Table 5. Raw materials and carbon emission of Planwood.**
|Raw Materials|Number of Tree Used Per Year|Carbon Emission Per Year (Carbon kilogram)|
|---|---|---|
|Plan wood|1746|68,110|
|Real wood|808|31,500|

# 5.3. Envisaged Outcomes

Plan Creation relies on its own process of the supply chain. Starting with raw materials, the company uses local rubberwood from rubberwood trees in the southern part, which can no longer produce latex. It does not rely on imported materials or energy from overseas countries. The company emphasizes and also utilizes its core competency, which is product design. With its unique designs, Plan Creation has developed a strong brand identity for its own. Lastly, the company also has devised its own manufacturing processes. With unique designs, manufacturing processes and brand identity, it is difficult for competitors to imitate.

Plan Creation has demonstrated its organizational immunity. The company can survive the global financial crisis in 2007 by maintaining a gross profit at 6%, during which time its competitors were not profitable. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pan Creation is not affected while other businesses in Thailand have been on the decline.

“We are not affected by the pandemic. As a matter of facts, our sales volume increases because we invested in building overseas factories and online channels.” (Managing Director)

Lastly, the company has demonstrated its organizational resilience via several crises. Notably, it could bound back from the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis within 3–4 years, while other companies could not survive.

In summary, our findings demonstrate a close fit between Plan Creation’s business practices and the Sufficiency Thinking model. We can conclude that the knowledge and virtuous values are the foundation of the Sufficiency Thinking mindset at Plan Creation. This shared mindset is characterized by moderation, reasonableness and prudence. It is this mindset that drives corporate practices that are consistent with sustainable leadership practices. Finally, there is evidence of the expected outputs of economic, environmental, cultural and social outputs and outcomes of self-reliance, resilience and immunity at Plan Creation. Contributing to the literature, the present study helps us to enhance our understanding of the corporate sustainability process.

# 6. Managerial Implications for SMEs

Our study offers some important implications for practicing managers particularly the SME owners who wish to sustain their business by adopting the Sufficiency Economy philosophy. SME business leaders should identify perseverance as a required value for new employees. The recruiting process should assess a candidate whether she/he has persisted in going through difficulties. Perseverance should also be a criterion in employee performance evaluation. Perseverant employees should be publicly recognized so that other employees understand management’s expected behavior.

In addition, SME owners should start by giving priority to product, service and process innovations. Starting with continuous marketing analysis, co-creation with users, suppliers, and relevant parties should be conducted to design products or to prove processes. Local wisdom or culture shall be integrated into the new product development process or operational improvement process.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

Core competency shall be identified and maintained within its own companies rather than outsourcing them from others. Moreover, SME leaders should maintain a good, long-term relationship with stakeholders including suppliers, as they can be partners to develop innovative products and processes.

SME leaders should take into consideration the Sufficiency Economy philosophy by balancing between a short-term and long-term view. Risk management shall be considered along with prudent decision making to make an investment or expansion. Top management should focus on long-term sustainable growth, although in doing so, it may have to sacrifice short-term profits. A policy to give priority to utilize internal capital for expansion should be carefully reviewed and formulated.

Adopting a stakeholder focus approach, SME leaders should start by acting as a role model for employees. They should also be responsible for a broad range of stakeholders. They should also sponsor and participate in cultural and local activities in the nearby communities, and allow employees to join even during an office hour.

Finally, SME leaders should be willing to share their knowledge with a wide range of stakeholders, including competitors, to help to educate customers and suppliers along the value chain. Ultimately, the sharing practice helps to advance the relevant market, industry and society.

# 7. Future Research

Typical to a case study approach, the findings here are limited by a single case company. They should be further examined quantitatively via a larger sample size from a variety of different industrial and organizational settings. Moreover, future research may consider refining the Sufficiency Thinking model by adopting a robust theory building approach such as the Integrated Theory Building Methodology [12] to develop a theory of sustainable SME management.

# 8. Conclusions

Findings at Plan Creation endorse the Sufficiency Thinking model as an approach to ensure corporate sustainability. At the same time, it also endorses the Sufficiency Economy philosophy as a viable approach to corporate sustainability. The present study also demonstrates how the virtues, knowledge and Sufficiency Mindset have infused throughout the business activities at Plan Creation. The findings also indicate that adopting the Sufficiency Economy philosophy leads to cultural, social, environmental and economic outputs. Future research directions, including the development of a theory of sustainable SME management, were discussed. Finally, recommendations for practicing managers were pointed out.

# Abstract

Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation causes failures of the sustainability policy. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of the present study is to explore the factors that create hurdles in the implementation of corporate sustainability policy in letters and spirits. The study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) approach and reviews all the possible studies from 1950 to 2019 published by six major publishing houses. These studies were found using selected keywords. The findings of SLR reveal governance, education, and SMEs as frequently appearing words while exploring corporate sustainability. The stakeholder theory and the institutional theory appear as the most cited theories in the sustainability literature. The grassroots approach, environmental impact assessment, integrated sustainability assessment, evidence-based practice approach, systematic approach, economical instrument policy approach, and consultant services approach appear as the most relevant approaches used for policymaking in corporate sustainability. The SLR findings reveal five significant factors that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation and can cause the gap between policy and its implementation. These factors are government institutions (including macro and meso-institutions), internal and external stakeholders, management, organizational barriers, and normative references.

# Introduction

Corporate sustainability (CS) has become a part of the business community’s vernacular worldwide. The origin of the CS concept is mainly linked to the Brundtland report (1987), which incorporates CS through the triple bottom line of long-term economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility into a company’s management and operations (Bansal 2005). Despite the effective policymaking on CS, its implementation is frequently questioned. Since the policymaking and implementation are two different realms (Galbreath 2009), both aspects need to be equally reinforced for productive results. Kotler (2001) mentioned that the policy’s implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organization’s objectives. Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation is one of the core reasons for sustainability policy’s failure. Further, since the policies are written documents, these cannot be implemented in the real organizational setting without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication down the line to the implementation team (Ménard et al. 2018).

Organizational policies for long-term growth give an apex position to sustainability (Perrini and Minoja 2008). The reason for the importance of CS in decision-making can be traced back to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, S. W. S 1987). The report titled “Our

Common Future considers sustainability as the key driver for the prosperous global future for present and future generations. The report strongly suggests the corporate sector to focus on sustainable policies to meet the need of the present generation without harming future generations’ ability to meet their own needs.

The challenges to corporate sustainability are continual and require exploring new sustainable approaches (Alexander 2020) to overcome them (Raja et al. 2019). Especially at the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) level, it is crucial to see as to why the execution of policy remains a dilemma. Whether these are internal capabilities of a firm like dependability, flexibility, and future technology improvement (Caldera et al. 2019) or the external factors like governmental laws and regulations that affect an SMEs’ sustainability (Kumar and Saravanan 2017; Yang and Ha-Brookshire 2019). It requires a comprehensive review of the sustainability research to explore factors that play an intermittent role between formulated policies and their implementation. This way may provide plausible solutions to tackle the intermittent factors which cause damages to sustainability policy (Fischer et al. 2020; Jang 2020).

Sustainability encompasses three dimensions. First, organizations need to become socially responsible, the second organization needs to be environmentally friendly, and third, the organizations should create wealth for the shareholder. In this context, CS practices can simultaneously create benefits for society and profit maximization for shareholders in an environmentally driven business situation (Al Am 2016; Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013). Furthermore, CS practices also better all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, contractors, community members, positive impact on the environment, and shareholder value maximization (Miska et al. 2018). Hence these practices improve reputation, reliability, and good relationship with stakeholders (Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013; Moktadir et al. 2018).

There are a thousand of initiatives practiced by private organizations for societal and environmental improvement. International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) (n.d.-a, b), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are among those who provide generic guidelines and are recognized by the governments and implementing in their countries according to their need and priority (Klettner et al. 2014). Despite having extensive policy frameworks to ensure sustainable corporate practices, their implementation is grossly missing. According to crude estimates, a few percent of the businesses truly execute the CS policies. Many organizations do greenwashing by showing some charity and environmental driven steps (Ramus and Montiel 2005). It raises a serious question of whether the CS policies are overambitious or the organizations are reluctant to implement them (Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2010).

Janaina et al. (2020) argued that decision-makers must understand local management practices and concepts instead of imposing challenging requirements on local companies and society. The growing demand for eco-friendly products invites the textile companies to search for diverse environmental instruments to fulfill the demand of customers who look for a sustainable product. In this way, companies can sustainably gain a premium price to enhance profit in a promising way (Hayat et al. 2020).

There may be some other factors due to which the CS policies may not be translated into actions. The present study undertakes this task by comprehensively reviewing the literature on CS policies to draw the reasons for the literature’s lack of implementation. This study contributes to the much-needed debate of the gap between CS policies and their implementation. The study also contributes by providing the steps that can be instrumental in implementing CS policies. The subsequent section of the paper briefly entails the methodology adopted for the review.

# Material and method

The early research on sustainability started in the year 1950s (such as Bowen 1953). Therefore, we selected the studies published between the 1950 to 2020 period for this comprehensive review. We developed ten keywords to search the articles related to CS (see Table 1). The various combinations of these keywords were used to query the research articles from selected six databases (see Table 1). In the first search, 1224 papers were downloaded using the keywords or their combinations. After reading the titles, 845 research papers were retained as the rest of the papers were not directly linked with CS, CS policies and/or its implementation. In the second phase, abstracts of all 845 papers read and 107 articles were retained for the final review. The yearly detail of the article.

Governance appeared as a significant study area in all six publishers; education and SMEs appeared as the second most essential study areas, followed by innovation, urban studies, EU policies, research, and innovation financial and fiscal studies.

Before proceeding further, it is imperative to discuss the different terminologies, which addresses CS’s concept. Researchers use interchangeable terminologies, such as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate philanthropy, corporate social performance, socially responsible behavior, corporate ethics, stakeholders management, corporate accountability to reflect the sustainability of a firm (Ahmed and Ahmed 2011; Barron 2010; Helleno et al. 2017; Miska et al. 2018; Pedersen 2006; Sheinbaum-Pardo et al. 2012). The stated terminologies represent the tri-dimensional concept of CS, including social, environmental, and economic dimensions. We use term CS in this paper to reflect the sustainability of a firm.

Inclusion criteria for this review studies are the social and environmental dimensions of CS carried out on policy and practice issues in SMEs, manufacturing, and services sectors.

We have divided the literature review section into five sub-sections. The “Introduction” section gives a brief profile of CS concept, the “Material and method” section addresses theoretical exposition, the “Literature review” section CS policy and practices, the “Results and discussion” section addresses different policy approaches, and finally, the “Concluding remarks” section addresses the factors affecting CS policy and practices.

# Literature review

# Profile of corporate sustainability

Over the last few decades, different researchers investigated the domain of social obligations of businesspersons. During the evolution of CS, Andrew Carnegie (1889), a businessperson/philanthropist, wrote an essay on the concept of social obligation, wherein he emphasized the wealthy class of society needs the philanthropic/well-being of the poor (laborers) who are trying to bring social change in their lives. People in business need to understand the difference between social responsibility and charity (Clark 1916); he further added that the problem is not helping society’s deprived class. However, it is the approach and perspective of businessmen who help the under privileged class with charity rather than business responsibility. Berle (1932), in his scholastic note, calls for the attention of the trust factor between business and societal well-being. Abrams (1951), Clark (1926), and Kreps (1940) also discussed the social obligation of businesspersons.

In subsequent decades, scholars further extended the research work of the social responsibility of business organizations. Howard Bowen is considered the father of CSR in the western world (Carroll 1999; Türkel and Akan 2015). In 1953, Howard Bowen argued for business organizations’ social obligation and explained that CS practices brought a competitive advantage for the organization.

Since the early years, the concept of CS remained a complex—known as social responsibility in the 1950s and 1960s. Davis (1960) explained that business leaders could deal with the social responsibility of the businesses in the next fifty years.

# Policy and practice of corporate sustainability

The popularity of CS influenced the policy and planning approaches (McLean and Borén 2015). Perrini and Minoja (2008) emphasized that corporate behavior towards sustainability has gained a central position among sustainability-conscious decision-makers. Policy formulation and implementation are two different domains (Galbreath 2009), and according to Kotler (2001), policy implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organizational objectives. Therefore, despite focusing on sustainability policy and planning, failures in the implementation phase occur up to some extent; one reason for the failure of sustainability policy is the gap between policy and its implementation. In view, Ménard et al. (2018) argued that policies are written documents, and, without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication cannot be implemented in the contexts.

It is rare in literature how to make a policy coherent with all three dimensions of CS (Klettner et al. 2014); thus, when management device policies and when it implements, most of the time it lacks (Spiller and Savedoff 1999). One core gap, which causes flaws, is the lack of leadership commitment and the clarification/understanding of policy. Ménard et al. (2018) argued that meso-institutions are responsible for the implementation and operationalization of policies; if not adequately addressed the policy, then they mislead and end up with gaps between policy and practice.

There are several contributing factors to the success or failure of policies. Roosa (2007) argued that sustainability policy’s objectives and goals could not be achieved without the contribution and successful nexus of stakeholders (citizens) and the policymaking authorities.

Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet (2010) argued that gaps between policies and practices occur particularly in developing countries due to unrealistic thinking, overambitious policies, objectives that are distant from reality, local culture, norms and values of society. Unrealistic policies end-up with gaps when these policies come to the level of implementation. Ménard et al. (2018) also argued that some part of the gap arises due to poor performance of meso-institutions.

Bonn and Fisher (2011) explained that CS is the missing part of the policy, and it must be incorporated in the organizations’ strategic decisions. Corporate policy and CS policy of the organization in the form of a single organizational strategy can address problems of environmental and social dimensions along with profit maximization (Engert et al. 2016). Baumgartner (2014) said that making a CS policy is not the only important factor, but how to implement the same is even more essential.

Despite the popularity of CS and its priority in the western world, one single generic policy encompassing CS and organizational strategy may not be equally adaptable for all.

organizations due to the specific needs and demands of differ-

ent stakeholders. Hence, the companies’ management has to

put their efforts and look into their particular needs while

formulating the policies (Bos Brouwers 2010; Gouldson and

Sullivan 2007; Springett 2003). One more area which needs

attention is that when policymakers need to choose one among

environment and economic dimension; policymakers always

supersede the economic dimension over the environmental

dimension. Paulraj (2009) argued that commitment to the pol-

icy and implementation of the policy are two different and

independent factors, and companies opt the minimum of legal

compliances and try to resolve the environmental issues.

However, from the perspective of developing countries, it

varies from country to country according to their needs and

demands (Abreu 2009).

With the passage of time, most companies have started

adopting the CS, instead of avoiding it as the management

of the companies has realized that by adopting CS, efficiency

and productivity of the company may be increased (Jnr et al.

2019). However, to become a responsible organization in the

business community, it requires planning in the realm of

policymaking and implementation, which may not only take

the organization beyond the profitmaking and legal compli-

ance but also provides the opportunity to work for the mitiga-

tion of risk aversion and bridging gaps between business and

society (Morgan et al. 2009). Furthermore, CS addresses the

issues of well-being and environmental degradation. It also

guides management to resolve the core problems related to

their products (Werther and Chandler 2010).

# Corporate sustainability policy approaches

There are several underlying approaches to develop a policy

for CS. Researchers contributed different ideas in this realm;

all have their rationale and significance. Scholars have

discussed different approaches (Klettner et al. 2014).

Pedersen (2006) stressed that in social responsibility, the par-

ticipatory approach has five elements to understand the dia-

logue between social responsibility and stakeholders; it

includes inclusion, openness, tolerance, empowerment, and

transparency.

Davies (2009) suggested the idea of a Grassroots approach

through environmental education on grassroots and

community-based interventions. The Environmental Impact

Assessment Approach is another avenue for policy planning,

which integrates policy appraisal and supports sustainable de-

velopment more than the sectoral appraisal system. This ap-

proach provides rational and quality information for decision-

making. Integrated Sustainability Assessment approach for

sustainable development policymaking is participatory and

based on a participatory cyclic process of scoping,

envisioning, experimenting, and learning through the shared

interpretation of sustainability; it helps to develop and apply in

an integrated manner in the context (Whitmarsh et al. 2009).

Evidence-based policymaking is another approach, but as

the perspective of business sectors and its context complicates

the application of this approach (Jasanoff 2009; Radaelli

1995; Nutley et al. 2007). The practice approach is another

idea for the CS policy and strategy; it recommends that the

attention of companies is to be on the practice (Guohui and

Eppler 2008). A systematic approach is also an integral ap-

proach; its impact is widespread in all sectors, especially in the

construction industry (Davies 2009). The systematic approach

is the holistic idea in such a sector because today’s decision

must have room for alteration for future generations (Hendriks

2004). Fischer (2000) argued that the systematic approach

advocates for participatory decision-making instead of solo

decisions. This approach suggests taking the input of stake-

holders for better decisions; by doing so, stakeholder’s per-

spective adds insight wisdom to the process from the end-user

point of view; by this approach, policy and planning can

become comprehensive.

The economic instrument policy approach is also

supporting in controlling environmental pollution. Bailey

(1999) and Kennedy (1996) argued that business organization

internalizes the cost of pollution that they create in this ap-

proach. Clarke and Roome (1999) emphasize the role of in-

termediaries in the adaption of environmental practices. In

order to know the feasible option for SMEs, the

intermediaries/consultants can provide access to readily avail-

able expert knowledge to SMEs and can contribute and in-

crease their absorptive capacity.

Achieving, sustainability goal in all sectors of human

endeavor; requires a quality decision process for policy

management, which includes significant ongoing informa-

tion gathering, processing, and disseminating efforts

(Clark 2009). There are five different types of sustainabil-

ity impacts identified on governance modes: (i) centralized

governance, (ii) decentralized governance, (iii) public-

private partnership, (iv) interactive governance, (v) self-

regulation (Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).

They explained the earlier two are traditional command-

and-control approaches of policy. Driessen et al. (2012)

further explained that, in the centralized-mode of policy,

the central government’s role is crucial, and the

decentralized-mode of policy is cantonal. They further ex-

plained in the public-private partnership mode of policy

that the role of the public sector organization is to interact

with privates’ associations for policymaking. The fourth

mode of governance is the collaborative governance

among the public sector, private sector, and civil society

on an equal basis. The final mode of governance is self-

regulation. Deakin and Hobbs (2007) argue that self-

regulation model is an opportunity for a business organi-

zation to embed in society.

# Factors affecting corporate sustainability policy and practices

In the literature review, multiple factors were identified which affected policymaking and implementation of technological change and influence societal practices (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018). Fairbrass (2011) mentioned that government/public authorities need policy debate with interested parties comprised of different stakeholders in policymaking.

# Role of government/public sector institutions

Keeping in view the critique of Friedman (1962), the social dimension is not the responsibility of the business organization; however, governments through legislation may control the business organizations to comply with a social dimension. The report of Brundtland et al. (1987) also identified that government should control the careless use of natural resources, which creates an adverse effect on the environment. In this context, the role of the governments is essential for the implementation and monitoring of CS. In recent years to become competitive in the international market, the Chinese regulatory authorities have forced Chinese companies to adopt CS (Zhu 2016).

Among the emerging economies the manufacturing sector is highly energy intensive sector. Thus, it is essential to look into the CS issues (Yu et al. 2017). The industrial growth in China has produced a huge volume of Carbon Dioxide and is considered the most resource-consuming and polluting country. China can bring immense improvement in global environmental issues (Feng et al. 2018).

Busch and Hoffmann (2009) and Luan et al. (2013) emphasized that government plays an instrumental role in putting the firms on track for eco-friendly attitude. Ecoprofit, an Austrian-based initiative, helps SMEs in reducing the environmental impact of SMEs. The company has implemented number of energy conservation projects with the help of local government (Beise and Rennings 2005; Rennings et al. 2006; van Hemel and Cramer 2002). Likewise, in Manali, an Indian tourism destination, stakeholders’ efforts failed to achieve their environmental objectives due to the local government’s lack of interest. Gardner and Sinclair (2003) explained that the role of the state was crucial in eradicating the pollution problems. In another example of government intervention to improve the environmental conditions, Xanthos and Walker (2017) described that pollution problems had compelled the governments to devise laws/policies to overcome the pollution problems.

The role of local government was also crucial in the implementation of policies (Sinclair and Fenton 1997) comparing the Canadian National Packaging Protocol and the European Parliament Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. They identified that the EU and Canada policies were weak as there was a lack of obligation at the province level in Canada and member states level in the EU. Another view of policymaking is environmental taxation, which can bring desirable change in the right direction. This approach can contribute in long terms.

# Organizational barriers

For better implementation of CS policies, researchers identified multiple factors. A study of CS in the Chinese manufacturing industry (Orji 2019) identified twelve barriers, wherein eleven are organizational barriers. These barriers include inefficient, poor, and inadequate plans, poor waste management, low suppliers selection, lack of finances, inferior technology, lack of top management commitment, communication gap, lack of training, lack of awareness among stakeholders, insufficient environmental compliances, and absence of good employee welfare plans. Several other researchers also identified these organizational barriers in their studies (Klewitz et al. 2012; Nykvist and Nilsson 2009; Moore 2005; Orji 2019; Trianni et al. 2017).

Engert et al. (2016) argue that companies must take the initiative to incorporate CS in their policies. Managers must create a learning environment or learning organization where employees interact with CS’s environmental and social dimensions. Nykvist and Nilsson (2009) mentioned that an organizational barrier includes lack of adequate time, expertise, resources, and availability of sufficient data for decision-making; and some structural barriers, which include the behavior of the policymaker, and the business sector is also one factor that affects the policy implementation process. Policy management has two essential factors, first is policy formulation, and the second is its implementation (Mintzberg and Waters 1985). Companies have developed sufficient skills in devising the policies; whereas the implementation of the policy still lacks (Zahn 1979), which causes the gap between the policy and its implementation.

# Self-regulation/subsidiarity/reflexive laws

The subsidiarity approach in environmental issues advocates for addressing and resolving the environmental problems at the local level within the member states of the EU, preferably with the participation of local authorities and citizens (Collier 1997). CS practice is an opportunity for business organizations, through which businesses can embed themselves in society by addressing social needs. This opportunity is not stringent, and it is based on reflexive law/self-regulation (Deakin and Hobbs 2007). In reality, CS practices are still not adopted in business processes. Once, If the CS issues are understood, businesses can avert risk and meet competitiveness (Deakin and Hobbs 2007; Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).

# Role of stakeholders

Stakeholders are the most influential actors in policy planning and implementation (Masurel 2007). Mathis (2007) examined the CS policy implementation in the dairy sector of the Netherland. He drew three inferences from the result of the study. First, he identified that a higher level of stakeholder management with the help of CS engagement allows business organizations to create a closer link with public authorities. Second, he identified that stakeholders influence the policymaking process. Third, the proactive approach towards CS policy in the private sector leads to self-regulation.

# Normative references

Kehbila et al. (2010) examined the state of environmental policy implementation in the South African Automotive Industry. Their study revealed that the South African Government was concerned for the country’s environmental condition, due to loss of biodiversity, land, disposal of waste, deterioration of air quality, noise pollution, and degradation of the marine environment. Kehbila et al. (2010) reported that large and SME sizes of automobile companies are operating in South Africa, and all are committed to maintaining the sustainability matters of automobile sectors. Results revealed that companies have ISO 14001 certification, ISO 9001 quality audit (external and internal), which includes SMEs. Dankova et al. (2015) explained three levels and types of standards being initiated/practices internationally, i.e., (i) sustainability standard based on political wills, such as UNGS, OECD ME, OECD CG, and GSC, (ii) CS standard based on professional judgment, such as SA8000 and ISO 26000, and (iii) CS reporting standards, such as GRI and EFFAS KPIs.

policymaking process. The more engage the stakeholders, and the more will influence the dialogue creates influences sustainability. Internal and external stakeholder pressure shape the policymaking process. In this study, organizational barriers identified include rigid disciplinary (lack of room for initiative), lack of evaluation systems, and the participation of public sector institutions in organization follow its CS policy published on its websites. It identified that the services cost of the pollution they produce, and it is an essential support for successful CS policy. The focus remained on minimizing policy where the organizations internalize the effective implementation of CS policy.

Third, a proactive approach to the CSR policy in the private sector is less likely to implement the environmental policies. This study emphasized the role of SME can obtain their services and can help in CS knowledge. The identified factors affecting the policy include unclear priorities.

# Results and discussion

The study intended to explore the relevant literature for understanding the corporate sustainability policymaking and implementation, different policy approaches, and the most important to identify the factors which affect the outcome of the CS policy and its implementation (see Table 6).

Through the literature review, it is learned that the pressing demand for corporate sustainability invites the academicians, researchers, and practitioners to practice the sustainability dimensions for a prosperous future and sustainable development. Thus, it is emphasized that practitioners should devise the CS policy and corporate policy as a single/combined policy.

After a thorough review of relevant articles, a total of five significant factors were identified which could influence the policymaking process (see Table 5). In these five factors, most of the scholars debated on the role of government/public sector institutions and stakeholders. Apart from these two, the organizational barriers have also appeared from the articles’ review as a significant factor (see Table 7). The elements in the organizational barrier need a focus to address the CS issues for better results.

Based on the literature reviewed, barriers and enablers are identified, which has further two types each, following is the detail of barriers and enablers.

Self-regulations/subsidiarity and normative references are also important factors identified. The importance of normative references cannot be overlooked for the organizations’ better quality products and services.

The facts which have come to the foreground after a thorough review show that at a different level of the public sector (macro and meso-institution), different stakeholder and different business models need to adopt an adequate policymaking approach among identified different policy approaches (see Table 4) for their success to achieve sustainable development for the better future of organizations.

# Evaluative study

# Concluding remarks

Fahey and Pralle (2016) argued that environmental policy research lacks in underdeveloped countries, and they call for more research in less wealthy countries around the world. Armstrong and Kamieniecki (2019) shed light on the importance of common sustainability challenges such as climate change. They emphasized the public sector pursuing sustainability problems in isolation and need to collaborate with the stakeholders for shared understanding and better policymaking.

With the overview of the literature, it is learned that policymakers of the organizations also need to strategize the

essential part of policy formulation. Once the stated factors and elements discussed above are considered in the entire process of policymaking, it will adequately address policy and practice gaps. Furthermore, it is also learned that, in many cases, states and governments’ intervention becomes imperative to make the policies successful and achieve desired results.

In the context of policymaking, it is identified that SMEs by their structure has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include informal ways of communications, less bureaucratic environment, speedy decision-making, direct interaction with customers and clients, and lean organizational structure. Simultaneously, disadvantages include lack of finances, lack of knowledge, and lack of expert human resource for sustainability issues. The disadvantages are like barriers and posing challenges for integrating the SME’s business activities with sustainability (Klewitz et al. 2012).

It is evident in the literature that the organization implements the environmental policy because of the reasons such as government laws and regulation, stakeholder’s pressure, competitor’s pressure, economic advantages (Bansal and Roth 2000; Mubarik 2015; Khan et al. 2020; Mubarik and Naghavi 2020; Alam et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2019). Another view to bridge the gaps between the policy and implementation needs a thorough translation of the policy into action plans, such as setting the objective, preparing the guidelines, and action plans (Epstein and Roy 2007) (see Figs. 2 and 3).

# Limitation

Since the CS is a broad concept, so as its policy and practice too. Thus, it is a challenging task to explore the entire body of knowledge. Hence, this review paper is limited to six (see Table 2) leading publishers with 10 keywords; more specifically, only CS policy and practice related significant paper were chosen for review.

# Implications

# Theoretical implication

In this review paper, stakeholder theory appeared as the most cited theory and institutional theory is the second most cited theory. It has come the foreground that institutional theory is embedded in the stakeholder theory or we can say that stakeholder theory encapsulate the isomorphic and defusion elements of institutional theory. This encapsulation will implicate the future research to expand and explore the further depth of stakeholder theory.

In this review paper specific factors and subfactors explored (see Fig. 3 and Table 7) which has impact on CS policy practices. These factors and subfactors will serve as base work for future quantitative research studies.

Furthermore, schematic snapshot developed on the basis of this review paper (see Fig. 2) depicts that how the global sustainability initiative creates trickle down impact from United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and penetrates in signatory countries macro and meso level policymaking institutions and subsequently encourages the companies operating in respective countries for practices of social and environmental dimensions. When the firms start practicing social and environmental initiatives, then the role of different management theories emerges according to the pressure of different stakeholders operating in the internal and external environment the companies.

The triple bottom line framework is operating in the management system, yet the volume of practices of social and environmental dimensions on the company basis, and in return its impact on society and environment is still vague. Researchers need to further investigate to devise methods so that utilization of financial capital and HR capital for CS practices may be quantitatively compared with the policy outcome of a company.

Keeping in view the essence of co-evolutionary theory, in this review paper, it has emerged that lack of knowledge of CS and policy making among stakeholders is hindering in obtaining the maximum advantage of limited resources and strengths of stakeholders. This essential implication of this review paper invites the policymakers to address it.

# Practical implication

This review paper will contribute as an authentic snapshot for future practitioners from two perspectives. First perspective is the eight different policy approaches being adopted by the policy makers (see Table 4). Each policy approach has its own significance and varies from sector to sector and business to business, and practitioners can formulate their organizational policy in the light of stated approaches. Second perspective is the factors affecting CS policy and practices (see Tables 5 and 6); the implications of these factors can contribute as a guidance tool in the process of policy making to avoid intermittent which causes the gaps in CS policy and practice.

# Recommendations

For future research, it is recommended to investigate the magnitude of factors and subfactors of CS Practices (see Fig. 3). It is also recommended to investigate the magnitude and direction of factors in Table 7 on CS practices. Furthermore, it is recommended to understand the effectivity of co-evolutionary theory in collaboration with the stakeholder theory.

# Abstract

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offers important opportunities for the hospitality and tourism (HT) industry in the context of operations, design, marketing, destination management, human resources, revenue management, accounting and finance, strategic management, and beyond. However, the implementation of GAI in HT contexts comes with ethical, legal, social, and economic considerations that require careful reflection by HT firms. The purpose of this study is to offer a critical examination of the effects of GAI applications across a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the HT industry, in an effort to integrate practical and academic insights and foresights and drive academic research forward. Through the contributions of a purposeful selection of scholars, educators, and industry practitioners, along the tenets of the stakeholder theory of the firm, this study highlights the potential challenges and opportunities of GAI and considers how academics can navigate the (research) complexities of this rapidly evolving technological phenomenon.

# Impact Statement

This study critically reviews and discusses the role of GAI and postulates expert opinion on the implications of GAI for hospitality and tourism stakeholders. In so doing, this study provides a comprehensive discussion on this disruptive subject that inspires, provokes, excites, and engages hospitality and tourism scholars, researchers, educators, industry practitioners, and other stakeholders. This study further proposes an integrative conceptual framework of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms affects a wide range of HT stakeholders that may result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value through resource-based, ethical, financial, legal, educational, cultural, and technological mechanisms. By integrating the perspectives of more than 30 hospitality and tourism academics and practitioners on the conceptualization of this subject, the current study offers insight and foresight and may serve as a catalyst for further impactful research.

# Introduction

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a form of artificial intelligence that can create various forms of original content. In contrast to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which can independently learn and execute a wide range of tasks and ideas (and is presently only hypothetical), GAI is referred to as “generative” because it can generate specific kinds of output, such as text, audio, images, and video, based on supervised or unsupervised training (Stening, 2023). Popular GAI tools include platforms such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Bard, DALL-E 2, and many others.

The potential impact of this technology on society and humanity is profound; and like all industries, the hospitality and tourism (HT) industry is poised for a wide range of exciting new advancements and unprecedented challenges as GAI continues to develop (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023a, 2023b; Mich & Garigliano, 2023). For example, when applied to marketing functions in the HT industry, GAI can use travel history, consumption preferences, and social media content to create personalized recommendations for travelers, generate descriptions of destinations and hotel properties, and even create virtual tours of hotels and attractions (Lalli, 2023), simultaneously creating value for firms and consumers. Likewise, on the financial side, GAI-enabled technologies can generate novel insights into portfolio optimization strategies, capital structure, key performance indicators, and fund allocations (Kizildag et al., 2019; Ozdemir et al., 2023), simultaneously creating value for firms and for society. Indeed, for nearly all functional areas of HT firms, there are potential applications of GAI that can be used to increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, enhance workplace productivity, and enrich the customer experience.

Despite the excitement over the potential benefits of GAI, however, the adoption of such technologies comes with a set of ethical, social, and economic considerations. In many cases, the use of GAI is seen as a double-edged sword, where the solution to old problems can become the source of new ones (Zhuo et al., 2023). Many such problems have already arrived in the form of privacy and security concerns, intellectual property rights violations, and liability and accountability issues, to name only a few. In acknowledgment of both the promises and the challenges of GAI, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we seek to provide a critical examination of the effects of GAI applications across a broad spectrum of industrial and social stakeholders in HT. Second, we propose an integrative conceptual framework of GAI adoption in the HT industry that can be used in pursuit of meaningful future research in the field. Through the contribution of a wide range of academic and practical perspectives, this paper highlights the potential advantages and disadvantages of GAI and considers how GAI researchers can navigate the complexities of this rapidly evolving technology.

In taking such an approach, this paper develops a conceptual framework for the future exploration of GAI in hospitality and tourism research. As such, the purpose of this research is not to present a detailed account of the current state of GAI in the HT industry. Rather, the goal is to propose a framework that can be used to ensure that future GAI-based research is maximally relevant to practical hospitality and tourism management. In so doing, the study addresses Mondal and colleagues’ (2023) call for comprehensive models and frameworks to analyze the application of GAI in different sectors. Specifically, this paper takes a stakeholder theory perspective of the GAI phenomenon, providing an account of the potential benefits and challenges of GAI for HT firms in relation to customers, employees, suppliers, and many other stakeholders in the HT landscape. The end result is a list of 50 research questions that can be used to drive forward the exciting new era of GAI-based research in the HT industry.

# Methodology

Given that the goal of this research is the creation of a framework to drive the future of an emerging research phenomenon (i.e., GAI in the HT industry), an inductive methodological approach was taken. Specifically, 30 hospitality and tourism practitioners with a wide range of research and industrial expertise were selected to participate in this research. Rather than enlisting these experts as data points, all contributors were asked to take authorship of the paper. In accordance with the tenets of theoretical sampling, the contributors to (and thus, authors of) this research were carefully chosen to represent a broad range of hospitality and tourism expertise, including law, finance, marketing, operations, finance, accounting, strategic management, human resources, design, sustainability, restaurants, hotels, destinations, and travel.

# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism

designed to be collectively exhaustive or mutually exclusive, analysis of the content provided across the contributing authors indicated that most of the major functional areas of HT industries were represented.

The 30 hospitality and tourism experts were identified through the process of theoretical sampling and then contacted via e-mail to solicit their participation in the project. All 30 people who were contacted agreed to contribute. In order to ensure a common frame of reference across contributors, the e-mail contained a set of instructions for how to contribute. Specifically, each contributor was asked to write up to 500 words on the implications of GAI in the field of hospitality and tourism management. As per JHTR’s guidelines, contributors were asked to focus on “big ideas” that “generate transcendent insight that inspires, provokes, excites, and engages our audiences.” Additionally, contributors were expressly asked to provide an account of the transformative effects of GAI on HT industry stakeholders, focusing on what is already happening as well as what could potentially happen in the future. After providing this discussion, contributors were asked to provide an additional 100 to 200 words that would indicate the most imperative research questions pertaining to their writings.

Each contributor was given 2 weeks to make their submission, with a reminder e-mail sent at the 1-week mark. The reminder e-mail reiterated the instructions regarding big ideas, stakeholder emphasis, and so forth. Once all writings were received, the analysis was conducted in two parts: (1) model development and writing integration and (2) development of research questions and ranking.

To develop the model, four of the authors acted as an editorial team to review, sort, aggregate, and interpret the submissions of the other authors. Through the process of thematic analysis and emergent design, an integrative framework (referred to as the REFLECT model) was developed. The primary themes inherent to the model included the functional areas of HT firms/industry domains in which GAI is adopted/implemented; the stakeholders in the HT landscape affected by GAI adoption; and the mechanisms through which these effects are calibrated (i.e., REFLECT factors). Consistent with the value creation perspective of stakeholder theory, the final emergent theme was the dual processes of co-creation and co-destruction of value that are manifested in a reciprocal nature via the other three components of the model. The writings of all the authors were then organized around the four emergent themes. Specifically, the editorial team collaborated via video conferencing to organize and edit all the written submissions of the other authors. In this way, this research and the end results (i.e., the sections of the manuscript that follow) is not a set of standalone contributions; rather, this manuscript represents the integration of a large and diverse group of experts, presented in a unified model and driven by an inductively-derived theoretical framework.

Finally, the research directives and/or questions submitted by each author were reviewed. As before, the four editorial authors worked together to combine these contributions into a list of 50 specific questions across four different categories: general directives, GAI application questions, REFLECT-based questions, and stakeholder-based questions. A survey was then designed to allow each contributing author to rate each question on a 5-point importance scale ranging from “not at all important” to “extremely important.” This survey was then sent to all authors to complete. The results of this survey are presented in tabular form in the concluding section of the manuscript and highlight key areas of future inquiry into the GAI phenomenon.

# Emergent Framework of GAI in the HT Industry: The REFLECT Model

The themes and processes emerging from the methodological approach outlined above are proposed in a framework referred to hereafter as the REFLECT model of value co-creation and value-co-destruction (see Figure 1). This model provides an account of how the application of GAI across the different functional areas of HT firms (e.g., operations, management, marketing, etc.) can affect a wide range of social and industrial stakeholders. In the model, the HT firm is the principal agent of value creation in the hospitality ecosystem. The impact of firm-enabled GAI applications on various stakeholders is mediated by a variety of factors (the REFLECT mechanisms) that must be optimally calibrated to ensure that the firm maximizes the value created across the system, for as many stakeholders as possible.

While the HT firm has agency for creating and capturing value in a GAI-enabled hospitality ecosystem, the REFLECT model is predicated on two important considerations. First, in line with the service-dominant logic (SDL) of the firm, the value dynamics identified in the model are non-recursive in nature. GAI applications are fundamentally based on stakeholder interaction and engagement; thus, stakeholders are not passive recipients of a firm’s value proposition, but instead “co-create” (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004) and/or “co-destroy” (Ple & Caceres, 2010) value in the system. This latter possibility that GAI implementation can have adverse consequences leading to value co-destruction has been identified in extant research (e.g., Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Houde et al., 2020). For example, value is co-destroyed by a firm’s employees if they sabotage GAI applications that they perceive to be a threat to their jobs, because management did not enable an organizational culture conducive to GAI implementation and/or did not educate employees on the implications of GAI for their work.

Second, the value co-creation and co-destruction feedback loops indicate that the benefits of using GAI to facilitate mutually beneficial firm-stakeholder relationships (i.e., value co-creation) may, in turn, create friction in other stakeholder relationships (i.e., value co-destruction). For example, an improved customer experience due to GAI application may result in a loss of agency for employees, leading to lower job morale and engagement. Such friction can likely...

be mitigated by a consideration and calibration of the mediating REFLECT mechanisms, as will be explained in subsequent sections.

The model’s emphasis on value creation aligns with the principles of the stakeholder theory of the firm, which emphasizes the interconnected relationships between a business and its various stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, employees, investors, and communities. According to stakeholder theory, a company should create value for all stakeholders, rather than solely focusing on shareholders (Freeman et al., 2010). This theory combines the resource-based view and market-based view of the firm, while also considering sociopolitical factors (Phillips, 2003). It is important to note that stakeholder theory serves as a framework, providing a basis for various derived theories and models (Freeman et al., 2010), such as the one offered in the present study.

Considering the objective of our study, which aims to propose a framework ensuring that future research on GAI remains relevant to practical hospitality and tourism management, we developed the REFLECT model through an inductive analysis of authors’ writings. These writings, in turn, were based on prompts that prioritize the significance of stakeholders (Freeman et al., 2010). Furthermore, since GAI is a novel technology with potential applications in the hospitality industry, it presents both promising opportunities and ethical, legal, social, and economic challenges. Adopting a more inclusive and balanced approach that considers the needs and experiences of multiple stakeholders can facilitate ethical decision-making and foster mutually beneficial relationships, ultimately contributing to sustainable organizational success in GAI implementation.

The components and dynamics of the REFLECT model are thematically consistent with other frameworks that have been devised based on stakeholder theory (see Freudenreich et al., 2020; Mihailova et al., 2022), and, in this study, emphasize sustainable value creation via GAI application for HT firms. As follows, this manuscript integrates the perspectives of more than 30 hospitality and tourism academics and/or practitioners in terms of (1) GAI applications at the firm level and their potential for value co-creation and value co-destruction; (2) the REFLECT-based mechanisms through which such GAI applications can facilitate value co-creation and value co-destruction for industry stakeholders; and (3) the research questions that arise from the relationships in the REFLECT model.

# GAI Applications at the Firm Level

# Strategic Management

GAI has the ability to profoundly influence strategic management within the HT industry. In this context, strategic management is defined as “the process through which firms define their missions, visions, goals, and objectives, as well as craft and execute strategies at various levels of the firms’ hierarchies to create and sustain a competitive advantage” (Okumus et al., 2019, p. 5). Leadership plays a critical role in navigating the transition to a GAI-integrated strategic management model, and the role of leaders will evolve with the advent of this new technology. This shift may require new

# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism

# Leadership

Approaches to leadership that focus more on collaboration, agility, ethical and responsible use of GAI, and emotional intelligence to foster human–machine collaboration (Heukamp, 2020; Peifer et al., 2022).

One of the most important aspects of leadership is innovation, and GAI is particularly well-suited to assist leaders in creating value for the stakeholders. By assisting with the process of idea generation and brainstorming, GAI can assist leaders in identifying avenues through which the company can innovate new products and services that bring additional value to the company stakeholders, drawing upon knowledge and information far beyond that which would be accessible to individuals. This means that innovative idea generation will now no longer be dependent on a single visionary CEO or a small, highly experienced product development team, who are inherently limited in idea creation by the boundaries of their own knowledge or experience. This is not without downsides, however. Just as GAI can help a particular firm create value in this way, it can, at the same time, be providing the same information to other competing firms, resulting in an increased threat of substitutes, new entrants to the space, and a much more competitive environment. Over time, this can result in value co-destruction for the focal firm in the form of lost competitive advantages and increased spending on competitive warfare.

# Operations

There is no doubt that the advent of GAI is already impacting HT operations in a meaningful way and will continue to do so in ways we cannot yet imagine as the technology continues to develop. Because GAI can perform expressive tasks and craft individualized interactions with guests, it is ideal for communication purposes (Brendlinger, 2023). GAI chatbots, for example, can analyze customer data to understand the context of each customer inquiry and use natural language processing (NLP) techniques (Athuraliya & Farook, 2018) to craft a personalized response, resulting in the creation of value for the customer, who receives an instant, personalized answer to the question or request.

While such personalized recommendations and experiences create value for both the customer and the company, suggestions and experiences can also result in value co-destruction. Inherent in a personalized experience is the loss of the experimentation, exploration, and discovery that comes with trying new foods, traveling to offbeat places, and having experiences that force customers to stretch and grow outside of their comfort zone. Additionally, the information put forth by GAI can be incorrect, outdated, or biased, which can result in value co-destruction for both the firm and the customer in the form of bad experiences and guest complaints.

# Marketing

One of the most impactful outcomes of GAI in the HT industry is expected to be hyper-personalization on the demand side (Guszkowski, 2023; Lalli, 2023; Mondal et al., 2023). GAI can help HT businesses create personalized marketing content at scale (and without extensive human involvement) to enhance booking experiences and marketing communication. As an example, hotels can use GAI to create personalized social media posts for their guests based on their preferences and past behavior. Such systems could analyze data such as the guest’s previous stays, dining preferences, and activities booked, and generate social media posts that exhibit relevant offers and experiences. Another example is the use of GAI to create personalized recommendations for customers. A GAI system can market personalized travel itineraries, accommodation options, and activities by analyzing data on a customer’s past purchases, search history, and preferences. This can help businesses create engaging and relevant advertising and social media content, increasing customer interest and engagement. As evidence, Haleem and colleagues (2022) note that marketers can enhance ROI by analyzing consumer data and understanding their genuine desires without wasting resources on unsuccessful advertising attempts.

GAI can also be used to respond to comments on social media. Currently many companies only respond to a few selected comments simply because the human capital required to respond to every comment is cost-prohibitive. By using GAI to respond to customer or follower comments, the company will be able to increase consumer engagement on social media.

GAI can be especially helpful in dealing with unfavorable online reviews. GAI can review the sentiments expressed in online reviews and respond in real-time. Additionally, these responses can be individualized, rather than using the one-size-fits-all responses that are so often seen in such circumstances. By creating personalized responses to negative online reviews, GAI can aid in service recovery, satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word of mouth.

While these capabilities can certainly create value for both the company and the customer reading the reviews, there is a potential for value co-destruction as well. As online review sites become flooded with fake reviews that are generated by GAI, it may become impossible to trust any review at all. This may lead to the destruction of the familiar review and rating systems that exist currently, as they will no longer provide reliable information.

# Destination Management

GAI can be employed not only by individual companies, but also by destinations. At the travel decision level, GAI can add value to every stage of the trip from the anticipation and planning phase, to the trip to the site, the onsite experience, and the post-reflection phase of the trip. In the destination development stage, GAI can enable the development of more engaging, hyper-personalized tourism products, such as personalized travel guides based on individual preferences. For example, a

# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)

Travel guide could generate an itinerary for a day in Paris, focusing on museums per the traveler’s request. This travel guide can also adapt in real-time to factors such as the traveler’s mood or weather conditions, adjusting the itinerary to include more outdoor activities if the weather is nice. In addition to inspiring travelers and developing customized trip plans at the pre-trip stage, GAI can be integrated to the destination experience by offering navigation routes based on interests and preferences of visitors during the trip stage. Hence, GAI has the potential to replace guides and even local people to assist people during their travel. However, this loss of autonomy in travel-related decision making could also negatively affect the tourist experience resulting in value co-destruction (Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021).

# Human Resources and Talent Management

Staff training and development is a key area ripe for the infusion of GAI. Science-based GAI training can empower associates to develop exactly the skills they are lacking, as GAI will be able to identify areas in which the associate needs help, create an individualized training program, provide real-time feedback, and make shifts to the training program based on each person’s progress and success. Training and development are key factors in employee retention, and GAI can assist with this important initiative by developing highly relevant, hyper-personalized training and associate development.

GAI also has the potential to supplement human labor in the HT industry by reducing the need for humans to do repetitive and time-consuming tasks. This, in turn, can allow employees to focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, and customer interaction. While this could have positive effects in areas that struggle to hire and retain employees, particularly unskilled laborers, it does give rise to concerns over human employee displacement in many markets. While this is, of course, a concern in many segments of the economy, it is of particular concern in the HT industry, which is overwhelmingly comprised of unskilled workers and customer service employees. Thus, there exists the potential for value co-destruction from an employee perspective. However, GAI is also expected to create new jobs and tasks by transforming frontline service encounters and redefining HT jobs (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023).

# Demand, Supply, and Revenue Management

As a data-driven field, much of what is done in revenue management depends on the accurate forecasting of customer demand (Cross et al., 2009; Roberts, 2022; Talluri & van Ryzin, 2006). The advent of more sophisticated GAI algorithms is likely to advance the ability of revenue managers to access the vast amount of historical and current data in real-time to better model demand and predict customer purchase behavior, even over longer time horizons. In addition to being able to make more accurate forecasts, GAI will also be able to make pricing suggestions based on how actual demand and supply are developing in real-time. This would mean that updates to the booking curve, forecast adjustments, and changes in inventory allocations will also be possible in real-time. These possibilities have the potential to create a great deal of value for the firm in the form of maximized profits.

Thus, GAI systems will most certainly (partly) replace current revenue management practices that rely largely on human insight and interference. This may lead to the co-destruction of the field of revenue management as we now know it, displacing employees and rendering certain skill sets irrelevant. Moreover, HT firms must consider potential consumer backlash and the impact of algorithmic pricing, in particular online price discrimination, on perceived CSR performance (J.-P. van der Rest et al., 2022), and may have to develop the ability to detect, prevent, and mitigate such value co-destruction.

# Accounting and Finance

GAI has the potential for value co-creation in the accounting and finance discipline in several different ways. First, GAI models have the capability to produce AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants that offer improved, authentic, and contextually appropriate responses in conversational finance. Consequently, the utilization of generative AI can greatly enhance the effectiveness and user satisfaction of financial conversational AI systems by delivering precise, captivating, and sophisticated interactions with users. This technology can be applied externally to facilitate customer conversations, as well as internally within departments, enabling tasks like advancing an invoice through the approval process, thereby co-creating value for the firm, employees, suppliers, and customers.

Second, thanks to its comprehension of human language patterns and its capacity to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, GAI can offer precise and comprehensive answers to users’ financial inquiries. These models can be trained on extensive datasets of financial knowledge, enabling them to provide appropriate information and address a wide array of financial questions accurately.

One important potential for value co-destruction in the accounting and finance sector is data confidentiality. While data breaches and information leakages are already commonplace, leaked data is often somewhat hard to access, as one must know where to look for or how to access this information. However, once such financial data is leaked to GAI, it is then instantly available, in a user-friendly format, to the entire world. The potential for value co-destruction for a firm and its stakeholders in such a scenario is of serious concern.

domain of hospitality architecture and design. For example, GAI technology includes complex machine-learning algorithms with the ability to translate text into high-resolution 3D renderings. This gives rise to the potential for groups of target guest segments to participate in the research and design of HT spaces in real-time. For example, if a hotel company is designing new guest rooms, target guest segments can provide designers with direct feedback about what they want, and the rooms can be visualized from thematic analyses of their texts and rendered in seconds. Participants can then see the room, request changes, and add to the design.

Also, with access to extensive material databases, GAI can propose suitable materials for various architectural elements in the hospitality sector. By considering factors like durability, aesthetics, maintenance requirements, and sustainability, GAI models can help designers and architects make informed choices in selecting appropriate materials for flooring, wall coverings, fixtures, and more. Similarly, GAI can make suggestions on such design aspects as lighting and acoustics. By analyzing room dimensions, layout, and materials, AI algorithms can simulate and generate recommendations for enhancing sound quality, reducing noise pollution, and ensuring optimal acoustic experiences for guests in areas such as lobbies, restaurants, and conference rooms. By considering factors like natural light availability, room function, mood, and energy efficiency goals, AI algorithms can propose lighting configurations, fixture types, and automation strategies to create visually appealing and functional environments.

Despite these benefits, the use of GAI in hospitality design has the potential for value co-destruction, as well. Generative AI models are not infallible and can produce inaccurate or flawed outputs. If these errors are not detected, it could lead to faulty design decisions or suboptimal outcomes. Implementing GAI without appropriate validation and human oversight may result in design flaws or inefficient use of resources, negatively impacting stakeholders. Additionally, an over-reliance on the suggestions and designs of GAI may result in value destruction in terms of creativity. Generative AI models operate based on pre-existing data and patterns. While they can offer innovative suggestions, there is a risk that they may not consider certain unique or unconventional design ideas that could add value to a project. Relying solely on GAI recommendations might limit the exploration of groundbreaking concepts, stifling creativity and innovation.

# The REFLECT Framework and HT Stakeholders

As is evident from the examples in the preceding section, there are myriad applications of GAI at the firm level, some of which lead to co-creation of value, and some that can contribute to value co-destruction. Importantly, these value dynamics depend on the stakeholder from whose perspective GAI applications are being assessed. Thus, while the applications of GAI across various functional domains open new and exciting avenues for HT firms, there are several mediating factors that firms must navigate and potentially calibrate to maximize the reciprocal co-creation of value by and for the firm and its stakeholders, and minimize or eliminate value co-destruction.

To capture the spirit of the thoughtfulness that these factors require of HT business leaders, we identify them via the acronym REFLECT, which represents the various considerations of GAI use by HT firms: Resource-Based View of GAI, Ethical, Financial, Legal, (Internal) Educational, (Organizational) Cultural, and Technological Infrastructure. Thus, we recommend that HT business leaders filter the implementation of GAI in their firms through the REFLECT lens to more effectively co-create reciprocal value in the system. We discuss these various mediating factors in the section below. (Note that the factors are not discussed in the same order as the acronym itself, so as to provide better flow and continuity for some connected ideas represented in the various factors). While the GAI applications discussed in the previous section emphasized how the technology can allow HT firms to co-create value, the REFLECT factors, to a large extent, caution against the value co-destruction possibilities of GAI.

# Resource-Based View of GAI

The resource-based view of the firm posits that inter-firm competition is not an end state, but rather a dynamic process in which constant learning takes place on either side. A firm’s competitive advantage is determined by its internal resources, which can be strategically developed and exploited to achieve superior firm performance. These resources must be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and non-substitutable (J.-P. van der Rest & Roper, 2013). Such resources offer the firm a comparative advantage, allowing the company to produce goods and services that have either a higher value or a lower cost (or sometimes both) than those of its competitors. If managed appropriately, this comparative advantage in resources can translate into a competitive advantage for the firm in relation to their competitors. However, as the marketplace is in a constant state of flux, firms must constantly be monitoring their competitor’s performance, looking for clues about how the rival firm is acquiring, exploiting, and extracting value from resources in order to remain competitive. The focal firm learns from the actions of its competitor and then institutes new strategies to compete. At the same time, the rival firm is reciprocating this process and adjusting its own positioning. This inter-firm learning process is key to retaining market positioning and spurs innovation and forward growth for all concerned (J.-P. van der Rest & Roper, 2013). Over time, companies have spent millions of dollars and countless hours perfecting the systems and strategies through which they learn about their competitors. This may include things like data analytics, corporate espionage, and reverse engineering, to name just a few. However, because GAI is a

# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research

Continuous learning model and can make suggestions for strategies and actions based on the knowledge acquired, its advent may significantly impact the dynamic learning processes that take place. The form which this may take remains unclear, but one can foresee a situation in which Firm A is learning from Firm B, Firm B is learning from Firm A, and both are learning from GAI, but in different ways.

HT as an industry is inherently labor-intensive, and firms that can develop GAI capabilities, defined as “the ability of a firm to select, orchestrate, and leverage its [G]AI-specific resources” (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021, p. 2), can achieve competitive gains. Thus, based on the work of Mikalef and Gupta (2021) in the context of AI more generally, we posit that developing GAI capabilities goes beyond using GAI techniques and technologies (i.e., applications) that are easily acquired in the market and are subject to replication. Moreover, the data—both inherent and firm-specific—underlying these technologies is insufficient to create GAI capability. “Organizations require a unique blend of physical, human, and organizational resources to create an [G]AI capability, which can deliver value by differentiating it from that of competitors” (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021, p. 1). Thus, beyond adopting the GAI applications highlighted in the previous section, HT firms must make long-term and strategic investments into GAI as an organizational capacity that fundamentally transforms how the firm is structured and how it operates. Berg and colleagues (2023) make a similar argument when they state that for organizations to capture value from GAI, they must develop specific complementary assets that are different from those required for other forms of (discriminative) AI capabilities. Another way that HT firms could leverage a GAI capability to boost value creation is to use it to enhance other existing resources and capabilities. For example, by optimizing its supply chain via GAI, a hotel firm like Motel 6 may be able to further build on its core value proposition (of low prices) by offering even lower prices based on lower costs of inventory.

# Organizational Culture Considerations

Various studies have identified that an organization’s culture plays an important role in its adoption and use of AI (Behl et al., 2022; Dabbous et al., 2022) and, by extension, the development of its AI capability and organizational performance (Bley et al., 2022). According to Mikalef and Gupta (2021), “to unleash the value of [G]AI technologies, organizations must foster a culture of teamwork, collective goals, and shared resources” (p. 6). Individuals and teams across functional silos within HT firms must have a shared vision and foster a culture of open communication and collaboration, particularly as it pertains to the sharing of data that feeds GAI models. Thus, an organizational culture that cultivates a “sharing knowledge is power” environment versus a “knowledge is power” climate can more effectively leverage the knowledge management and deployment capabilities of the firm (Korzynski et al., 2023; Liebowitz, 2001), which, in turn, contribute to GAI capabilities. Relatedly, HT firms must look to build cross-functional teams that include data scientists, software developers, and subject matter experts from various departments to collaborate on AI projects and applications that co-create value for their stakeholders. This also necessitates a culture that embraces risk and places a premium on creativity and taking bold and radical actions (Berg et al., 2023), while placing an ethic of hospitality—and its associated value constellation of care, honesty, integrity, dignity, and respect for and towards its various stakeholders—as its guiding organizational principle (Mody, 2023). Thus, as offered by Mikalef and Gupta (2021), “developing an [G]AI orientation within the firm is a necessary precondition for successful deployments” (p. 14).

# Legal Considerations

While the increased use of personal information can lead to improved customer service recommendations and overall customer experience, it also leads to more regulation about the collection, storage, processing, and sharing of this information. GAI systems rely on vast amounts of data to function effectively. In the HT industry, this data often includes sensitive information such as personal details. For instance, chatbots handle travel plans, potentially including credit card information. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is crucial to ensuring compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws (Kuner, 2018). Consequently, HT organizations may find it difficult to comply with the increased regulation in data protection and privacy laws across borders. Some countries have more comprehensive data protection laws that restrict the use of AI and automated decision-making involving personal information. Other countries do not have a single comprehensive law regulating privacy and automated decision-making. The United States, for example, has a myriad of state laws that cover some aspects of data protection and privacy. The European Union (EU), on the other hand, has been much more proactive in creating consumer protection and privacy legislation, with the most comprehensive to date being the GDPR enacted in 2018.

In addition to legislation surrounding the protection of customer information held and used by companies, there are other GAI-specific regulations that are being drafted in the EU, China, and the United States. These regulations would require that companies developing GAI tools (such as the OpenAI platform that developed ChatGPT) meet strict requirements for the data used to train their algorithms (i.e., the input for GAI tools), including disclosing the use of copyrighted material. In this regard, the EU is mulling a tiered approach to regulating GAI, whereby, in addition to the makers of GAI models, one of the layers of regulation would be focused on “regulating relationships in the AI value chain.” Thus, it is likely that the users of GAI models,

# Dogru et al. - Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism

including HT organizations, may be required to have specific obligations to downstream stakeholders (customers, employees, etc.), including the need to explain how the model was trained, the use of copyrighted material, and the accuracy of the datasets from biases (Lomas, 2023). It would be legally incumbent upon HT organizations to ensure that the stakeholder data that serves as an additional input into the GAI models produces output that creates and does not destroy value. For example, if creating personalized marketing communications at scale, firms will need to ensure that the GAI model is sensitive to customers of various racial and gender backgrounds.

In addition, given the fact that GAI moves beyond predictive qualities and can act autonomously, it raises many interesting legal questions that may bring into consideration other non-GAI specific laws. One such question pertains to how we assign fault when a product that causes injury incorporates GAI. For example, who can a customer sue if they are “injured” by the hotel’s chatbot or GAI-based recommendation system? Or, if a customer is left stranded at the airport after a GAI tool handling a booking request makes a mistake and the reservation is not correctly completed? As such, injured individuals have begun to test the use of traditional legal theories, such as products liability. One can imagine a hypothetical case whereby a chatbot used by a restaurant to handle customer inquiries about ingredients, and, more specifically, about allergens, provides incorrect allergen information about a particular dish. A customer with a severe allergy to nuts relies on this information and eats the dish, resulting in an allergic reaction with significant damage. The customer files a lawsuit against the restaurant, alleging misrepresentation, negligence, and possibly products liability.

While many of these questions have yet to be determined by the courts, they are important to consider for HT operators when deciding on whether to use GAI and what preventive measures should be in place to protect guests and other stakeholders and prevent or minimize value co-destruction (Glaser & Niebla, 2023). Moreover, as far as the customer is concerned, whether the issue has been caused by a GAI system or not, the buck stops with the operator. Thus, companies using GAI need policies to handle these issues and to be ready to take responsibility for any problems caused by their AI systems, whether these systems were developed in-house or leased from a third party. Failure to do so may result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer/stakeholder trust. A case involving Delta Airlines provides evidence of these issues. In 2019, the airline sued a vendor of GAI-based customer service technology, [24]7.ai, for a breach of passenger data. Allegedly, the vendor had a weak password for its systems, which allowed a hacker to access its code and subsequently scrape the names, addresses, and full credit card details of up to 825,000 Delta customers. Delta took all the necessary steps to take care of its customers, including notifying them promptly and paying for free credit monitoring products for affected passengers (O’Neill, 2019). However, the reputational damage caused to the airline, as reflected in negative PR and consumer class action lawsuits, goes beyond the legal issues pertaining to the use of the GAI technology itself and raises larger questions of accountability and legal liability. In this regard, as J. P. I. van der Rest and colleagues (2020) determined, in the context of personalized pricing practices, “we argue that not much is to be expected from the legal system, at least not in the short run” (p. 113), regarding GAI applications by HT firms and implementing minimum standards of behavior. HT firms can mitigate legal challenges by adopting a holistic value creation perspective—such as that offered by the REFLECT model—accounting for the needs and experiences of various stakeholders.

# Ethical Considerations

Beyond the legal aspects of the collection and use of customer (or stakeholder) data, there are important ethical considerations for HT firms that use GAI-based technology. The first issue pertains to privacy, which relates to the question “Who owns and controls the data, and how can it be used?” GAI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, such as browsing history, location data, and social media activity, to generate personalized recommendations or content. For example, AI-powered systems that collect and analyze customer data for creating personalized menus need to ensure that data are collected and used in a transparent, secure, and ethical manner, with clear consent and privacy measures in place. Are customers given the option to opt-out of their data being collected? Can they choose which components of their data they would like to share or how the data will be shared with third-party systems outside of the company collecting the data?

Another ethical consideration is the potential for GAI systems to perpetuate biases and stereotypes (N. T. Lee et al., 2019). The current GAI systems mostly rely on Western sources with less input from other parts of the world, and hence may lack the necessary diversity of race, gender, ethnicity, age, education, beliefs, and so on. If these systems are trained on biased data, or if their algorithms incorporate biased assumptions, they can produce content that reinforces existing stereotypes or discriminates against certain groups of people, particularly around race, gender, and ethnicity (Pazzanese, 2020). This can be particularly problematic in the HT industry, where such biases can lead to discriminatory practices in hiring, marketing, and customer service. For example, if a hotel’s AI system recommends spa treatments to female customers or golf courses primarily to male customers, or suggests types of cuisine only to customers from specific racial or ethnic backgrounds, it would reinforce harmful stereotypes and exclusionary practices or even perpetuate unhealthy eating practices. This would not only be unethical, but it would also damage the hotel’s reputation and lead to a loss of customers.

# Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research

analyzes a variety of resumes for recruitment at hotels or restaurants. However, there is an ethical risk that the trained data in ChatGPT may be biased and less prone to recommend historically discriminated groups to managers or more inclined to provide lower-paying jobs to underrepresented groups. This can perpetuate discrimination and inequality in the workplace, leading to a lack of diversity and a negative impact on employee morale and job satisfaction.

In this regard, Zhuo and colleagues (2023) evaluated ChatGPT with respect to four critical ethical considerations: bias, reliability, robustness, and toxicity. While these considerations were developed in the context of a specific GAI tool (ChatGPT), they can be extrapolated to the use of GAI more broadly, as a filter for the firm’s value creation efforts. In this context, Zhuo and colleagues (2023) argue that GAI models are trained on a vast amount of data, and thus any biases (implicit and explicit) within the data can provide unfair or discriminatory arguments or suggestions toward people from different cultures and/or those who use different languages, which can affect users’ perception of fairness and lead to a lack of inclusivity. It is important to highlight that the current GAI technology is based on existing databases, which might have limitations on diverse and inclusive perspectives in decision-making and communications (Dwivedi et al., 2023a). Hence, discrimination toward customers and employees may potentially be experienced due to this limitation.

Furthermore, another crucial ethical concern associated with GAI is robustness, defined as “a model’s ability to maintain its performance when given input that is semantically (the meaning of input) or syntactically (the structure of input) different from the input it was trained on” (Zhuo et al., 2023, p. 3). As an example, ChatGPT can be used by international tourists as a language translator. In such cases, ChatGPT must accurately translate new sentences, although the language used is unfamiliar. For instance, if ChatGPT was trained in the formal French language, it should still be able to accurately translate informal “slang” sentences.

Zhuo and colleagues (2023) further postulate that reliability and toxicity is a critical ethical issue related to GAI. First, disseminating false, misleading, misconstrued, or outdated information can contribute to forming conspiracy theories that cause harm and lead to poor decision-making. Often, language models such as ChatGPT can even fabricate sources that do not actually exist. Thus, for example, ChatGPT can manipulate online reviews of hotels or restaurants or mass-create thousands of accounts with false identities. Second, the concern is those models can generate or comprehend harmful or offensive content while interacting with users. For instance, if the GAI used in applications such as customer service chatbots or voice assistants in hotel rooms is trained on datasets that contain racist, sexist, or pornographic content, it can lead to the generation of offensive and harmful communication when interacting with guests. Relatedly, users may attempt to “jailbreak” a GAI application into producing toxic content. For example, a guest could co-create a conversation that tricks the AI into using words or engaging in conversation involving racial slurs (Hachman, 2023) or outright lies (Carter, 2023), which may open the doors to legal consequences.

# Financial Considerations

The use of GAI by HT companies will involve significant financial implications and considerations. Managers need to implement a rigorous cost-benefit analysis before adopting AI technologies, including GAI applications (Ivanov & Webster, 2018). In terms of direct costs, the use of third-party GAI is associated with monthly or annual subscription fees to access the application. These can range significantly—from a few tens of dollars per month to a few thousand per month, depending on the capabilities of the application, the requirements of the organization (and, relatedly, any specifications or modifications) and the competition on the GAI market. Some AI providers, such as ChatGPT give free access to their GAI application for a limited period or for a limited number of generated images/words/symbols. This freemium option allows users to get acquainted with and test the product before they subscribe to it, which decreases the perceived risk of purchase of the premium options. Other indirect costs relate to the investment needed to train the GAI application(s) with the company’s data to allow it to provide specific solutions to the company’s needs and to train employees to use the applications effectively.

In terms of benefits, GAI can improve the profitability of HT companies in several ways. First, it can save costs associated with purchasing photos from databases, text copywriting, and hiring professional actors to appear in ads and read text, among others. The integration of GAI (e.g., ChatGPT) into a chatbot can improve its efficiency in interacting with customers and decrease the need for human employees to intervene, thus reducing labor costs. Of course, the current level of development of GAI has not reached the point where it can deliver output with error-free quality. In fact, the generated output (text, photo, etc.) may be incorrect, not relevant, or not specific enough, thus sometimes requiring human intervention. However, the more human-like interactions with a GAI-based chatbot as compared to other chatbots may have a direct positive impact on revenue since the information provided by the application can be more relevant and personalized to the needs of potential customers (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023). Additionally, the speed of generating text and visuals, their quality and variety, allow HT managers to develop marketing communication campaigns that use versatile visuals and text, have more versions of ads that could appeal to and attract more customer segments and, hence, indirectly contribute to the company’s revenue.

Beyond these functional and administrative applications, HT managers can also apply GAI in strategic decision-making that has implications for the financial health and performance of the firm (Korzynski et al., 2023). For example, HT

# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism

Managers can leverage GAI capabilities to analyze competitor strategies, customer profiles, employee performance, financial statements, and other factors that impact business operations. These insights can then be used to make decisions on sales, staffing, inventory management, and other cost-related areas to improve overall business efficiency and profitability. Moreover, the ideas that GAI provides about new products, branding, promotion, pricing strategies, business models, and design may trigger the creativity and innovativeness of HT managers to improve the marketing and operational processes in their companies, their competitiveness, and thus improve revenue and profitability.

# (Internal) Education Considerations

In 2018, nearly 8,000 Marriott workers across seven U.S. cities went on strike to raise their concerns about the implementation of various AI technologies that were perceived as threatening to their jobs; applications such as robots delivering room service, check-in kiosks with facial recognition technology, and smart speakers that serve as an in-room concierge (Durbin, 2018). Such reactions are consistent with research that has shown that AI disruption and job replacement threats cause anxiety and job insecurity (e.g., Lingmont & Alexiou, 2020). Furthermore, employees contemplate leaving the organization before their jobs are replaced by AI (Li et al., 2019). Relatedly, GAI might exacerbate employees’ concerns about the security of their jobs due to its ability to perform more tasks with increasing accuracy. In addition, GAI may disrupt the relationships between HT employees and their organizations by inadvertently harming employees’ well-being, leading to undesirable job-related outcomes such as cynicism, depression, and burnout. The risk of replacement by GAI, accompanied by negative work-related outcomes associated with the adoption of GAI, might trigger HT employees to sabotage these GAI-powered applications (e.g., chatbots) and the employer. For example, GAI can be used as a retaliatory tool in which employees could enter a misleading prompt, which, in turn, yields unreliable, harmful, and biased responses that eventually result in lost customers and harm to brand reputation. Likewise, HT employees can also shift the blame and responsibility to GAI when they deliberately engage in workplace misbehavior and a service failure occurs. Also, the use of GAI can result in ambiguity in the workplace. For instance, when a service failure is encountered or high-quality service is not delivered, it might be challenging to determine who is accountable: the employee or the GAI application.

To counter these negative outcomes, along with developing an organizational culture that enables GAI capability, a structured approach to educating internal stakeholders—particularly employees—is necessary to ensure that they are ready for the changes associated with GAI adoption and have a thorough understanding of the technology and its potential applications. The fear of the unknown is driven by a lack of understanding. This may be particularly true for the HT industry, where much work is still manual and labor-intensive in nature, and employees performing such work are often not fluent in technology and its use. Thus, firms must invest in training that starts by explaining what GAI is, how it differs from other types of artificial intelligence, and its current and anticipated applications in the particular HT setting. For example, housekeepers who may be worried about cleaning robots taking over their jobs can be assured that GAI is largely used to generate new content, such as images, text, and audio, and cannot be used to replace any of the tasks they perform.

For employees whose jobs may be impacted by GAI, such as concierges or customer service representatives responding to guest comments on TripAdvisor, it may be important to educate them on the fact that GAI can work hand in hand with human employees and handle repetitive and mundane tasks, enabling employees to focus on the more important and creative components of their jobs (Lee et al., 2023b). For instance, a GAI application could offer a first draft of a response to a negative guest feedback, and a human representative could vet, enhance, and further personalize the response, saving time and effort and providing a high-level recovery experience to the guest. For other employees whose jobs may be more significantly impacted by GAI, such as individuals in areas like marketing or customer experience and/or those working in more senior analytical roles, firms will have to provide the necessary resources for upskilling employees to achieve the desired synergistic culmination of human–machine competencies (Jaiswal et al., 2022). As highlighted by the Society for Human Resource Management, “if leaders don’t engage in an open dialogue with workers around GAI, then we’re just hoping they will understand, and a lot of them won’t, and those are the ones who will be left behind” (Folz, 2023). In addition, particularly for employees whose jobs will involve the use of GAI, they will need to be trained in the ethical implications of using GAI around the issues of bias, transparency, accuracy, accountability and data privacy, and security.

# Technology Infrastructure Considerations

A lack of technology infrastructure is one of the main barriers in adopting AI, including GAI, in organizations. Technology infrastructure refers not only to the hardware components associated with data storage, transfer, and processing/computing systems, but also to the softer infrastructure that includes the data itself (how it is generated and fed into the system), and the technical and business skills needed to effectively and efficiently implement and realize GAI algorithms (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). In this context, HT firms will have to ensure that it integrates with existing technology infrastructure, including operational platforms like property management systems for hotels, third-party systems like content management platforms for...

# Discussion and Conclusions

The introduction of GAI as a dynamic organizational capability for HT firms is predicted to have a dramatic impact on the industry. GAI has potential to create value for HT stakeholders in a transformative manner through the integration of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies (Dwivedi et al., 2023a; Sandstrom & Dunn, 2014). Rapid advancements in GAI will likely bring disruptive changes to the HT industry and transform how the HT industry approaches operations, marketing, destination management, human resources, revenue management, accounting and finance, design, and other operational strategies (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023a).

As such, GAI can be a technological tool that creates value for HT stakeholders by enhancing guest experience with human interaction when it is most needed while allowing GAI technology to address the repetitive and otherwise mundane tasks, and employees to engage in more creative tasks, leading to a better work-life balance for HT employees. It has the potential to generate a higher level of personalized products and services, elevate the guest experience, and build loyalty. GAI enriches guest experiences, maximizes revenues, reduces cost, and increases profitability. It also provides shareholders with more transparent and accurate insights regarding an organization’s financial health, and may help keep associates in the HT workforce longer and attract a new generation of HT leaders.

While effective GAI implementation leads to value co-creation, ineffective management of the GAI applications could lead to value co-destruction by and for HT stakeholders. An over-reliance on GAI might create a perception that GAI-produced content and solutions are always more reliable, which may destroy collaborative organizational culture and lead to a climate of higher psychological competition, creating a toxic work environment, causing disunity, harming employees’ well-being, and leading to undesirable job-related outcomes, such as cynicism, depression, and burnout. For customers, the extensive integration of GAI may lead to a loss of autonomy in decision-making and overburden them and reduce or eliminate human interactions that are essential to HT experiences, which may result in value co-destruction (Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021). Sensitive customer information may be at risk of unauthorized access, manipulation, or misuse, leading to privacy violations and potential loss of trust in service providers.

The use of GAI-produced content raises further concerns about intellectual property and copyright infringement, as well as the authenticity and credibility of information provided to customers. The creation of false or misleading content by GAI could lead to disappointment or even danger for consumers, possibly resulting in customers being stranded or experiencing a significant inconvenience due to reliance on inaccurate information generated by GAI. Furthermore, GAI-driven recommendations might reinforce stereotypes or marginalize certain groups, leading to biased or discriminatory outcomes, where HT firms could face grave, service, reputational, and legal consequences. However, by embracing the potential of GAI, while considering its limitations and ethical issues, HT firms can embrace this disruptive technology and offer a more creative, effective, and inclusive experience for customers, employees, managers, and other HT stakeholders (Lee et al., 2023a, 2023b). Devised according to the tenets of stakeholder theory, the REFLECT model offers a comprehensive and clear understanding of the dynamics of value co-creation and co-destruction via GAI implementation by HT firms, and provides a theoretical and practical roadmap for this exciting technology.

# Theoretical and Research Implications

While limited, several studies have discussed the applications and potential implications of GAI in the context of the HT industry, research, and education. However, while discussing the use of this technology is important, conceptualizing and analyzing its potential impact on stakeholders from a value perspective is more important. Additionally, the applications for the HT industry have been discussed in an ad hoc and disorganized manner, and the primary focus of the implications has been limited to research and education. Moreover, extant studies mainly emphasize the legal and ethical issues that might arise from GAI applications. In the present study, we go beyond discussing GAI applications for research and education and the potential legal and ethical impacts resulting from the use of GAI in HT contexts. We present a wide range of GAI applications for the HT industry and propose a conceptual framework that provides a comprehensive account of the GAI impacts on HT stakeholders. This framework integrates the resource-based view of GAI, ethical, financial, legal, (internal) education, (organizational) culture, and technology infrastructure (REFLECT) mechanisms and is based on the perspectives of 30 HT academics and practitioners with expertise in various HT domains. Consistent with the work of Freudenreich and colleagues (2020), the REFLECT model aims “to support theoretical and empirical analyses of value creation [via GAI] as well as the management and transformation of business models in line with corporate sustainability ambitions and stakeholder expectations” (p. 3).

# Generative Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality and Tourism

Our proposed framework indicates that the application of GAI can result in both the co-creation of value and the co-destruction of value for a variety of stakeholders, and these effects can be mediated by the HT firm via calibration of the various REFLECT-based mechanisms. The reciprocal nature of the relationship between various HT stakeholders and GAI applications in the proposed integrative framework is portrayed by a feedback loop where the benefits of using GAI to facilitate value co-creation for some HT stakeholders might, in turn, lead to co-destruction of value for other stakeholders due to friction in these relationships. However, value co-destruction can be mitigated while value co-creation is enhanced by effective applications of GAI through the REFLECT factors. Furthermore, this integrative conceptual framework offers opportunities for future theoretical, methodological, and empirical research in the context of the nexus between GAI and HT stakeholders.

# Practical Implications

Although GAI is an exciting technological development, ultimately, HT is a people industry and will always involve people serving people. Utilizing GAI technology solutions, which work in tandem with consumers, employees, managers, and other HT stakeholders, is necessary to provide greater capabilities and to co-create value for HT stakeholders. Therefore, HT firms should navigate the applications of GAI through several mediating factors (i.e., REFLECT) to facilitate reciprocal value co-creation and to minimize or eliminate potential value co-destruction.

HT firms should make long-term and strategic investment decisions when implementing GAI applications and leverage their GAI capability to improve other existing resources and capabilities (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). In so doing, HT firms can fundamentally transform their organizational capacity and how they are structured and operated. Furthermore, the insights generated by GAI applications can be used to make strategic sales, staffing, inventory management, supply chain management, and other cost-related decisions to increase overall business efficiency and profitability. Also, GAI should be utilized to generate new products and services, offer creative branding and promotion strategies, and to develop pricing strategies, business models, and design to advance operational activities, competitiveness, and revenues.

HT leaders should shepherd careful integration of GAI in the workplace, considering the perception of employees. Implementation of GAI will likely eliminate some existing jobs and create new ones in the HT industry (Carvalho & Ivanov, 2023; Iskender, 2023). It will also likely change the nature and requirements of other jobs. Accordingly, HT firms need to invest in reskilling and retraining programs to ensure continued employment opportunities in the changing work environment, which necessitates collaboration between humans and GAI. However, not all jobs will be affected or lost due to GAI applications. Therefore, HT firms need to train their respective employees and provide a sense of comfort and ensure job security in this context.

GAI without the monitoring function could create an asymmetric risk for HT industry and might turn HT experiences into value co-destruction events for consumers, employees, firms, and other HT stakeholders. Therefore, HT organizations should explain to all stakeholders—internal and external—how their GAI models are trained, whether and how copyrighted materials are used, which consumer and employee data are fed into the GAI, and the extent to which datasets are accurate and free from biases (Lomas, 2023). Although many aspects of GAI applications in the context of liability and accountability have yet to be determined, HT firms should develop internal policies to protect their guests and other stakeholders from potential ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise due to use of GAI. In so doing, HT firms ensure that GAI models produce output that creates and captures (not destroys) value for HT stakeholders in reciprocal means while providing the necessary security and privacy protections.

# Future Research Directions

As with any transformative technology, GAI also poses ethical, social, legal, and economic challenges that require careful consideration. Otherwise, premature implementation of GAI might lead to value-destruction for HT stakeholders. Therefore, many research questions remain to be answered to evaluate the efficacy of this technological tool in value creation for HT stakeholders. Accordingly, we postulated 50 research questions, some overarching, and some pertaining to the various components of our framework. The research questions were then rated by the 30 coauthors of this study on a 5-point importance scale ranging from “not at all important” to “extremely important.” Subsequently, each research question was categorized according to its primary focus: overarching, application-based, REFLECT-based, and stakeholder-based questions, and the questions were ranked within their respective category based on their level of importance according to survey results. Table 1 provides an account of these questions as rated by the authors of this research on a 5-point importance scale.

Answering these questions will shed light on the implications of the GAI for stakeholders in the HT domain including scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and policymakers. However, it is important to emphasize that the list of future research questions proposed in this study is by no means exhaustive, and many more research questions will continue to emerge as GAI technology makes further progress and its adoption increases.

In addition to the comprehensive list of research questions proposed above, further theoretical and empirical examination of the GAI technology will be necessary to contribute to our understanding of the theoretical, practical, policy, and...

managerial implications of GAI for HT stakeholders. From a theoretical perspective, while we presented a comprehensive and integrative conceptual framework that explains the reciprocal value co-creation and value co-destruction process through the mediating REFLECT factors from a HT stakeholder perspective, future research is needed to examine each component of the REFLECT factors and its effect on the relationship between the application of GAI and HT stakeholders in greater detail. We also illustrated the reciprocal value co-creation and value co-destruction process with detailed examples. However, future research is necessary to delineate this reciprocal process in the context of each GAI application.

Furthermore, the effects of GAI applications to the HT industry, consumers, employees, firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders should be further assessed utilizing alternative theories and conceptual frameworks. One such theory might be disruptive innovation theory (Christensen, 2013), where GAI might very well be considered as a disruptive innovation for the HT industry. The Technology Acceptance Model might be utilized to explain the implications of GAI and whether HT stakeholders would be willing to use GAI in the HT industry (Arici et al., 2023; Davis, 1986). In the context of GAI’s impact on employment, Leader-Member-Exchange theory might be appropriate to investigate GAI’s impact on employment issues. Alternatively, qualitative work may need to be conducted to conceptualize new theories to understand this new work dynamic that incorporates GAI applications.

The focus of GAI adoption should be on enhancing tourists’ well-being through tourism experiences, and communities’ quality of life through efficient tourism development (Uysal et al., 2020). Therefore, future research is necessary to investigate the extent to which widespread GAI adoption may affect quality of life.

In this study, much of our discussion was primarily focused on the short-term, immediate applications of GAI adoption. However, the extent to which GAI applications can contribute to the corporate social responsibility efforts of HT stakeholders requires further attention and investigation. GAI’s role in enhancing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in HT firms and beyond needs to be analyzed and discussed in future research. ESG and various sustainability, societal marketing, and corporate social responsibility issues demand a long-term view (Dogru et al., 2022). Therefore, the extent to which HT firms can utilize GAI as a practical tool to enhance long-term welfare and social good for customers and other stakeholders, is one of the most important avenues for future research.

Empirical investigations of the effects of GAI on the HT industry will shed more light on the practical and policy implications of GAI adoption. Utilizing stakeholder theory, disruptive innovation theory, Leader-Member-Exchange theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and so on, future studies should develop GAI-specific scales, operationalize the constructs, collect data, and empirically and extensively.

Analyze the effect of GAI on HT stakeholders. Specifically, future research is needed to investigate the value of GAI-enabled experiences and to examine whether an optimum level of GAI-enabled experience exists that provides a higher level of satisfaction for consumers, employees, and other stakeholders. Also, the effect of GAI applications might be different across different service segments in the HT domain. While GAI might be well perceived and needed in economy scale hotels or fast-food restaurants, luxury hotel guests and fine dining restaurant patrons might seek more human interaction. Indeed, luxury in the future could include the ability to interact with humans versus GAI only. As former Loews Hotels President and CEO Kinsell (2022) once stated, “Service comes from a manual; hospitality comes from the heart.” This noble expression provokes an important question in this new age: Can technology, like GAI, even without heartbeats, deliver heartfelt hospitality? This important question should be investigated in a comprehensive manner utilizing qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. Also, analyzing the problems that such adoption may cause to HT stakeholders will be necessary as companies start adopting GAI extensively in the HT industry.

To further explore the potential benefits of GAI for HT firms, future studies need to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of investing in the GAI ecosystem and to test whether GAI-related platforms help achieve better financial gains. Future research needs to delve into the economic aspects of the implementation of GAI in companies and assess the actual impacts of GAI on companies’ revenue, costs, productivity, and competitiveness. There are also risks associated with GAI, including data breaches, bias, discriminatory behavior, and the potential for decreased human interaction. Hence, the risk component of GAI can be evaluated in future research endeavors to see the best ways to mitigate these risks and create corresponding strategies. Although ethical and legal implications have been discussed in detail in this study, context-specific ethical and legal implications of GAI, such as privacy, security transparency, accountability, biases and stereotyping, and intellectual property rights, are the key areas to be analyzed further.

GAI has important implications for HT research and education as well; however, for GAI initiatives to be successfully implemented in creating value for stakeholders, HT research and education institutions need to strategically integrate GAI as an aiding tool for research, teaching, and education, by developing clear policies and guidelines for scholars, educators, and students in utilizing GAI. Further research is necessary to investigate the implications of GAI for research and higher education in HT.

Abstract: Supply chain management environmental and social criteria are practical and research concerns due to regulatory, stakeholder, and economic pressures. Effective holistic sustainable supply management schemes require the evaluation and selection of suppliers. Supplier evaluation requires the balancing of multiple criteria. Multiple criteria tools, each with advantages and limitations, are necessary for the supplier evaluation and selection problem. This paper introduces a new methodological approach including complementary, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques and Bayesian networks (BN). The combination of DEMATEL, AHP and Bayesian approaches, although they are supportive and complementary methods, has seen limited investigation. The Bayesian network approach can complement DEMATEL and AHP to help improve the accuracy of AHP input data. Alternatively, DEMATEL and AHP can provide expert and more objective inputs for intangible factors, used in the Bayesian network approach. The validity and efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a real industrial case using decision-makers’ inputs and outputs. The study shows the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we present results with managerial and research implications and future research directions.

# 1. Introduction

In today’s business environment, most organizations have realized the critical nature of the relationship with suppliers and the importance of the strategic decision to evaluate and choose the best suppliers. Thus, many organizations refer to their suppliers as partners. On the other hand, organizations need to coordinate all their business activities, considering sustainability issues to gain competitive advantages [1]. Therefore, this relationship is no longer based on economic aspects.

Selecting a supplier is a strategic decision from multiple perspectives including customer satisfaction, technological ability and general business performance. Expanding this issue through sustainable supply chain management makes the choice and evaluation of suppliers even more critical and complex. Not surprisingly, the literature on sustainability and supplier selection (SS) is increasing. If selecting a supplier is a complex issue, selecting a sustainable supplier is even more complex. The dimensions to consider increase geometrically. New techniques that provide insightful knowledge and practical tools are required.

The implementation of sustainable practices is affected by different external factors. Ref. [1] stressed the necessity to be more involved not only in the internal process but also including.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

the inter-organizational business systems and relationship with partners along the supply chain. Moreover, the implementation of sustainable initiatives is a complicated task without the cooperation with all partners in supply chain network. Therefore, the selection of suppliers based on integrated sustainability criteria using relevant methods can help companies to improve their sustainability performance. However, many present decision-making models regarding supplier selection focus on economic and environmental issues and less on social factors [2].

Many studies have reviewed the literature on supplier selection (SS) [3–5]. Indeed, the literature on supplier selection is extensive. Multiple criteria decision-making model (MCDM), mathematical programming (MP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are some of the more popular approaches [6]. MCDM provides a methodological framework for decision support systems; MP is used to optimize or evaluate SS; AI identifies approximate solutions for complex optimization problems. MCDM approaches are the most popular, and within MCDM, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is most often applied [7]. AHP is very effective in ranking and selecting decision problems. It could be used alone or combined with other methods. Interaction and interdependent relationships among the evaluation criteria are critical and should be considered in order to evaluate a sustainable supplier [8]. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) can be valuable for this purpose.

In practical decision-making situations, the supplier selection problem is uncertain and imprecise. In risk assessment, researchers consider Bayesian network (BN) analysis as a helpful methodology for decision support under uncertainty. Although Bayesian analysis has been used for this issue [9], BN has not been used.

More precisely, more efforts are needed to take advantage of efficient techniques for selecting sustainable supplier in real cases [9]. In this sense, this research aims to answer the following research question: how to improve sustainable supplier selection and evaluation by using complementary approaches?

Given this situation, this study has the following objectives to answer the identified research question:

- To provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem;
- To propose a new decision-making tool using combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods in an uncertain environment for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers;
- To validate the proposed approach in a real case and provide some managerial and research insights.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature about supplier selection (SS) and sustainability in order to provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem. AHP, DEMATEL and BN for supplier selection problems will be the focus. The new approach, AHP-DEMATEL-BN, is explained and tested with a real case study in Section 3. The results are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes and suggests some research avenues.

# 2. Literature Review

Many studies have demonstrated the importance of the supplier selection decision and its impact on overall supply chain network efficiency. Although SS is largely studied, the literature on sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem is more limited [10]. SSS has been receiving more attention in recent years. Prior to 2005, there were only few papers, more or less one per year on SSS topics, reaching around 38 papers in 2014 [5]. Sustainable supplier selection faces similar methodological trends as those observed in supplier selection research. We shall only introduce some papers that have used the tools, separately, that we integrate in this study, to provide a foundation of the state-of-the-art modeling studies.

The literature considers multiple aspects of supplier selection. Sometimes, the focus is on a particular sustainability dimension. For example, the economic aspect for ranking suppliers is studied using AHP according to some criteria such as price, quality, delivery, and service using the case

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

of the automotive industry in the developing country of Pakistan [ 11 ]. The authors highlighted the importance of developing a simple methodology for managers of the automotive industry so that they can select the best suppliers.

AHP as a standalone method has been used for evaluating criteria and ranking suppliers based on corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions [ 12 ]. These dimensions include human rights, underage labor, female labor, low working hours, pollution, safeguarding mechanisms and organizational legal responsibilities.

AHP has been also combined with a variety of methods; showing the flexibility of this tool, which we take advantage of in this study as well. As an example, some have used AHP to prioritize criteria and then VIKOR to rank suppliers [13 ]. Other studies identify the best sustainable supplier in similar ways but utilize TOPSIS instead of VIKOR as in [14]. Some studies have expanded supplier evaluation to multiple supply chain levels using these techniques [ 15 ]. Integration of statistical uncertainties into these joint MCDM models has not been explicitly completed.

Studies have also sought to link DEMATEL as a technique with MCDM approaches in order to consider interactions among criteria with selection purposes, e.g., [ 16 ]. Suggestions to add some sustainable criteria into these joint models have also appeared in studies [17, 18]. These and other works further highlight the necessity to integrate social criteria to advance their models [19].

Some studies have applied BN to supplier selection. BN can model the uncertainty and vagueness of human information [20 ]. It translates the decision-maker’s knowledge into probabilistic relationships. BN is capable of capturing tangible and intangible variables [21]. It is capable of integrating a learning process [ 22 ]. This integrative characteristic makes it even more valuable for the supplier selection process, since there are numerous uncertainties, from objective performance to intangible characteristics such as relational building. The relationship graphs within BN provide insights into the decision-maker’s understanding and thought processes. BN has traditionally been used as a standalone approach, and it can integrate broader frameworks [22 ]. For example, linking BN and total cost of ownership gives a dual perspective to buyer–supplier decision-makers [ 20, 23]. The malleability of BN and its advantages can help to address the disadvantages of other techniques that may not show a good path and uncertainty effectively.

DEMATEL may be used to elicit the BN structure. This rare integrative model is not a decision tool but is used for the structured analysis of relationships [19]. Adding MCDM methods to support decision-making has been recommended for this integrative approach. A recommended research avenue is to reinforce the descriptive model in using MCDM methods with DEMATEL and BN [ 24 ]. It is this additional step which we take—one that complements each of the various tools, allowing for more robust decision-making and analysis for sustainable supplier selection modeling.

In sustainable supplier selection (SSS), only two studies have used BN or Bayesian approaches [9, 25 ]. A Bayesian framework is provided and tested with an illustrative example to select a supplier for sustainable operations [ 9 ]. The resilience of suppliers in using forward and backward propagation analysis is studied [25 ], but not specifically for sustainable suppliers. The authors integrate resilience, green and primary indicators in their model. Then, they test it with a numerical sample. These studies have utilized operational criteria such as lead time, cost and quality alongside green criteria such as carbon emissions and environmental practices. They stipulate that other criteria need to be incorporated into their models. They indicate that further investigation needs to be extended to other supply chains and real data.

In our study, an additional research avenue is to apply the extended model of [ 24 ] to a real case of sustainable supplier evaluation and selection as suggested by [9]. A summary of studies in supplier selection problems is presented in Table 1, focusing on methods and types of decision criteria according to the triple bottom line (TBL) approach for supplier selection and evaluation.

The following is a summary of observations of the sustainable supplier selection problem and current methods are based on the literature review presented in this section:

- The three techniques are frequently used in the literature and combined with other techniques that help to build on each other’s capabilities, overcoming some of their weaknesses.
- Despite the large number of studies proposing the use of AHP, DEMATEL and BN (Table 1), there is no study that considers sustainability criteria and examines the interrelationships among them in order to evaluate and select the right supplier using AHP-DEMATEL-BN simultaneously.
- There is still limited literature that illustrates the use of these methods through a case example for the sustainable supplier selection problem in a practical and actual manufacturing setting.

Thus, the main purpose of this research work is to propose a new approach for sustainable partner selection by combining various decision-making techniques, taking advantage of their complementarities and addressing their weaknesses. An attempt is made to identify relevant evaluation criteria including sustainability aspects. This research work proposes a combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN framework for selecting the best sustainable supplier. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is an original effort in evaluating the suppliers in a real sustainable supply chain network based on the combination of these powerful techniques.

# 3. The AHP-DEMATEL-BN Approach

The contextual setting of this study is determining whether a supplier is a good partner for an organization, taking into consideration economic, environmental and social dimensions with uncertainties and limited information. Therefore, we propose a hydride approach based on AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods. Furthermore, the reasons and complementarities for combining AHP-DEMATEL-BN in this study include:

- AHP evaluates the decision problems hierarchically by decomposing the complex problem into simpler subproblems, while the DEMATEL approach effectively evaluates decision-makers’ priorities at an initial level of decision-making. The supplier selection problem is decomposed to three goal levels, sustainable aspects and criteria. The importance weights of each sustainability dimension for decision makers are calculated using AHP. Then, these weights are integrated into a BN model.
- AHP does not consider relations among the evaluation criteria and assumes that they are independent. DEMATEL’s complementarity deals with this issue. Using DEMATEL, the causal relations among the evaluation criteria are analyzed and the initial causal graph is proposed to build the BN model.
- AHP and DEMATEL cannot be used alone as a decision-making tool to explicitly evaluate uncertainties and limited information. However, BNs have dominant properties for making probabilistic calculations despite the unknown information for some evaluation criteria.
- By combining AHP, DEMATEL and BN, we model the sustainable supplier performance from both short-term and long-term viewpoints.

The proposed hybrid AHP-DEMATEL-BN approach is organized into five main steps as summarized in Figure 1.

Thus, we demonstrate an example depicted from a practical, real-life case problem in order to illustrate and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The situation discussed here is faced by an actual international manufacturing company.

The company has one site in France. It manufactures innovative industrial products for business clients by working on reducing water and energy consumption. It is a pioneering innovator in environmental approaches; it was recognized as a leader in environmental protection by the United States Agency for Environmental Protection and has been ISO14001 certified since 1997, with one of the earliest certifications in the world.

The manufacturing company wishes to evaluate its current and potential suppliers before choosing them for partnering. The company considers key factors affecting the sourcing functional efficiencies. The supplier is also evaluated and chosen using various sustainability criteria as part of the strategic organizational goal to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, the company has two suppliers, identified as S1 and S2. It has also another potential supplier, S3.

The study was conducted between September 2019 and February 2020. We started by a face-to-face meeting with different managers including a purchasing manager (DM1), a logistics manager (DM2) and a supply chain director (DM3) in the company under study. The objective of this meeting was first to better understand the problem and to validate the criteria found in the literature for the supplier selection problem with experts. Later, the same three decision-makers participated in each stage.

Thus, in the AHP stage, the three DMs in the company concerned was asked to answer a questionnaire including all possible pairwise comparisons for criteria. The questionnaire was presented in an Excel worksheet and sent by email for managers DM1, DM2, DM3. They jointly completed the questionnaire of the possible pairwise comparisons as they wanted to prioritize the criteria in the same way, so that they agreed on the preferences of the criteria. Thus, no aggregation was required for data at this stage. Then, we obtained matrix results and priority weights for evaluation criteria.

Next, in the DEMATEL stage, we sent by email also a questionnaire as an Excel worksheet for the three managers. Each decision-maker was asked to evaluate the direct influence of criterion “ci” on criterion “cj” using a linguistic scale. In order to aggregate the data from the three managers, the DEMATEL method was proposed to calculate the average matrix. Then, the sums of total effects and the net affect among all criteria are calculated.

Then, in the BN stage, we conducted first a meeting by video conference with the three managers in order to introduce the causal graph and the ordinal states (very low, low, medium, high and very high) that could be allocated for each criterion. These ranges were determined using feedback from three case company managers which were specific to their organization.

Then, decision-makers participated together a meeting and sent us by email data for case suppliers S1, S2 and S3, as a summary of their judgments regarding potential suppliers according to each criterion that was used as principal input in the BN model.

During the whole period, we also made intermediate online calls in order to present and discuss the results of each work package stage with the three decision-makers.

Then, the different steps of the proposed approach are explained through this case study.

# 3.1. Defining Sustainability Selection Criteria

This step is significant because a correctly identified set of criteria plays a vital role in supporting the decision-making process [6]. We define the criteria under economic (Eco), environmental (Env) and social dimensions (Soc) based on the literature review and the opinion of the decision-makers of the company. Thus, key decision criteria are investigated from a comprehensive literature review [5,9,15,25]. Then, these criteria are validated with decision-makers as an initial step in the sustainable supplier selection process. Criteria are defined as follows:

- Overall costs (Eco1): This is a key criterion for evaluating a supplier because it dictates the total supply chain cost. This criterion includes transportation and purchasing costs.
- Quality of product (Eco2): This is the capability of products and material to meet the quality standards for production processes. Scrap rate is used to determine the quality of delivered parts in this study.
- Quality of service (Eco3): This criterion represents the ability of a partner to satisfy demand and perform various functions in terms of delivery.
- Reducing pollution (Env1): The total emitted CO2 by each supplier is used to determine their performance regarding reducing pollution.
- Resource consumption (Env2): Suppliers are evaluated regarding the amount of energy consumption. Building energy performance indicator in kwh/m2/year is used.
- Environmental management system (Env3): The level of effort to reduce environmental impact is measured by an environmental management system certification (ISO 14001) (https://nbs.net/p/3-ways-smes-can-tackle-iso-14001-70c12e6b-8c15-428b-9c15-c248f08cf098). ISO 14001 has a progressive approach that breaks down the certification process into three successive levels.
- Employment practices (Soc1): This critical criterion defines the total commitment of a potential partner regarding employment. It refers to the level of temporary workers in this study.
- Health and safety (Soc2): Partners in the sustainable supply chain should aim to improve activities by minimizing health and safety incidents and implementing security practices to enhance the quality of life for employees. Number of incidents per year per 1000 employees is considered to evaluate the supplier.
- Responsibility to stakeholders and community (Soc3): Funds given by a supplier for educational, charitable purposes and to support community projects and social programs could be considered when evaluating suppliers in terms of social responsibility.

# 3.2.1. AHP for Sustainability Dimension Weights and Hierarchical Structure

AHP is one of the most popular MCDM methods. One study found that the technique is used as a standalone approach in around 19% of supplier selection studies [33]. The basic concept of AHP is to cluster the data into smaller groups and, using pairwise comparison, weight elements at each level.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

It measures the decision-maker’s preference for one criterion over another by assigning a numerical value to the preference levels [34]. AHP is used to initially construct the BN model as a hierarchical structure. AHP assumes that criteria, at the same level of a hierarchy, are independent. In this study, the AHP for estimating the weights of selected criteria are summarized as follows:

# Step 1: Modeling the sustainable supplier selection problem as a hierarchical structure.

We model the supplier selection problem as a hierarchical structure including a goal to evaluate the supplier at the first level, sustainable dimensions at the second level and criteria at the third level. Nine criteria, summarized in Section 3.1, are assumed to be the most relevant sustainability criteria; this set is suggested by firm decision-makers and has been incorporated into this study.

# Step 2: Constructing the judgment matrices.

We construct the judgment matrices (CMs) for each level via pairwise comparisons with respect to the goal of selecting a sustainable supplier. The decision-maker (DM) preferences are based on comparing pairs of factors and are represented using a linguistic scale (equal importance = 1, somewhat important = 3, strongly more important = 5, very strongly more important = 7, extremely more important = 9, intermediate values = 2,4,6,8). A reciprocal value depending on the direction of preferences between pairs of factors populates the remaining portions of the matrix.

# Step 3: Computing the vector of criteria weights.

A pairwise comparison is a n × n real matrix where n is the number of criteria. Each entry αjk represents the preference weight of the jth criterion relative to the kth criterion. If αjk > 1, the jth criterion is more important than the kth criterion and vice versa. αjk and αk j follow the constraint:

αjk × αk j = 1 (1)

A normalized pairwise comparison matrix norm is derived from CM. Each entry αjk is computed as:

αjk = ∑l=1n αjkαlk (2)

An “n” dimensional column vector, the criteria weight vector ω, is built by averaging each αjk:

ωj = ∑l=1n αjlln (3)

The calculation is completed using MATLAB software. The consistency is evaluated using the consistency ratio (CR) suggested by [34].

By applying AHP to the case study, the relative importance of each pair of elements is prioritized using input from three case company decision-makers as experts. These managers include a purchasing manager (DM1), a logistics manager (DM2) and a supply chain director (DM3). They jointly completed a questionnaire of the possible pairwise comparisons. The comparison matrices (CMs) are constructed along the sustainability dimensions and sustainability criteria levels.

# Table 2. Matrix results for criteria level.

|Economic Criteria (ECO)|Eco1|Eco2|Eco3| | | | | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | |Env1|Env2|Env3| | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | |Soc1|Soc2|Soc3| | | | | | | |
| |1|1/3|5|1|5|3|1|1/5|1/3| | | | | |
| |3|1|3| | |1/5|1|3|5|1|5| | | |
| | | | | | |1/5|1/3|1|1/3|1/3|1|3|1/5|1|

Some revisions of judgment with the decision-makers (DMs) were necessary as some matrix consistency ratios exceeded 0.1. By applying AHP steps and using MATLAB software, the importance

weights of dimensions (Weco, Wenv, Wsoc) are (0.618, 0.297, 0.086), respectively, with a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.07 (see Table 3). The economic factor is the most significant dimension in selecting a supplier for the DMs, with the highest value of priority weights W = 0.618.

# Table 3. Priority weights of evaluation criteria using the AHP method.

|Dimensions|Weights|Criteria|Total Weights|Consistency|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ECO (0.618)| |Eco1|0.350|CR = 0.090|
| | |Eco2|0.067| |
| | |Eco3|0.199| |
|ENV (0.297)| |Env1|0.193|CR = 0.086|
| | |Env2|0.038| |
| | |Env3|0.066| |
|SOC (0.086)| |Soc1|0.008|CR = 0.078|
| | |Soc2|0.017| |
| | |Soc3|0.060| |

Under the economic dimension, “Eco1: cost” is the most important criterion, with a total relative weight of 0.350. “Env1: reducing pollution” is the most important criterion under the environmental dimension, with a total weight of 0.193. Consequently, suppliers should focus on pollution reduction to help maintain an advantage over competing suppliers. “Soc3: responsibility to stakeholders and community” is the most significant criterion for supplier social consideration. The summary weights of the various dimensions and criteria presented in Table 3 are used as inputs in the BN model.

# 3.2.2. DEMATEL for Direct Relations and Causal Graph

The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is a tool determining importance and causal relationships amongst various evaluation criteria [35]. This method may confirm interdependence among variables. DEMATEL results in grouping factors into “cause” and “effect” categories between factors. DEMATEL is used to build the initial BN causal graph using the final direct relationship matrix [24]. The various steps of DEMATEL are outlined as follows:

Step 1: Constructing the initial relationship matrices.

Assume there are n identified evaluation criteria for supplier selection made by m decision-makers. Each decision-maker is asked to evaluate the direct influence of criterion ci on criterion c. This influencej is assigned an integer linguistic scale value including 0 (no influence), 1 (low influence), 2 (medium influence), 3 (high influence) and 4 (very high influence). X1, X2, X3, . . . , Xm form an initial relation matrix, Xk = [xijk], where k is the decision-maker participating in the evaluation process (1 ≤ k ≤ m).

Step 2: Calculating the average matrix.

To aggregate all judgments from m decision-makers, the average matrix A = [aij] is calculated using expression (4):

A = [aij] = 1/m ∑xijm k

Obtaining the normalized initial direct relation matrix.

The normalized initial direct relation matrix R = [rij], where rij (0, 1) can be obtained using expression (5).

R = λ ∗ A

λ = Min(max∑n=1|aij|,1≤j≤n∑n=1|aij|)

factors. The value maxn∑nThe value maxn∑nj=1∣∣∣aij∣∣∣ indicates the value of the factor with the maximum direct effect on other 1≤i≤ i=1∣∣∣aij∣∣∣ is the factor which is most affected by other factors. A positive scalar matrix λ is the upper bound and allocates the lowest value of these two to itself. The matrix R is obtained by dividing each element of matrix A by a scalar value λ. Each rij element from matrix R is a value between zero and one.

# Step 3: Calculating the total relation matrix.

A continuous decrease in the indirect effects of problems along the powers of matrix R, e.g., R2, R3 . . . ., R∞, guarantees convergent solutions to the matrix inversion, similar to an absorbing Markov chain matrix. The full influence matrix F = [fij], where fij represents the full direct and indirect influence exerted by criterion ci on criterion c, can be determined using expression (6):

F = R(1 − R)−1 (6)

where I is the identity matrix.

# Step 4: Calculating the total cause and effect including joint direct and indirect effects.

Each row sum and column sum of matrix T is calculated using expressions (7) and (8), respectively:

q = [qi]n×1 = [∑j=1n Fij] (7)

P = [pj]n×1 = [∑i=1n Fij] (8)

The value qi indicates the total direct and indirect effects which criterion i has on other criteria. The value of pj indicates the direct and indirect effects of all other criteria on criterion j. Thus, when j = i, the sum (qi + p) yields an index representing the total effects on and by criterion i. In other words, (qi + p) represents the prominence (degree of importance) that criterion i has in the system of criteria. The difference (qi − p) indicates the net effect that criterion ci has on the system. When (qi − p) is positive, criterion ci is a net causer, and when (qi − p) is negative, criterion i is a net receiver.

# Step 5: Producing causal and effect diagram.

The threshold value μ is computed by averaging the elements in matrix F in order to eliminate some minor effect relationships amongst factors in matrix F (see expression (9)):

μ = [∑i=1n ∑j=1n Fij] (9)

where L is the total number of elements in the matrix F. The values of elements in matrix F are set to zero if their values are less than μ. That is, no influence is assumed with other criteria when values are less than μ. Finally, the network relationship map is determined by mapping the dataset of (q + p, q − p), where the horizontal axis (q + p) is made by adding q to p, and the vertical axis (q − p) is made by subtracting q from p.

We apply these steps to the case study. Xk represents the data gathered from the three decision-makers. The average matrix Aeco for economic criteria was established by using Equation (4).

Aeco = [0 0.667 1]

The normalized initial direct relation matrix Reco was calculated using Equation (5):

0.50       0        0

The total relation matrix Feco is used for constructing a causal graph for a BN. The threshold value μ = 0.219 is defined. The values that were greater than μ = 0.219 represent the direct relation links between criteria. For example, the value of REco21 (0.571) > μ (0.219), the arrow in the causal map, is drawn from Eco2 to Eco1. Eco3 directly influences Eco1 as Reco31 (0.571) > μ (0.219). The total relation matrix Feco was calculated using Equation (3).

Feco =
                               

                               
0.571     0.057     0.085

The sums of rows and columns of matrix Feco were calculated by using Equations (7) and (8) as summarized in Table 4.

# Table 4. The sums of total effects and the net affect among economic criteria.

| |Eco1|Eco2|Eco3|q|p|q + p|q − p|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Eco1|0.143|0.114|0.171|0.484|1.286|1.714|−0.857|
|Eco2|0.571|0.057|0.085|0.714|0.228|0.943|0.486|
|Eco3|0.571|0.057|0.086|0.714|0.343|1.057|0.371|

The importance of economic criteria is determined using the prominence index representing the total effects both directed to and from each criterion. Cost (Eco1) is the most prominent (important) evaluation criterion with the largest (q + p) value = 1.714, whereas quality of product (Eco2) is the least important criterion with the smallest (q + p) value = 0.943. From the (q + p) values, the criteria prioritization is Eco1 > Eco3 > Eco2, confirming the AHP results.

Using the net effect (q − p) values, the criteria are divided into cause groups with positive (q − p) values and effect groups with negative (q − p) values. In this study, the Eco3 and Eco2 are considered as net cause, having the (q − p) values of 0.486 and 0.371, respectively. In the effect group, cost (Eco1) is classified as a net receiver, with a (q − p) value of −0.857.

The same process is repeated in order to obtain the cause and effect relationships among the environmental and social criteria as shown in Tables 5 and 6.

# 3.3. Defining the States and Parametrizing the Bayesian Network Model

BNs are network probabilistic models based on Bayes’ theorem and can be utilized for decision support. Bayes’ theorem considers prior probabilities about events and develops predictions based on new information. The fundamental property of BN can be simply explained as follows [36]: realized, ∑j=1n = 1, 2..n, i , j. The event I is observed, which can occur only under the condition that a set of disjunctive events is considered S = {S1, S2,..., Sn}, where one of them is (Sj)

P = 1. The occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of others Sj ∩ Si = ∅, i, j some of the events S, j = 1, 2,.., n have already occurred. Then, the conditional probability of event Sr,j given that the event I has already been realized, is calculated using expression (10):

P(Sr/I) = P(Sr)P(I/Sr)P(I) = ∑j=1nP(Sr)P(I/Sj) (I/Sr) (10)

where P(S) is the probability of event S, i.e., the starting or an a priori probability. P(I) is the probability of event I. P(I/S) is the probability of event I, given that event Sj has occurred (conditional probability). P(S/I) is the probability of an event Sj given that event I has occurred (revised or a posteriori probability).

A BN begins with a graphical structure which is composed of nodes and arcs. Nodes represent events and arcs represent direct causal relationships between events. If there is an arc from event A to B, this means that event A is a parent of event B, and event B is a child of event A. The causal relationship between events can be described in terms of conditional probabilities. A BN structure can be constructed using expert knowledge. This construction is not trivial, especially when multiple decision-makers are used. However, a generally accepted method to build BN structures with decision-makers does not exist.

BNs are able of handling qualitative (poor/fair/good), Boolean (yes/no) or quantitative variables. Data representing these events are called states and may be derived from historical data, expertise or a combination of the two. The parameters of a BN are encoded in node probability tables (NPT). Each node has an associated NPT that defines the conditional probability distribution of that node conditioned on its parents.

After defining the states for each criterion, the BN parameters are determined using a ranked nodes method.

There are two types of variables used in the proposed BN model:

Qualitative variables have ranked responses with five ordinal states including very low, low, medium, high and very high for dimensions and criteria levels. These variables are represented by a ranked nodes method that reduces the number of parameters needed for each variable and simplifies the definition of NPTs for decision-makers. Ranked nodes assume a truncated normal (TNormal) distribution with a central tendency towards the probability of parent nodes due to a weighted function [24]. In this study, a weighted average (wmean) function for the ranked nodes is used. This function requires a coefficient and a variance parameter for every parent variable. These parameters are defined using AHP results for sustainable dimension nodes. The DEMATEL results are used for the criteria nodes.

Boolean variables have binary responses with true or false states. These variables are represented in the supplier selection node. For example, if (parents > 0.6, “True”, “False”), meaning “if the sum of the parent values is greater than 0.6 then the value is ‘True’; otherwise, it is ‘False’”.

Five ordinal states (very low, low, medium, high and very high) are introduced for each criterion. These ranges are determined using feedback from three case company managers which are specific to their organization. The specific ranges for variable states for each criterion are summarized in Tables 7–9.

# Table 7. Economic criteria states and ranges.

|State|Eco1 (Cost)|Eco2 (Scrap Rate)|Eco3 (Delivery on Time)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Very low|&gt;200$|&gt;10%|97%|

Ranked nodes are used to parametrize the sustainable aspects and criteria nodes with weighted average (wmean) function in the case study. For the “wmean” function, we need to define a coefficient for each variable and a variance parameter.

For example, in the broader sustainability dimensions level of BN, the parents of the node “economic dimension” (Eco) are (Eco1, Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values obtained by AHP as shown in Table 3.

The variance values for the ranked nodes were defined by the variance of the DEMATEL responses for the economic dimension (ECO). For example, when we asked the decision-makers (DM1), (DM2), (DM3) to answer the question “How much does cost (Eco1) influence the economic dimension (Eco)?”, they answered in different ways using the linguistic scale values (1 low, 2 medium, 3 high), respectively. Then, we calculate the variance of these answers by taking the difference between the largest and smallest valued responses, as shown in Table 10.

**Table 10. Means and variances of effects of Eco1, Eco2 and Eco3 on Eco.**
|Parameters|How Much Does Cost (Eco1) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|How Much Does Quality of Product (Eco2) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|How Much Does Quality of Service (Eco) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Mean|0.350|0.067|0.199|
|Variance|0.01|0.01|0.01|

At the criteria level, the weights of each parent were defined based on their coefficients in the average direct relation matrix obtained from DEMATEL. For example, the parents of cost (Eco1) are (Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values in matrix Aeco. The variance values for the ranked nodes were defined by the sum of variances of the DEMATEL questionnaire responses for Eco1 in Table 11.

**Table 11. Means and variances of effects of Eco2, Eco3 on Eco1.**
|Parameters|How Much Does (Eco2) Influence (Eco1)?|How Much Does (Eco3) Influence Cost (Eco1)?|
|---|---|---|
|Mean|3.33|3.33|
|Variance|0.333|0.333|

The overall final target node is the supplier selection variable. This node provides a probability statement about whether the supplier should be selected, conditioned on environmental, social and economic nodes and considering their weights.

The supplier selection node is defined by a Boolean variable for which a probability measures whether a criterion is met (True) or not (False). The Boolean expression is (0.618 * Eco + 0.297 * Env + 0.086 * Soc > 0.6, “True”, “False”) based on the importance given to these criteria by the decision-makers according to the AHP results (Table 3). This means that the global performance of the supplier should be at least 60% but can be determined by the company. The value of 60% was determined according to the decision-makers and it can be unique according to specific company requirements.

After the parameters of all nodes are determined, the initial BN model is evaluated using “AgenaRisk” software as shown in Figure 3. In this initial BN, the decision regarding the selection of the supplier is approximately 71% false and 29% true. This means that if this supplier is selected, there is only a 29% probability that they will actually be the best overall performer.

# 3.4. Completing a Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis provides evidence for the robustness of the solution. The objective is to verify how much each criterion is affected by the variation in the other criteria or parameters. This may also help to determine the most influential criteria. Sensitivity analysis was proposed using a tornado graph.

The length of the bars in the tornado graphs can be considered as the measure of the impact of sensitivity variables on the target variable and the sensitivity of this variable on other variables.

For example, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the supplier evaluation node with respect to economic, environmental and social aspects. The probability of supplier selection being true and false is 29% and 71%, respectively, as illustrated in the tornado graphs in Figures 4 and 5. From these figures, we see that the probability of selecting a supplier is more sensitive to the changes in the value of the economic dimension and least sensitive to changes in social dimension values. We also carried out the sensitivity analysis regarding the criteria. For example, if the overall Eco dimension is “Very High”, given that the criteria parents remain equal, then the probability of selection of this supplier is 93.3%, meeting the performance expectations. In Figure 5, we see that if Eco = very low, then it is 100% likely not to be selected (this is also true in Figure 4, which shows a 0.000 probability of supplier selection = True when Eco = very low).

What-if scenario analyses (predictive analyses) are also conducted to evaluate the inferences of the model based on decision-maker knowledge. Such analyses can be performed by entering a number of observations into the BN to update the marginal probabilities of any unobserved variables. The objective is to examine how the posterior probabilities of the supplier selection criteria change when different evidence is entered into the model. For instance, we tested the impact of unknown information of some criteria on the decision for selecting a supplier. In scenario 1, we assumed information that there was a very high level for “health and safety (Soc2)” in the social dimension, very high level for “quality of product (Eco2)” in the economic dimension and with no information in the environmental dimension.

We can see that by increasing the health and safety (Soc2) result, considerable improvement is seen in social criteria employment practices (Soc1) from 20% to 82% (very high) and responsibility to stakeholders and community (Soc3) from 20% to 90% (very high). Considerable improvement is seen also in cost (Eco1) from 8.2% to 30% (very high) as a result of increasing product quality (Eco2) from 20% to 100% as shown in Figure 6. The overall decision for selecting this supplier is now 55.69% true; previously, this result in the base case was 29.3% true.

|Supplier selection|False|True|
|---|---|---|
|Soc|44.306%|55.694%|
|Env|Very Low|20.292%|
|Low|11.4045| |

In scenario 2, as shown in Figure 7, we include the new environmental performance of the supplier. Assume that a high level of performance for (Env1) occurred, meaning that the supplier produced a very...

small quantity of total emitted CO2, possibly through improved supply and transport activities. Based on this information, our model predicts a high level in the environmental dimension. The decision about selecting this supplier now increases to approximately 71% true.

Figure 7. Scenario 2: very high health and safety (Soc2) and quality of product (Eco2) and high reduction in pollution (Env1).

In scenario 3, presented in Figure 8, we have information only about the quality of service (Eco3) as a low level in the economic aspect and a high level of resource consumption (Env2) in the environmental aspect, and no social criteria information is provided. Based on this information, the probability of the economic performance being low is 41.049%. Thus, the decision about selecting this supplier is 82.245% false due to the very high importance of the economic dimension.

# Supplier selection

|Very High|High -|19.717%|

Figure 8. Scenario 3: low quality of service (Eco3) and high resource consumption (Env2).

In summary, the proposed model enables the decision-makers to conduct a wide variety of scenario analyses with incomplete information. The information about supplier criteria can be conflicting, and the analyses could be revised when more information becomes available. Thus, the proposed BN are validated by decision-makers according to this sensitivity analysis.

# 3.5. Applying the Proposed Bayesian Network Model

In this case study, three alternative suppliers (S1, S2, S3) for a component to be purchased by the company are evaluated by the decision-makers. The manufacturer worked with supplier S1 and S2 before and they have some information from past experience. S3 is a new potential supplier with limited information from previous experience.

The offered component price by supplier S3 is USD 120. Thus, supplier S3 was assigned a medium level for criterion Eco1. The company asked S3 to send sample parts, the supplier delivered the parts on time, Eco2, and had a rejection rate &lt; 1%. Eco3 is considered “high” in this case. For S3 environmental performance, the managers do not know the total emitted CO2 (Env1) or the energy performance indicator (Env2) of supplier S3. This supplier has implemented an environmental management system in order to obtain an environmental certification (Env3). For the social dimension, this supplier did not provide any information about employment practices (Soc1) or about the number of incidents (Soc2). They indicated a social responsibility budget (Soc3) as 7% of sales.

The managers have no information about the total carbon emissions (Env2) caused by supplier S2 activities. There is also no information about energy consumption (Env2). A summary of this and other case information from suppliers S1, S2, S3 is presented in Table 12.

**Table 12. Data for case Suppliers S1, S2 and S3.**
|Criteria|S1|S2|S3|
|---|---|---|---|
|Eco1|High|Medium|Medium|
|Eco2|High|High|High|
|Eco3|High|High|Very high|

|Env2|Medium|No information|No information|
|Env3|High|No information|High|
|Soc1|High|High|No information|
|Soc2|Low|Medium|No information|
|Soc3|Medium|Medium|High|

We entered the values from Table 12 into the BN model results for suppliers S1, S2, S3. The results are illustrated in Figure 9.

Figure 9. BN model for suppliers S1, S2 and S3.

# 4. Results Analysis and Managerial Implications

Based on sustainable criteria evaluation using AHP, the economic factor is the most significant dimension in selecting a supplier with the highest value of priority weights W = 0.618 for DMs. This helps DMs to understand the current state of practice in sustainable supplier selection in the company and to review and update their priorities regarding sustainability criteria.

On the other hand, after sharing the priorities with partners, they will pay more attention regarding the criteria which are more important for the DMs. For instance, for supplier S1, the social responsibility budget (Soc3) is only 2% of sales and this criterion is the most important criterion under the social aspect for DMs in the evaluation of the supplier. Thus, supplier S1 should increase this percentage of Soc3 to be better evaluated.

For DMs, the lack of certain information concerning the performance of the supplies should not prevent the possibility of an adequate evaluation. The proposed BN model allowed decision-makers to evaluate the global performance of each supplier despite the missing information regarding one criterion for supplier S1, two criteria for S2 and four criteria for supplier S3.

Thus, based on the evidence from past experience of supplier S1, the BN model predicts medium performance (approximately 52.76%) or high performance (approximately 47.24%) of reducing pollution quantity (Env1) due to the existence of a highly ranked environmental management system (Env3). Thus, selecting S1 as a partner is approximately 75% true. This result confirms the opinions of the decision-makers.

For supplier S2, the model predicts high-level performance for energy consumption (Env2), with a probability of 78.07% and also high-level performance for environmental management system criterion (Env3) with a probability of 76.68% as it demonstrates high performance in reducing pollution criterion (Env1). Its global economic performance (Eco) is predicted to be 50.31%, a medium level, which should be improved as this criterion is the most important for DMs in this case. The final decision about selecting supplier S2 is 58.2% true and 41.7% false. Therefore, supplier S2 should improve some areas of performance in order to satisfy the requirement level as a sustainable supplier. The result reinforces the decision-maker’s opinion about supplier S2. The company knew that S2 was not performing exceptionally well but did not know at which level and where S2 could improve. This model was useful in identifying some means of improving S2’s performance, allowing the company to strengthen collaboration by aiding in supplier development.

Using the incomplete information that decision-makers have about supplier S3, its environmental and social performance is likely to be high with probability (68.69%, 75.22%), respectively. Moreover, despite the high uncertainty due to the lack of information regarding the environmental criteria (Env1) and (Env2), social criteria (Soc1) and (Soc2), selecting S3 is approximately 76.4% true. This result is due to the high-level probability forecast of 58.91% in its global economic performance. The decision-makers believe that they can establish a partnership with this company.

Mathematically complex approaches are often not easily understood and useable by decision-makers. Here, the methodology feedback from the managerial decision-makers was very positive. They find the model easy to use and helpful in evaluating suppliers. Causal expert-driven BNs are usually complex. By combining AHP, DEMATEL and BNs, we simplify the building of the model while developing some methodological consistency. Using different types of events including Boolean and qualitative make the model flexible. Further, different sources of data ranging from historical to actual evidence were valuable as well and could be effectively integrated overall into the BN model. Furthering transparency and replicability in a clear rigorous process builds the legitimacy of the model. The graphical nature of the BN results makes the technique more accessible to management, furthering managerial acceptance. The clarity and legitimacy are important when seeking the adoption of decision tools and models in organizations.

The proposed model is based on theoretical aspects and dimensions supported by organizational needs and requirements. Additionally, the results could have been varied in as required by the organizational decision-makers to further validate their specific “what-if” scenarios. The approach

# 5.1. Summary of Findings and Contributions

Evaluating and selecting suppliers according to the triple bottom line (TBL) approach can reinforce sustainable performance in supply networks. In practical situations, this task is a complicated multi-criteria decision-making problem and time-consuming assignment. This decision is generally imprecise and uncertain, with limited and unknown information. This study provides a global picture for sustainable supplier selection problems and proposes a decision-making tool using a combined, harmonized, AHP-DEMATEL-BN method. The decision environment provided some uncertainty for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers. The proposed approach could easily convert decision-maker knowledge and preferences into meaningful results. An actual case example for the sustainable supplier selection problem in a manufacturing company provided some managerial and research insights.

This research contributes to the field of sustainable supplier selection by incorporating judgment with actual data. Historical and unknown information were also integrated into the evaluation. These are real situations, which no one model can capture.

Based on AHP, DMs were able to evaluate sustainable criteria and to understand their current priorities in the supplier evaluation process. Using DEMATEL, the interactions among evaluation criteria with selection purposes were also clearly identified. The BN model allowed decision-makers to incorporate incomplete information and missing data. Thus, despite the high uncertainty due to the lack of information concerning the evaluation of certain suppliers, DMs were able to evaluate them in a clear, rigorous process.

Thus, the obtained results offer guidelines for analysts and decision-makers in order to understand the current issues related to the sustainable supplier selection process. These results can also help decision-makers to control evaluation criteria and to improve the relationships with their selected suppliers. This research demonstrated some of the advantages and disadvantages of each method. It was shown that AHP, DEMATEL and BN were good, complementary approaches.

# 5.2. Limitations

However, the approach has some limitations. We only focused on a small set of potential criteria for supplier evaluation and selection. In some cases, dozens of factors can be considered. In this situation, the decision environment becomes more complex. For instance, using AHP with more than nine evaluation criteria at the same level of hierarchy requires grouping some of them into an overall criterion and creating sub-criteria. Some filtering to key performance indicators (KPI) may be required for the methodology to remain tractable. As we have mentioned, one of the important characteristics of any model, its usefulness and acceptance, is dependent on how well managers understand the whole process. In this case, although some of the AHP analysis may be intuitive, the BN required greater explanation. Moreover, the use of the hydride approach based on AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods seems quite complicated for decision-makers in companies while selecting the supplier. Alternatively, the rigor provides an avenue for analysts to convince managers of the scientific propensity of the technique, further justifying decisions.

# 5.3. Future Research Directions

Although we believe that our study can provide a new framework and a decision-making tool for selecting and evaluating suppliers in the sustainable supply chain, our research work could be expanded and improved in future research. Some future directions are identified as follows:

- This study was more methodologically oriented as the research showed how the methodology can integrate various complex issues in managerial decision-making. As the problem size increases, the applicability and accuracy of the model will require further investigation. For example, what if the number of factors increases regarding the number of alternatives or criteria?
- A complete validation of the study will be undertaken by considering more scenarios. Experimenting with the methodology would be worthwhile to determine if all scenarios are supportive. For example, what if all the data were known, or only known data were utilized? What if none of the data were known and it was a completely new product with new suppliers? How well can the model learn? These are all questions that may be asked in various experimental scenarios or in long-term longitudinal studies.
- It will be also useful to expand the BN model with indicators for some criteria and to consider the decision-maker characteristics; for example, would supply chain managers differ from engineering or marketing managers?
- Furthermore, the proposed model can be solved by using other approaches and the obtained results can be compared with each other using the Spearman rank correlation method, such as multiple criteria tools including ANP, TOPSIS and PROMETHEE, to name a few. Otherwise, different methods can be compared regarding the time, the complexity and the restriction on the number of alternatives or criteria used in the selection process in order to identify which method is more robust.
- Additionally, this study can be extended to other domains for evaluation and selection decision-making problems. The update of the evaluation criteria according to each specific case will be necessary.

Finally, we sought to integrate a series of tools and found the technique useful and feasible. Thus, we continue to build on the important supplier selection field and knowledge.

# Abstract

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art machine learning model capable of generating human-like text through natural language processing (NLP). The age of generative Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing business operations in organizations by augmenting and automating processes. This necessitates a rethinking of Business Process Management (BPM) as businesses strive to understand the behaviour of their information systems, and services. The proliferation of tools for analyzing process executions, system interactions, and system dependencies is evidence of this priority in medium and large enterprises [1], [2]. With the advent of generative AI, businesses can use AI augmentation to enhance their processes flows and make decisions based on context and user input.

The model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process generation using generative AI is changing many processes, improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows.

# A. Generative Pre-trained Transformer

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art language model that utilizes deep neural networks to generate human-like text. The model was first introduced by OpenAI2 in 2018 and has since been updated with larger and more complex versions. GPT’s success in generating coherent and high-quality text has led to the development of other generative models that employ similar techniques. Examples include:

- Text Generation: ChatGPT3 developed by OpenAI;
- Image Generation: DALL-E4 developed by OpenAI;
- Speech Generation: VALL-E5 developed by Microsoft;
- Code Generation: GitHub Copilot6 developed by GitHub7 and OpenAI.

The potential of generative AI extends beyond just generating new data, as it has the capability to revolutionise the processes in organizations and personal life by offering process augmentation, automation, and improvement. Generative AI has numerous applications, including the automation of content creation tasks such as writing articles, creating social media posts, and generating product descriptions. Additionally, it can be used to identify patterns and anomalies in financial transactions, help to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, or automatically inspect and evaluate the quality of products, reducing the need for manual inspection. Another benefit of generative AI is that it can automate customer service tasks, such as answering common queries and handling routine tasks, allowing human agents to focus on more complex issues.

# B. Business Process Management

Business Process Management (BPM) refers to the discipline of managing, modelling, analyzing, and improving business processes within an organization[1], [5]. Business processes are central to the operation of public and private enterprises. They involve activities that transform inputs into outputs, delivering value to customers and stakeholders. The success of an enterprise depends on how efficiently and effectively its processes are executed. For this reason, business process analytics has always been a key endeavour for companies[1], [6]. Early efforts to address this goal started with process automation, where workflow and other middleware technologies were used to reduce human involvement through better systems integration and automated execution of business logic. The total or partial automation of the process creates an unprecedented opportunity to gain visibility on process executions in the enterprise.

In addition to the techniques, frameworks, and methodologies mentioned for business process management, there is an increasing need to support knowledge workers in ad-hoc processes[7]. These workers require technologies such as GPT to help them offer new processes by maintaining process models in process silos using generative AI-enabled approaches. This is particularly important in scenarios where it is challenging for the knowledge worker to choose the best next step. With the help of these technologies, the focus of process thinking has expanded to include the creation and maintenance of process models that can adapt to changing business needs and support decision-making in real time. These advancements have further increased the importance of analyzing business process-related data to discover helpful information and achieve business objectives.

In our previous work[7], we introduced the design of AI-enabled business processes. A recent approach, Process-GAN[8], has been proposed to employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) for business process improvement (BPI). This approach assists process designers in creating innovative BPI concepts. Another approach, proposed by Mustansir et al.[9], used an NLP-based approach to extract redesign suggestions for automatic business process redesign.

# C. Data-centric Processes

Analyzing process-related data is crucial in data-centric processes, which are gaining importance in medium and large enterprises. This data analysis helps enterprises to identify business needs, determine solutions to problems, and make informed decisions. Process data analytics has seen significant advancements in recent years, with research focusing on linking the insights gained from process data analytics to the process analysis phase. By analyzing data from various sources such as enterprise systems, sensor data, and social media, companies can gain insights into their processes and improve them for better performance. Examples of data-centric processes include supply chain management, fraud detection, and customer experience optimization. These practices and technologies provide process analytics from querying to analyzing process data, thus covering a broad spectrum of business process paradigms.

# D. Knowledge-Intensive Processes

Knowledge-intensive processes encompass operations that critically depend on the expertise of subject-matter experts, whose cognitive capabilities have been shaped by the acquisition and accumulation of knowledge and experience within their biological neural networks[10]. This source of knowledge can be used as the core of AI-enabled Processes, for example, to facilitate understanding the intentions of end-users better or providing a comprehensive method to retrieve useful information from the enterprise platform. In our previous work[11], we proposed the use of crowdsourcing services for mimicking the knowledge of domain experts in knowledge-intensive processes, and use this knowledge to build a new type of Knowledge Bases (namely Knowledge Base 4.0) that can facilitate the auto labelling of the data to be used in learning algorithms. The goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing from domain experts using rule-based crowdsourcing services.

In this paper, we take a step forward in introducing the concept of ProcessGPT. This model is specifically designed

to cater to data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. It achieves this by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a vast amount of business process data and models. This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can also be integrated with natural language processing and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can be used to automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency, while also enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT has the potential to revolutionize business process management by offering a powerful tool for process automation, improvement, and decision-making.

# II. PROCESS GPT: FROM AUGMENTATION TO AUTOMATION

The proposed architecture for ProcessGPT is depicted in Figure 1, which comprises several essential components such as the Process Data space, Process Data Lake, Process Knowledge Lake, Process Knowledge, Process Knowledge Graph, Transformer Model, and the Process Co-pilot.

The Process Data Space layer refers to all process-related data that is generated across multiple data islands, including process logs, process model silos, best practices, and process-related data that is generated across various data islands such as open, private, and social data. This data exhibits typical properties of big data, including wide physical distribution, diversity of formats, nonstandard data models, and independently managed and heterogeneous semantics. To manage this large and diverse process-related data, the Process Data Lake layer is proposed. This layer leverages our previous work, Data Lake as a Service [12], to organize, index, and query the big process data and metadata. The Process Data Lake layer will facilitate the effective organization of the process-related data and metadata to enable efficient retrieval, analysis, and sharing of knowledge across various data islands.

After storing the raw data in the Process Data Lake, the next step is to transform this data into contextualized data and knowledge. This transformation is achieved using the Knowledge Lake as a Service approach, which has been developed in previous work [13]. To facilitate this transformation, the proposed approach involves the creation of a Process Knowledge Lake layer, which utilizes curation services to clean, integrate, and transform the raw data. Additionally, value is added to this data through the extraction, enrichment, and linking of information items. The contextualized data is pre-processed in the Knowledge Lake to form a large graph known as the Process Knowledge Graph. This graph is a representation of the relationships between the various entities in the process-related data, providing a more complete and holistic view of the process knowledge. The Process Knowledge Graph serves as a foundation for subsequent analyses, enabling effective decision-making and process improvement.

The Process Knowledge Graph is a large, semantically rich graph database that represents information and knowledge through a set of nodes and edges. The nodes in the graph represent entities or concepts, while the edges represent the relationships between these entities. The Process Knowledge Graph serves as a repository for contextualized process data, knowledge, tasks, and activities. The Knowledge Graph is a powerful tool for representing and organizing knowledge in a structured and interconnected manner. It enables the system to link related concepts and entities together, facilitating reasoning and inference across different domains. This interconnectedness between the various entities in the knowledge graph enables the system to reason about relationships and dependencies between different entities, enabling more effective decision-making and process improvement. The Knowledge Graph represents a significant advancement in process management and provides a foundation for developing intelligent and adaptive process management systems.

The Process Knowledge Graph does not include the best practices and knowledge of domain experts. To address this gap, our previous work [11] has been leveraged to mimic the knowledge of subject-matter experts using crowdsourcing services. This new knowledge is used to annotate the nodes and relationships in the Process Knowledge Graph, enhancing its completeness and accuracy. At this stage, the knowledge graph serves as a comprehensive source of data for the AI engine, specifically the ProcessGPT Transformer Model. The Transformer is a novel type of neural architecture that utilizes the attention mechanism to encode input data into robust features. ProcessGPT will use the Transformer-in-Transformer (TNT) [14] model that highlights the significance of attention within local patches for developing high-performing transformers. This model utilizes a similar approach to that used in generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), such as chatGPT and Github Co-pilot.

For example, chatGPT aims to suggest the best next keyword in the generated text. Github Co-pilot aims to suggest the best next line of code in the generated program. However, the goal of the ProcessGPT model is to suggest the best next step in the current process pipeline, leveraging the rich contextual information captured in the Process Knowledge Graph. In particular, integrating expert knowledge and the ProcessGPT Transformer Model enables more effective decision-making and process optimization, enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the process management system.

The architecture includes an essential component known as Process Co-pilot, which utilizes the latest advancements in Business Activity Monitoring [15]. The Process Co-pilot continuously monitors the activities in the current process instance, while simultaneously having access to the Knowledge Worker’s Persona and the Context Window, i.e., the number of previous tokens that are considered when generating the next token in the output sequence. It understands the Knowledge Worker’s objectives and requirements and sends a query to the Input Embeddings component, which is also fed by the Process Knowledge Graph. The Input Embeddings component

converts the input data into a series of vectors that can be processed by the ProcessGPT transformer model. This model provides the best next step in the processing pipeline, which is suggested to the Knowledge Worker while dealing with the case. This scenario is similar to Github Co-pilot, which suggests the best next code to a programmer in real-time while they are writing the program. The integration of the Process Co-pilot, Knowledge Worker Persona, Context Window, Input Embeddings component, and ProcessGPT transformer model facilitates more efficient and effective process management, enhancing the performance of the system. The utilization of state-of-the-art technologies and techniques ensures that the system can adapt to the evolving needs and requirements of the process management domain.

The Feedback loop is a crucial step in the architecture. In cases where the Knowledge Worker is not satisfied with the suggested best next step, the Process Co-pilot detects this and sends the feedback (e.g., useful or not useful) to the generative AI Services component. This provides the generative AI component with access to a rich source of information and focuses on maintaining the Process Knowledge Graph by identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the generated content and ensuring that the model continues to produce high-quality output. By incorporating this feedback loop, the generative AI Service can continuously improve its performance and better support the knowledge worker in their tasks.

# A. Process Augmentation

Generative AI has the potential to augment knowledge workers in knowledge-intensive processes and amplify their knowledge and skills to be more productive. One such example is the GitHub Copilot project, which uses generative AI to help software engineers write code more efficiently.

does this by analyzing the code that a programmer is working on and then suggesting the next line of code based on what it has learned from other code examples (developed by other developers). GitHub Copilot is based on the OpenAI Codex, a generative AI language model that has been trained on a large dataset of code. While GitHub Copilot is a great example of how generative AI can be used to augment knowledge workers in the software engineering domain, we believe that there is potential for similar technology in other data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes.

Our vision is to utilize ProcessGPT for the creation of domain-specific Co-pilots catering to knowledge workers operating in diverse domains such as health, banking, and education. Accordingly, this paper proposes the utilization of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology to develop new process models in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be a revolutionary technology for process management by offering powerful support for process automation, improvement, and decision-making. For example, in the healthcare domain, ProcessGPT can aid doctors in diagnosing patients more efficiently by analyzing patient data and suggesting the most likely diagnosis and treatment options. Similarly, in the banking domain, ProcessGPT can be used to suggest new process/data models to identify potential cases of fraud or money laundering by analyzing transaction data and suggesting suspicious transactions for further investigation. In education, as another example, ProcessGPT can assist teachers in understanding and analyzing students’ creativity patterns and offer new methods to help students who need help.

# B. Process Automation

The automation of business processes has become increasingly important in today’s fast-paced and competitive environment. Companies are looking for ways to improve their efficiency, reduce costs, and increase productivity. One promising approach is to use generative AI technology to automate business processes. ProcessGPT is designed to be a flexible and customizable tool that can be trained on large business process data and model datasets. The model can be fine-tuned on specific process domains, trained to generate process flows, and offer to automate structured and case-based business processes. By automating repetitive tasks and providing insights for process improvement, ProcessGPT can amplify the knowledge and skills of knowledge workers and enable them to focus on higher-level tasks. Furthermore, ProcessGPT can reduce errors and improve the quality of decision-making, leading to better outcomes for businesses and their customers.

# III. PROCESS GPT FOR MAINTAINING DATA ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES: AN AUGMENTATION SCENARIO

Consider a Bank as a large manufacturing company that relies heavily on its data ecosystem for its operations. The company has implemented various processes for data management, data analysis, and reporting. The processes involve several steps and can be quite complex. The company has hired a team of analysts to maintain these processes and ensure that they are running smoothly. One of the challenges that the analysts face is that the processes are constantly evolving, and they need to update the process models to reflect these changes. This can be a time-consuming and tedious task, as it involves analyzing large amounts of data and identifying the changes that need to be made.

To address this challenge, the bank has decided to implement ProcessGPT. The company trains a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data, including data from its own ecosystem and the subject-matter experts’ knowledge (captured in the Knowledge Base 4.0). The model learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data, which can be used to generate new process models. By using ProcessGPT, the bank is able to streamline its process maintenance tasks and reduce the time and effort required to update process models. This enables the analysts to focus on more strategic tasks and ensures that the company’s data ecosystem remains optimized for its operations.

# IV. PROCESS GPT FOR AUTOMATING EXAM MARKING: AN AUTOMATION SCENARIO

In the education sector, evaluating student performance and providing formative feedback is critical for improving students’ learning and achievements. However, grading exams and assignments can be time-consuming, particularly in large-scale online learning environments. One potential solution to reduce instructors’ workload is the use of ProcessGPT to automate exam marking. In our recent work [19], we leveraged generative AI to automate assessment marking in the education domain. The benefits of automating exam marking using ProcessGPT are manifold. Firstly, it can save time and resources for educators, allowing them to focus on other critical tasks such as analyzing student performance data and developing personalized learning plans. Secondly, it can eliminate human bias and ensure that all students are graded fairly and accurately. Thirdly, it can provide immediate feedback to students, allowing them to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance in future exams.

With the growing use of technology in education, automating exam marking using ProcessGPT is a logical step towards enhancing the learning process. Moreover, the use of ProcessGPT for exam marking has the potential to significantly improve the quality and reliability of assessments in the education sector. By training ProcessGPT algorithms on a large dataset of previously graded exams, the system can learn how to identify and evaluate specific patterns in the answers, learn from instructors’ experience, and accurately and consistently grade exams with much faster turnaround times than human graders. Moreover, the use of ProcessGPT for exam marking can also detect plagiarism. By analyzing and comparing the answers provided by students in the same exam and previous exams, ProcessGPT algorithms can identify similarities that may indicate plagiarism. This is especially useful for large classes where it may be difficult for human graders to detect such cases. Furthermore, ProcessGPT can

# also detect subtle differences in writing styles, making it more difﬁcult for students to evade detection. This will ensure academic integrity and discourage cheating, providing a fairer and more transparent evaluation of student performance.

# V. PROCESS GPT FOR WORKFLOWS: A HYBRID SCENARIO FOR BLENDING AUTOMATION AND AUGMENTATION

In the age of generative AI, the landscape of workﬂows is undergoing a signiﬁcant transformation. The emergence of advanced AI models, such as ProcessGPT, can revolutionise how we perceive, design, and utilize workﬂows. ProcessGPT paves the way for a transformative approach that seamlessly integrates automation and augmentation, redeﬁning the workﬂows of the future. This in turn has the potential to revolutionize how tasks are accomplished, offering a hybrid model that combines the efﬁciency of automation with the expertise of human knowledge workers. Let us explore a motivating scenario in a police investigation where ProcessGPT showcases its capabilities in supporting a hybrid mode. Law enforcement agencies operate within a complex web of processes, from evidence collection and suspect identiﬁcation to case management and legal proceedings. ProcessGPT has the potential to offer a transformative approach to these workﬂows, enabling automation and, at the same time, acting as a knowledgeable copilot for law enforcement professionals.

# Automation

Law enforcement workﬂows encompass several crucial stages: data aggregation, evidence gathering, data analysis, suspect proﬁling, and decision-making. In the initial stages, investigators spend signiﬁcant time sifting through vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as crime databases, surveillance footage, and witness statements. ProcessGPT can automate this data aggregation, rapidly organizing and contextualizing the information, saving investigators valuable time and effort. For example, by automating the data aggregation process, ProcessGPT signiﬁcantly reduces the time and effort required for investigators to compile evidence. Investigators can focus on analyzing the extracted information and connecting the dots, rather than spending hours locating and gathering data. This automation expedites the investigation process and enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evidence collection. Furthermore, ProcessGPT’s ability to contextualize the gathered information adds value to workﬂow automation. It can analyze the relationships between different pieces of evidence, identify patterns, and highlight potential leads for further investigation.

# Augmentation

By leveraging its comprehensive knowledge base and reasoning abilities, ProcessGPT can generate insightful questions and alternative investigative strategies and provide contextual guidance to investigators. This augmentation aspect helps investigators uncover hidden connections, identify patterns, and consider perspectives that might have been overlooked, enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Additionally, ProcessGPT’s ability to learn from successful investigation patterns, legal precedents, and evolving crime trends empowers it to improve its analytical skills continuously. This evolution ensures that ProcessGPT remains a reliable resource, guiding investigators through complex cases by suggesting relevant leads, recommending potential courses of action, and keeping them updated with the latest developments in the ﬁeld.

# VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this position paper, we proposed using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology to generate new processes to facilitate decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process-related data and models, and then fine-tuning it on specific process domains to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. Through the integration of natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the model can provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Additionally, the model can automate repetitive tasks, improve process efficiency, and enable knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings and make informed decisions.

The application of ProcessGPT in business process management can bring a transformative change. We are exploring the full potential of ProcessGPT in different domains, such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Additionally, a deep dive into the ethical and legal implications of ProcessGPT will be explored. Another line of research focuses on the scalability and sustainability of ProcessGPT to ensure its long-term viability as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workﬂows. In the following, we discuss a few future directions and ongoing works.

# Continuous Learning and Improvement

One promising future direction is to focus on developing sophisticated feedback mechanisms that facilitate user interactions and knowledge exchange. By actively soliciting feedback from users, ProcessGPT can learn from their expertise and incorporate it into its decision-making processes. This feedback loop can involve techniques such as reinforcement learning, where the system learns through trial and error based on the outcomes of its actions, or active learning, which involves selecting informative data points to improve model performance. Moreover, exploring methods to leverage new data continuously is another crucial avenue of research.

# Abstract

The societal vision of sustainable development changes both the context of businesses and expectations that management should contribute to solving sustainability problems beyond organizational boundaries. Companies are influenced by macro-level developments such as new environmental regulations and by meso-level context such as social industry standards and guidelines. At the same time, companies are expected to contribute to sustainability transformations of markets at the meso-level and to solving grand sustainability problems at the macro-level such as the greenhouse effect. These developments increase and change sustainability information needs of managers and management accounting. This paper provides a systematic literature review of how sustainability management accounting (SMA) addresses links with the organization’s contexts and contributions to sustainability transformations beyond organizational boundaries. The analysis questions the conventional assumption of an internal scope for SMA. It recognises this as a problematic constricting assumption in the literature and, instead, proposes a multi-level Context, Action-formation and Transformative contributions (CAT) framework for further development of SMA.

# INTRODUCTION

Involvement of the private corporate sector is vital if sustainable development is to be achieved (Atkinson, 2000). Managers need to consider sustainability in their decisions, and this requires support from accounting to raise awareness of desired and undesired environmental, social and economic impacts (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2018). Corporate sustainability management accounting (SMA) organizes the collection, analysis and communication of environmental, social and economic information for internal use by the organization’s managers. Nevertheless, scepticism about corporate sustainability management, accounting and reporting has been prominent in various publications influencing the research agenda, as some authors see sustainability concerns and solutions resting more at national and global levels than with businesses (Gray, 2010). Moreover, questions arise over the extent to which SMA considers sustainability at societal and planetary boundary levels (Gray, 2010; Linnenluecke & Smith, 2019; Rockström et al., 2009; Whiteman et al., 2013). To make progress with informed corporate sustainability management, SMA needs to support organizations in analysing and managing links with macro- and meso-level.

# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING

sustainability challenges. These include, for example, clarification about how business is integrated in its environment, how it operates within the scope of planetary boundaries, and how it sources supplies without negative sustainability impacts in supply chains.

Emergence of a number of global environmental, social and economic problems, ranging through climate change, water crises, gender equality, global poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic and policies such as the EU Green Deal, has led to greater concern about the lack of sustainability (Eckert & Kovalevska, 2021). It has brought pressure encouraging development of a more comprehensive, integrated approach to corporate sustainability management, supported by accounting and reporting (e.g., Linnenluecke et al., 2015; Whiteman et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a contemporary review and analysis of contexts and outcomes and the potential role of accounting for management to contribute to sustainable development beyond the organization’s boundaries is missing. In order to further develop a research agenda which supports the contribution of business to sustainable development, this review investigates how existing SMA research explicitly considers the connection with sustainability at different levels, leading to the following research question: How does SMA literature address links with meso- and macro-level contexts and outcomes beyond organizational boundaries?

Underpinned by a multi-level framework, this study makes the following contributions. First, it uncovers the extent to which SMA research has explicitly addressed links between the organization, macro-level (e.g., planetary ecological boundaries) and meso-level (e.g., sustainability transformation of supply chains). The review reveals a growing number of publications addressing macro- and meso-micro links. These highlight various aspects of the business environment in general, indicating that regulations, networks and ecological necessities, do or can influence the context for SMA (e.g., Qian et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019). Second, the review indicates few publications examine how SMA could be further developed to better inform management about macro- and meso-level contextual factors. Third, the review findings are problematised by challenging the underlying assumption that the scope of SMA needs to be internal to the organization. Revealing the core idea and purpose of sustainability management and accounting in general, this article proposes that SMA needs to enlarge its scope by considering influences on and impacts of the organization beyond its boundaries. In a business setting facing increasing sustainability problems, SMA can help managers to create contributions to sustainable development of markets, society and the natural environment. It can do this if it provides information to make explicit corporate influences of and impacts on meso- and macro-levels beyond organizational boundaries. Finally, to improve its purpose of supporting management in contributing to sustainable development, reorganization of SMA is proposed through a newly created CAT framework, linking Context, Action-formation and Transformative contributions.

The paper proceeds as follows: the next section distinguishes macro- and meso-level links with SMA and introduces a multi-level framework for analysing these links. The following two sections detail the systematic literature review method adopted and examine the findings from the review within the multi-level framework. The findings are then discussed and problematised in relation to the scope assumption of SMA adopted in the existing SMA multi-level literature, leading to the proposal of a new CAT framework to reorganize SMA. Finally, a short conclusion is presented.

# ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR LINKING SMA WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS

# SMA interacting with multiple analytical levels of sustainable development

Sustainable development is a vision of and for society (UN, 2015). As corporations are embedded in the social and natural environment, they are influenced by and have influence beyond organizational boundaries (Benn et al., 2014). Corporations are key actors able to increase or mitigate social and environmental impacts of mankind, having an impact on this vision (Schaltegger et al., 2017). Previous corporate SMA literature has analysed ways to address sustainability from a corporate perspective. These include reviews of methods (Christ & Burritt, 2015; Dienes et al., 2016), management areas (e.g., Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Vitolla et al., 2019), sustainability orientation (Matthews, 1997) and themes (Marrone et al., 2020). To extend these reviews and analyze the existing organizational SMA (micro) research to meso- and macro-levels of analysis, the paper adopts Coleman’s multi-level framework (1986), as refined by Hedström and Swedberg (1998).

Four reasons lie behind the choice of this conceptual framework. First, the multi-level perspective (MLP) framework (Geels, 2002, 2011) has been widely applied in the transitions literature and provides valuable oversight of system level connections and dynamics. The multi-level approach of Hedström and Swedberg (1998) has informed entrepreneurship research, with its focus on social mechanisms, to explain both enabling influences on the micro- and micro-level impacts on other levels. The framework, therefore, complements the systems view of the MLP perspective by offering a novel analytical lens to analyze the SMA literature with regard to its enabling potential.

# Framework for analysis of SMA links at multiple levels

and to discuss how SMA at the micro-level is influenced by and can contribute to impacts at other levels. Second, the framework allows contributions from different research streams (i.e., accounting, management and sustainability) to be synthesised. Third, the framework requires analysis of the links between context and outcomes (Hedström & Wennberg, 2017). This complements recent dynamic analysis of SMA processes associated with the introduction and use of SMA within organizations (e.g., Burritt et al., 2019). Finally, the framework requires activities at multiple levels to be linked, which helps to provide a comprehensive understanding of SMA and its role in corporate sustainability and sustainable development at larger scales.

According to Hedström and Swedberg (1998), interactions between the different levels of business and society can be analysed in terms of contextual influences, activities that occur at the micro-level, and transformational change fostered by organizations (see Figure 1). The dark arrows in Figure 1 display links connecting macro- and meso-levels with the organizational micro-level where SMA is located.

# Situational mechanisms

(arrow a1 and a2 in Figure 1) describe the contextual and institutional-based processes affecting beliefs, motivations and actions of managers, linking macro- and meso-level conditions to the micro-level of the company.

# Transformational mechanisms

(arrow b1 and b2) explain individual and collective processes of organizations influencing networks and associations at the meso-level, as well as regulations, consumption patterns, life-styles and ecological phenomena at the macro-level. Arrow ‘c’ (action-formation) in Figure 1 represents SMA practices that are adopted at the micro-level. Micro-level SMA activities often result from situational pressures acting on the organization leading to meso and macro transformational change.

# Situational links influencing SMA

Both the macro- and the meso-levels provide a situational context in which organizational actors operate and where changes take place slowly over time (e.g., Hernes, 1998). Macro-micro links are characterised by situational mechanisms influencing SMA through context (arrow a1 in Figure 1). Macro-level concerns about unsustainability can, for example, be related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015), planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009), specific global environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect, or social and environmental government initiatives at the national or supra-national levels.

Meso-micro links (arrow a2 in Figure 1) are characterised by situational social mechanisms that capture the influence of networks on corporate adoption of SMA. Various societal actors, such as international organizations (Greenhouse Gas Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Global Reporting Initiative), sustainability-oriented business networks (Carbon Disclosure Project), and professional accounting organizations (e.g., Sustainability Accounting Standards

# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING

Board) propose approaches to monitor, measure, assess and report on corporate sustainability issues at the corporate level. This shapes the accounting and reporting context at the meso-level, having a substantial influence on the sustainability issues considered in corporate SMA (Nartey, 2018).

At the micro-level (arrow c ‘action-formation’ in Figure 1), entities apply, develop or refrain from using SMA. They mobilise resources and involve partners in the adoption and adaptation of information systems for sustainability (Melville, 2010; Seidel et al., 2013). The micro-level is also a key place where innovations emerge (Geels, 2002; Kemp et al., 2001; Smith & Raven, 2012). Organizations react to situational influences beyond organizational boundaries (Geels, 2010), including niche interactions with incumbents (Geels, 2019). As SMA requires new approaches and innovations different from conventional accounting, the micro-level is crucial for SMA research, experimentation and practice (e.g., Burritt et al., 2019), development of capabilities (Albertini, 2019) and competencies (Ascui & Lovell, 2012). New SMA approaches are developed through dedicated arrangements of actors, pioneering companies, external research projects and citizen’s initiatives. Where companies see sustainability as a means to obtain benefit, the situational context is important for SMA development, but not always essential if managers have a well-developed social conscience.

Analyzing situational links between the macro-, meso- and micro-levels helps with understanding why certain SMA approaches emerge and how companies react to the broader business context. The potential contribution of SMA to creating solutions to planetary environmental and social challenges requires investigation of the transformational outcomes at the meso- and macro-levels (Loorbach et al., 2010) that result from SMA activity and adoption.

# Transformational links of SMA influence

Sustainability transformations involve multi-party participation at different levels, akin to a transdisciplinary approach (e.g., Lang et al., 2012) to setting strategic long-term goals (e.g., Loorbach et al., 2010), experimenting with different situations and tools, and linking the long-term aims of the different parties with pragmatic short-term actions to achieve these (Rotmans et al., 2001). If SMA is to be effective in supporting improved management decisions then processes which create impacts at the societal meso-level of markets and networks (transformational link b2) as well as at the macro-level (transformational link b1), should be initiated in the corporation at the micro-level.

Transformational mechanisms linking the micro- and meso-levels of analysis address the influence of micro-level SMA development and use on networks, industry associations and markets at the meso-level. These links capture the influence of SMA adoption on establishing industry initiatives for SMA, sustainability-oriented industry associations, professional accounting organizations issuing reports on SMA, and sustainability awards (e.g., Hansen et al., 2010). Transformational links between micro-level development of innovative methods of SMA, with disseminating organizations at the meso-level, potentially play an important role in altering unsustainable practices and creating new, more sustainable professional and industry-based standards. These, in turn, can subsequently exert situational influence on the whole industry and economy towards sustainability.

Transformational mechanisms linking micro- and macro-levels of analysis address the involvement of SMA effects on wider global societal and planetary ecological areas and governments, with sustainable development as the ultimate goal. This link addresses, for instance, the influence of pioneer companies on regional and government programs and regulations as well as the contribution of SMA information to macro-level sustainability accounts.

For SMA to contribute to creating sustainable development requires situational and transformational links, between the corporation and the meso- and macro-levels, be addressed. To structure analysis of how SMA literature has addressed these links, a multi-level framework is adopted.

# RESEARCH METHOD

Based on Tranfield et al. (2003), a systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant prior research (Breslin et al., 2019). The method has been applied in sustainability, management (e.g., Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Vitolla et al., 2019) and accounting (e.g., Hansen & Schaltegger, 2016; Lavia López & Hiebl, 2015) research. The literature is organized using the multi-level framework originally proposed by Coleman (1986) and refined by Hedström and Swedberg (1998). The analysis of existing literature problematises key assumptions SMA research has adopted from conventional management accounting. It proposes a new Context, Action, Transformation (CAT) framework for SMA research and practice and suggests a new assumption on scope be adopted in future SMA research.

(Meho & Yang, 2007). Table 2 shows the search yielded 5456 articles to the end of 2019. The final number of articles for analysis, after data cleaning (as described) and adjustments, was 62 high quality peer-reviewed journal articles.

The goal was to include reviewed articles that address multi-level linkages with SMA. In the analysis of title and abstract, articles which only mention SMA issues at the margin, such as those dealing with broader corporate social responsibility issues, external communication, reporting and disclosure of sustainability aspects, were excluded. Furthermore, with the focus on for-profit companies, articles were excluded that examine an entire economy, local or regional areas, governments, municipalities, non-profits and public sectors. Likewise, articles dealing with sustainability accounting from an engineering perspective focusing on technical analysis or on different forms of sustainability accounting for ecosystems, forests or other natural habitats, were excluded to ensure a clear focus for the study.

Intercoder agreement on the exclusion criteria was assessed using the Krippendorff α (Krippendorff, 2013; Lombard et al., 2002) based on a SPSS macro by Hayes and Krippendorff (2007). All four authors reviewed 30 randomly chosen articles and rated whether they should be included in the sample based on the exclusion criteria given above. The results were discussed to achieve agreement and then new sets of randomly chosen articles were rated until agreement by all authors was reached at the threshold of Krippendorff.

By applying the exclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts, a total of 763 articles was removed from the sample.

Despite a rigorous review of titles and abstracts, the full text analysis revealed that many articles did not have the desired focus on SMA. Therefore, the exclusion criteria mentioned above were also applied when reading the articles in their entirety. In the full text review, two authors searched for links to the meso level and two authors for links to the macro level while also assuring that all articles explicitly dealt with SMA. To double-check these results, the teams then reversed their focus. It was found that many articles mention a link to the macro or meso level. However, most papers address these links as a side concern, or use them to set the scene in relation to the specific accounting issue examined. Therefore, differentiation was made between articles that solely mention a link and those that deal with a link in depth. Only the latter are included in the final sample, to which three articles were added as a result of expert recommendation. In the full text review, 259 articles were excluded that did fit the exclusion criteria or had no meso or macro link. Only papers that explicitly considered situational or transformational links to and from micro- to meso- and macro-levels of analysis and deal with SMA are included in the final sample and are listed by number in the Appendix.

Finally, to conceptualise the analysis of the identified literature dealing with SMA links, a framework (see ‘Discussion’ below where the framework is proposed) was abductively developed in a continuous iteration between the data (the reviewed articles) and the theory that informed the analysis (multi-level perspective distinguishing social mechanisms).

# FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE

In total, 62 research papers were identified as thoroughly and explicitly addressing links between corporate SMA and meso- and macro-levels. Overall, more of these papers deal with situational (53 articles) than with transformational links (23 articles) and more discuss SMA links with the meso-level (55 articles) than the macro-level (36 articles).

In relation to the multi-level framework, the set of articles addressing multiple links is analysed first for situational links and second for transformational links before a key underlying assumption behind all SMA literature is problematised.

Literature mapped against the multi-level framework

Contexts to SMA at the organizational level. Situational links (arrows a1 and a2 in Figure 1) describe how external issues influence whether, what and how organizations take-up and develop SMA. Table 4 provides an overview of different topics that have been specifically addressed in the accounting literature and explanations as to how they link either macro- or meso-levels with SMA at the micro-level.

Among the situational links to SMA, in the publications analyzed (Table 3), meso-level influences (40 articles) are considered more than macro-level impacts (25 articles). This reflects the importance of stakeholder relationships with industry associations, professional accounting organizations and sustainable business networks for introducing and developing SMA in organizations (e.g., Ascui & Lovell, 2012; Rodrigue et al., 2013). For example, Burritt et al. (2019), while mentioning macro topics briefly in the introduction, emphasise meso-level influences when explaining why and how a company started to engage with SMA. With few exceptions (e.g., Hörisch et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2018) the literature, while developing tools, processes and accounting systems for use by management, assumes that the application of SMA will (somehow) contribute to sustainable development (e.g., Atkinson, 2000; Hansen et al., 2010; Jalaludin et al., 2011), leaving the issue of scope to later research.

Publications at the macro-level informing situational mechanisms, which are discussed in the existing literature with regard to influencing SMA adoption and development in organizations, cover a wide range of single influencing factors, including regulations (e.g., carbon management accounting, to comply with the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) (e.g., Ascui & Lovell, 2012), ETS related standards on how companies should monitor, collect and report carbon emissions (Stechemesser & Günther, 2012), international agreements such as the Kyoto protocol and related national and supra-national regulations shaping the introduction and design of SMA with regard to carbon accounting (Bui & Fowler, 2019), direct stakeholders of a company (e.g., Mokhtar et al., 2016), accounting standards (e.g., Zou et al., 2019), international organizations (e.g., Burritt and Christ, 2017) and business associations, media and NGO pressure (e.g., Wang et al., 2019).

Topics include the influence of global, large scale and national institutions on SMA. Most prominent are references to global ecological problems (Hartmann et al., 2013; Lee, 2012), planetary boundaries (e.g., Schaltegger, 2018), unmet societal needs (e.g., Bui & Fowler, 2019) as well as, more recently, the SDGs (Nartey, 2018). A large number of SMA publications (259) are framed adding just a few sentences on global environmental and social problems. Only 53 publications (e.g., Nartey, 2018; Scavone, 2006) analyze situational mechanisms in some depth. These papers examine whether and how scientific information about sustainability problems, national regulations (e.g., Bui & Fowler, 2019, on the link between European and New Zealand climate change policies and standards for corporate carbon accounting), supra-national agreements (like the EU ETS), SDGs, and others at the societal.

macro-level, influence the take-up and design of SMA. An increasing number of human rights related reporting requirements and regulations (e.g., the UK Modern Slavery Act and the US Dodd-Frank Act) has been addressed, creating the necessity for SMA to deal with social problems at the macro-level. While human rights reports on the global situation encourage companies to consider human rights aspects with SMA (e.g., Christ et al., 2019; McPhail & Ferguson, 2016) research is still challenged to develop more concrete social management accounting and encompassing SMA methods at the corporate level.

Situational mechanisms addressed in the existing literature linking the meso- and micro-level SMA adoption and development in organizations include the role of accounting standards facilitating conservation of the natural environment (e.g., Aladwan, 2018), professional accounting organizations promoting SMA (e.g., issuing guidelines, expert reports, opinion pieces) and business networks disseminating and supporting SMA knowledge (e.g., material flow cost accounting, Günther et al., 2015). For example, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has a framework and requests data on greenhouse gas emissions from companies, as published in CDP databases and reports (CDP, 2011). As the data is requested in a standardised format CDP influences corporate SMA at the micro-level and the way they collect, aggregate and report greenhouse gas information. CDP has a similar approach for water data influencing water management accounting at the micro-level (CDP, 2020; Christ & Burritt, 2017). Qian and Schaltegger (2017) provided empirical evidence that CDP disclosure requirements have led to improved corporate carbon management performance, and the influence of the GHG Protocol for accounting and reporting of greenhouse gases by corporations (GHG Protocol, 2004) on the adoption of.

# Transformational links of SMA fostering sustainable development

If companies and their SMA approaches are to foster sustainable development, then the transformational mechanisms linking the organizational micro-level of SMA with macro- and meso-level impacts must be effective. Only a small number of publications have addressed transformational links between SMA and meso- (15) and macro- (11) levels (Table 3). The development of innovative SMA methods, however, can only create recognisable sustainability contributions in industries and markets if disseminating organizations at the meso-level help change existing unsustainable practices and create new, more sustainable professional and industry standards. Whether companies can become drivers of sustainability transformations of markets and society and of standard setting, and whether SMA can be a helpful approach in this context, needs to be assessed with regard to the effects of SMA on macro-level sustainability goals such as planetary boundaries (Schaltegger, 2018) and the SDGs (Bebbington & Unerman, 2018). Table 5 provides a summary of topics about transformational links, which have been explicitly addressed in the existing SMA literature.

Transformational mechanisms connecting the micro-level of SMA involvement of organizations with the meso-level entails presenting SMA innovations with the aim of promoting SMA to create sustainability improvements for many actors (e.g., for involving stakeholders, see Hansen et al., 2010), of forming and supporting SMA networks (e.g., Rodrigue et al., 2013), of considering value-creating stakeholder partnerships in SMA (Mitchell et al., 2015), and of applying SMA with the goal of transforming markets and supply chains towards sustainable development (e.g., Koh et al., 2013; Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Schaltegger & Burritt, 2014; Spence & Rinaldi, 2014). The arguments examining use of SMA to help transform supply chains often reflects a relational view based on the importance of the supply chain to the social and environmental impacts of the business (e.g., Lee, 2012; Koh et al., 2013; Nakano & Hirao, 2011).

A prominent example of the influence of micro-meso transformational mechanisms is the development and introduction of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) guideline and the ISO 14051 standard on material flow cost accounting fostered by an increasing number of companies adopting material flow cost accounting (MFCA) (Jasch, 2008). MFCA was developed at the micro-level in transdisciplinary projects between universities, companies and consulting organizations (Herzig et al., 2012; Jasch, 2008), eventually promoted by a UN Division for Sustainable Development (DSD) project (UN DSD, 2001) in a workbook on environmental management accounting (EMA) and feeding into an IFAC guideline on EMA, particularly MFCA (IFAC, 2005). Later, driven largely by Japanese academics in collaboration with companies, the ISO 14051 MFCA standard (meso-level) was developed (Nakajima et al. 2015). In Japan, the ISO standard 14051 was at a later stage even taken up at the macro-level by the government and federal ministries (Kokubu & Kitada, 2015).

Micro-macro transformational mechanisms are notably underdeveloped in extant research. Mechanisms which are addressed in the existing accounting literature include fostering the transformation of micro institutions towards low carbon impact and sustainable development (Ascui & Lovell, 2012; Schaltegger & Csutora, 2012), supporting the creation of new regulations supporting the uptake of.

An example of aiming to establish a micro-macro link by developing a transformational mechanism based on SMA information is the actions and advocacy of member companies of the Science Based Targets Initiative (Faria & Labutong, 2019). Each member company calculates the necessary greenhouse gas reductions to improve.

# Discussion, Problematization and Future Research

Results of the systematic review of contextual and transformational aspects of SMA literature indicate a low take-up of research that considers linkages between SMA at the organizational micro-level with meso- and macro-levels (62 of 321 identified SMA publications).

This section reflects upon a main assumption in the literature about the scope of SMA. It argues for extending the scope of SMA beyond the internal, to go beyond organizational boundaries, discusses implications of such a change and proposes a new CAT (context, action, transformation) framework to organize SMA in line with the proposed extended scope.

# SMA Research Opportunities Addressing Situational Links

The emphasis on situational links in the existing literature can be seen as an indication of a reactive perspective, the introduction and adaptation of SMA under pressure from external influences. While reactive uptake of SMA could represent business practice (see Christ, 2014; Hartmann et al., 2013; Pondeville et al., 2013), it could also reflect what researchers expect from businesses. The results also indicate that research has adopted the assumption that SMA’s scope is internal to the organization. Overall, the SMA research addressing situational links discusses consequences for SMA to support internal company process improvements. With this internal focus, the existing SMA literature has not explicitly analyzed how SMA could be developed to link situational influences with contributions of the company towards solving sustainable development problems beyond the organization’s boundaries.

For example, in relation to the analysis of macro-micro links, current research does not investigate the role of government actions and the impact of government failure (Ekins et al., 2003) on SMA development. Government failure can range from maintaining the unsustainable status quo of political and societal contexts, to institutional voids (e.g., Doh et al., 2017). It includes bureaucracy failure, the politics of power and the focus on elections instead of solving sustainability problems. For SMA, government failure leads to accounting regulations which ensure that management is under-informed about sustainability crises (Maunders & Burritt, 1991). Although some authors mention government failure as a source of sustainability problems in their SMA-related articles (e.g., Milne & Grubnic, 2011; Nartey, 2018), the topic has not been analyzed in depth in relation to situational influences on SMA. Of recent interest is that government regulations, such as policies and regulations introducing a Circular Economy (e.g., EC, 2020a, 2020b), could be analyzed in relation to how moves towards a Circular Economy could help foster SMA.

Only a few publications have started to address links between SMA, the UN SDGs (e.g., Bebbington & Unerman, 2018) and other international agreements (e.g., Kyoto and Paris GHG protocol), although the macro-level can, and...

# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING

increasingly does, require certain topics to be considered in SMA (e.g., the US Dodd-Frank Act or UK Modern Slavery Act with regard to human rights issues in supply chains; e.g., Silva & Schaltegger, 2019).

Also, not addressed in depth with regard to the uptake and design of SMA is the influence of macro-level accounts on the global state and deterioration of the natural environment (e.g., the WWF living planet report; WWF, 2018) as well as reports on key global social problems of humankind (e.g., Walk Free Foundation, 2018) shaping the understanding of managers, employees and stakeholders about whether and how their company operations and products relate to large-scale sustainability problems. Likewise, the influence of EU policy aiming to foster a circular economy has not been investigated in depth in the SMA literature although it shapes the macro business environment of companies operating in the EU in relation to material flows, waste streams, reuse and recycling (EC, 2020a, 2020b), and explicitly requires monitoring, tracking and tracing of material flows at the corporate micro-level.

In relation to meso-micro links market failure could also be investigated with regard to meso-micro link consequences for SMA. While international and national accounting institutions mostly neglect market failure and developing markets for renewable energy, new regulations such as emissions trading and carbon compensation, are creating additional needs and incentives for companies to consider SMA. Existing research mentions market developments such as a growing demand for carbon neutral products (Milne & Grubnic, 2011), but does not analyse how these situational influences could inform SMA to account for transformational sustainability contributions of products.

With the exception of Ascui and Lovell (2012), also not addressed is the influence of voluntary accounting standard setters on SMA. These include the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and accountancy professional bodies such as the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). In addition, research on links between the UN reports directly addressing SMA (UN DSD, 2001, 2002) as well as GRI and IR voluntary standards for external reporting and SMA have yet to be closely examined.

Another underexamined situational mechanism, linking meso- with micro-levels of SMA, is expectations and influences of societal stakeholders (Silva et al., 2019) and social movements as ‘purposive and collective attempts of a number of people to change societal institutions and structures’ (Sine & Lee, 2009, p. 123). Apart from recent social movements, such as the ‘Fridays for Future’ movement, various environmental and social networks have addressed partial aspects of SMA, like the Earth Day movement (www.earthday.org), the International Women’s Day and call to action (www.internationalwomensday.com), and the Ecological Footprint Network (www.footprintnetwork.org; Dao et al., 2018). As there is no in-depth discussion of such movements with regard to their influence on SMA future research could investigate how they constrain, enable and shape measures and themes used in corporate SMA practices.

# SMA research opportunities addressing transformational links

While the small amount of SMA multi-level research focuses on contextual regulations and guidelines, it is apparent that few studies require SMA to account for transformational sustainability contributions of companies.

At the micro-macro level, few publications address links between SMA and the impact on specific environmental outcomes beyond the organizational boundaries (e.g., Hörisch et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2018), and none of the identified SMA publications deal with how effective the application of SMA methods is in meeting social goals. For example, while the Science Based Target Initiative aims to establish direct links between corporate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming goals, with one exception (Faria & Labutong, 2019), the link between different SMA approaches and contributions to combatting global warming has not been analysed. Instead, the scope of SMA research is restricted to specific internal issues, such as energy and material flows (Dunuwila et al., 2018), health and safety (Jasch & Lavicka, 2006), water (Christ & Burritt, 2017), biodiversity (Siddiqui, 2013), waste (Fakoya & van der Poll, 2013) and their measurement to support different types of managers. While reducing material flows, saving water and avoiding waste are all seen in the analysed literature to make important contributions to reducing the environmental burden of corporations and their products, there is no guarantee that these activities necessarily or inevitably lead to sufficient improvement at the societal or ecosystem level.

At the micro-meso level, with regard to transformation, the small number of publications touching upon mechanisms linking SMA and the meso-level of analysis includes the connection of SMA with supply chains (e.g., Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019; Schaltegger & Burritt, 2014; Spence & Rinaldi, 2014). Arguments reflect a relational view based on importance of the supply chain to the social and environmental impacts of the business (e.g., Nakano & Hirao, 2011; Lee, 2012; Koh et al., 2013). Measuring sustainability

# Impacts of the Supply Chain

Impacts of the supply chain is a key area in which SMA could create transformational impacts (e.g., Beske-Janssen et al., 2015; Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019), yet, research is still needed to develop effective SMA approaches for doing so.

# SMA and Stakeholder Engagement

SMA and stakeholder engagement (Burritt & Schaltegger, 2010) has commenced through publications on accounting for stakeholders and shared-value creation (e.g., Harrison & van der Laan Smith, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2015, Hörisch et al., 2020). These articles could provide a basis for exploring the importance of SMA for stakeholders in transformational processes. The research would need to find SMA approaches that aim at creating sustainability improvements for many stakeholders. Apart from the challenge to create value for both companies and society, developing SMA would also have to discuss how creating improvements of two or more sustainability aspects could be achieved (e.g., combined biodiversity and poverty improvements pursued by different stakeholders).

# SMA and Micro-Macro Links

SMA and micro-macro links are hardly touched upon in the existing sample of publications, again presenting opportunities for future research, for example, SMA and gender equality and global poverty. As most of the research literature has focused on specific internal issues in the organization (e.g., material flows) other important impacts of the company or its products with regard to the grand picture of sustainable development as expressed in the UN SDGs or the planetary boundary concept may be missed.

Finally, only three articles address both, the meso- and macro-situational and transformational levels of analysis. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of these articles reveals that the levels are addressed separately and that the interaction between transformative influences of SMA on the meso-level with possible subsequent influences on the macro-level has not been investigated.

# Problematizing the Internal Scope Assumption of SMA

Management accounting by definition has internal organizational addressees. Furthermore, it has been based on the assumption that the purpose of management is to increase profits by optimizing organizational processes (e.g., innovation, production, logistics) and therefore has an internal scope (Horngren, 2004). Likewise, the review of SMA literature reveals an internal scope with an implicit separation of the recognition of external context from the development of internal SMA methods. It may appear paradoxical that publications mentioning links to meso- and macro-levels beyond the organizational boundaries imply that the scope of SMA should be on issues internal to the organization. Such an internal focus of SMA, however, can be explained by the adoption of the internal scope assumption of conventional management accounting.

As a result, only a few of the publications addressing multi-level issues (e.g., Gibassier & Alcouffe, 2018; Schaltegger, 2018) have explicitly considered that SMA should extend the accounting scope beyond organizational boundaries. With the shortage of research which looks beyond the assumed internal scope of SMA the issue needs to be problematised (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011). Results from the SMA literature contrast with strategic, sustainability-oriented management literature. This literature emphasises that companies are embedded in a business environment and should consider stakeholders, regulations and guidelines in their decisions, including internal management decisions (e.g., Antolín-López et al., 2016; Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017; Hörisch et al., 2014).

The existing SMA literature has so far invisibly adopted the assumption of an internal scope by focusing on optimizing company production processes, material and energy flows and investments. This implies the SMA focus is on helping to develop the organization towards its own sustainable development. However, as sustainable development is a normative societal vision, to help towards achieving this vision, SMA needs an enlarged scope that considers influences from and on the outside as well as impacts of the organization within its boundary (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2017; Schaltegger, 2018). Such an extension of the scope of SMA is also in line with the transformation necessities identified in the sustainability transition literature (Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013; Williams & Robinson, 2020).

As long as SMA continues to adopt the conventional management accounting assumption of an internal scope it reinforces the view that internal optimisations will suffice to meet external expectations about contributions towards sustainability. SMA based on the internal scope assumption of management accounting results in managers being ill-informed about sustainability relevant issues, with the effect that SMA does not support broader transformational change. If SMA is to contribute to the societal vision of sustainable development it should be designed with the purpose of supporting managers in creating external contributions of organizations to sustainable development of markets, society and the natural environment. The question of whether planned and achieved sustainability improvements are sufficient to achieve effective contributions to sustainable development at the global macro-level, therefore, needs to be brought into the focus of SMA.

The next section proposes a new assumption and goal for SMA that addresses the identified multi-level links between SMA and sustainable development for which the literature review has been a catalyst.

# CAT framework to organize SMA

The embeddedness of organizations in meso- and macro-level contexts as well as the inevitable influence of organizations on these levels requires management to be better informed with SMA about how situational topics and mechanisms can intrigue sustainability management of the business, and how the effectiveness of the organization’s contributions to sustainability transformations can be measured and communicated.

To conceptualise the analysis, a framework was abductively developed in a continuous iteration between the data (the reviewed articles) and the theory that informed the analysis from a multilevel perspective. Based on analysis of the existing literature, and by referring to the social mechanisms framework that distinguishes situational (context), action-formation and transformational mechanisms, a CAT (context, action, transformation) framework to reorganize SMA is proposed as follows:

1. Context: Performance is achievement in relation to certain expectations or goals. Managing performance therefore requires being informed about external requirements and expectations. To contribute to sustainable development first requires an understanding of scientific and societal requirements from the macro-level of analysis (e.g., planetary boundaries) as well as stakeholder expectations expressed in regulations, guidelines and standards at the meso-level (left side of Figure 3). As sustainability is a complex, multifaceted vision with many different goals a structured account is needed.
2. Action: SMA for the company’s actions is what current research literature has mostly focused on. The key question to be answered by SMA for management actions includes what social and environmental activities are conducted with what immediate economic (e.g., costs of investment in energy saving devices), social (e.g., safety improvement at working place) and environmental implications (e.g., energy savings achieved and carbon emissions reduced)?

multiple SMA methods, such as material flow cost accounting, safety and environmental investment appraisals. While internal actions in the organization have been the main focus of most SMA methods so far, the existing approaches have considered context with regard to the expectations of the own actions only partially. Implementation of material flow cost accounting in line with the ISO 14051 standard (Kokubu & Kitada, 2015), or developing carbon accounting with regard to regulatory requirements of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, have been investigated (Ascui & Lovell, 2012). Explicit links to whether planetary boundary conditions or UN SDGs are considered (e.g., in MFCA) and what consequences need to be drawn for benchmarking, goal setting, etc. has only more recently been addressed as a requirement and needs further development of SMA with regard to creating contributions to sustainability transformations beyond organizational boundaries.

# c. Transformation

The assumption that internal improvements in an organization will invariably lead to sustainability, has been questioned in the existing literature (Gray, 2010), but it has not informed research into how SMA could be further developed to ensure effective sustainability contributions beyond the organization. Whether and to what extent the company contributes to societal and scientifically developed environmental goals is, however, crucial information managers need to develop a sustainable business (Hörisch et al., 2014). SMA is therefore challenged to create information to answer the key transformational question, how does the company contribute to sustainable development beyond its organizational boundaries; that is, a sustainable development of supply chains, markets, society and the natural environment? Sustainable entrepreneurship literature suggests that organizations can contribute to sustainable development (Sheperd and Patzelt, 2011) and further sustainability research has frequently called managers to think about such effects of their activities on the macro- and meso- levels (Johnson & Schaltegger, 2020). SMA needs to be linked as explicitly as possible to key sustainability concepts such as planetary boundaries and the SDGs which relate to social, economic and ecological conditions beyond the confines of the organization. To assess whether the business contributes sufficiently to sustainable development therefore requires measurement and disclosure of the negative and positive sustainability impacts and contributions of the organization to networks (guideline development, standards development), markets (sustainability change of markets and consumption patterns), society (change of life styles) and the natural environment.

The CAT framework has various intended methodological implications for SMA, including: the necessity for backcasting from macro-level sustainability problems for benchmarking purposes in SMA; a focus on management guidance, integrating different sustainability issues to ensure comprehensive contributions to sustainable development; and moving from ex post-tracking to future-oriented action and transformation:

# Backcasting to develop benchmarks

Backcasting rather than forecasting has been proposed in the sustainability science literature (Holmberg & Robèrt, 2000) to create a database and goals with regard to achieving sustainable development. Backcasting aims to calculate the necessary reductions at a global scale to stay in the limits of a 2-degree Celsius increase to global climate, and it can be broken down for industries and individual companies (e.g., Schaltegger et al., 2017). This shows the amount of greenhouse gas emissions an individual company must reduce to be in line with an economy operating within planetary boundaries. Such alignment of sustainability accounting and benchmarking with macro-level planetary boundary targets serves to establish micro-macro-level transformational mechanisms, which may help managers to set and achieve the goal to transform the own company to be in line with planetary boundaries. With regard to planetary boundaries, the Science Based Target Initiative (https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) provides a novel approach providing macro-level benchmarks establishing a link between SMA and the 1.5-degree Celsius goals of the Paris agreement to combat climate and to create meaningful informational value for manager.

# Management guidance in addition to transparency

Creating transparency has been highlighted in the existing literature as a key goal for social, environmental and sustainability accounting (e.g., Gray 1992). Much of the literature has also addressed reporting as an important aspect of sustainability accounting (e.g., Adams, 2008; Antonini & Larrinaga, 2017; de Villiers & Sharma, 2020). However, while transparency certainly has its value to inform management and stakeholders, to create awareness about problems, challenges and changes (whether improvements or deteriorations), transparency alone does not lead to management actions and sustainability transformations. As the Volkswagen ‘diesel gate’ case has shown, excellent reporting practices (e.g., Isenmann et al., 2007) are neither sufficient to motivate nor to guide managers to create excellent environmental and social performance with regard to the grand sustainability challenges relating to planetary boundaries and the SDGs. In spite of that, empirical research shows that, on average, improved disclosure quality leads to improved environmental performance of large companies (Qian & Schaltegger, 2017). Sustainability accounting that supports management to

# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING

make better decisions with regard to sustainability needs to provide guidance with regard to macro-level sustainability challenges. This research suggests to investigate whether a new type of report – a ’Corporate Sustainability Transformation Statement’ could provide more guidance to managers to bridge the gap from SMA at the organizational micro-level to meso- and macro-levels. Recent global warming literature has touched on such an approach at the facilities level for companies operating in Australia (Australian Government, 2020), but such an approach has not been proposed for the corporate level, so far. Such a sustainability transformation statement could foster SMA projections with regard to meso- and macro-level action and transformational aims, and would also involve audit and assurance for such a new statement.

Integrating different sustainability issues to develop comprehensive contributions to sustainable development. Integrating social, environmental and economic perspectives remains somewhat abstract and insufficiently tangible for most managers in corporate practice. Furthermore, material flow management and accounting still does not provide information about whether the improvements achieved create trade-offs between different global sustainability goals. For example, the reduction of greenhouse gases by means of planting trees (Bastin et al., 2019) may contribute to combatting climate change and may be achieved in a socially and economically beneficial way. However, the means chosen to achieve this climate-related goal could potentially impact another planetary boundary: biodiversity (Veldman et al., 2019). From an overarching sustainability perspective, integration thus has a new meaning beyond the ‘environmental-social-economic’. Sustainability accounting research and practice is challenged to develop approaches to measure and assess crossing and side-effects between different SDGs as well as between different planetary boundaries.

Moving from ex post-tracking to future-oriented action and transformation. Social and environmental accounting and reporting largely focus on the provision of past data to external parties, but communication in this way does not lead to action per se. While SMA, as with all management accounting, has so far focused on accounting using past and contemporary data to assist managers with decision making, taking actions leading to transformations towards sustainability would necessarily be concerned with data about the future.

This analysis of the existing SMA literature also has implications for research beyond the accounting discipline. Analyses on how well SMA supports managers and organizations to create effective sustainability contributions also becomes important for research on sustainable entrepreneurship (which assumes that social and green entrepreneurs can contribute to sustainability transformations of markets and sustainable development of society; e.g., Hockerts & Wüstenhagen, 2010). Only if entrepreneurs contribute effectively to meso- and macro-level transformations the promises of sustainable entrepreneurship hold true.

For innovation management, questions of fostering SMA dissemination in organizations to translate context changes into organizational processes and structures and to understand how situational mechanisms and related management actions help transforming organizations may be of particular interest. Silva et al. (2019) suggest to involve stakeholders in the assessment of sustainability performance to overcome the situation that most practitioners find the sustainability assessment and measurement approaches proposed in the research literature of little practical value and therefore do not apply them in practice. This raises the question how SMA could be further developed as an approach that involves stakeholders in assessing context factors and in contributing to sustainability transformations.

Policy and governance research could examine the effectiveness of different macro- and meso-level contexts and situational mechanisms on SMA introduction and adoption. For the last decade, various publications in the general corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility domain have addressed the political role of companies and how companies can try to motivate business associations, influence regulations (Marques, 2017). The purpose of corporate political activities is to influence or create the future situational context through legislation for other companies to adopt a certain sustainability approach or issue as well. The accounting literature, however, has not dealt in depth with how SMA could contribute to the political role of companies in fostering sustainability transformations of professional accounting and business associations, markets or regulations.

# CONCLUSION

SMA research has large development potential, both with regard to methods as well as dissemination. Analysis of the existing research literature on SMA suggests that innovation potential could be unleashed by reframing the role of SMA based on an extended scope that explicitly addresses context and transformational contributions, and links them with the organization’s activities as proposed with the CAT framework.

Most social, environmental and sustainability accounting publications are focused only on the organizational level. While this focus is understandable, it has been criticised for many years as being too narrow (Marland et al., 2015; Milne, 1996; Stechemesser & Günther, 2012). In

# 1. Introduction

In corporate practice, reference points to assess an organization’s sustainability performance are either past emission levels, own reduction goals, the industry average or best practices (Bradley et al., 2013). Such information, however, does not tell us anything about whether the respective reductions are sufficient to achieve SDGs or be in line with an economy operating in the safe space of planetary boundaries. Corporate sustainability includes contributing to sustainability transformations not just of the organization but also of markets at the meso-level and sustainability transformations of society at the macro-level (Patterson et al., 2017). Until now, practically no methods have been proposed as to how to broaden the management accounting scope including linkages to the meso- and macro-level in an effective way, which would be meaningful for company managers with regard to their job duties at the organizational level and create effective contributions to sustainability transitions beyond organizational boundaries. Accounting research is therefore challenged to develop innovations that enable SMA to translate situational influences on the organization and its management accounting to transformational contributions that support sustainable development.

# 2. Implications of the CAT Framework

The intended implications of the CAT framework for SMA include the necessity for backcasting from macro-level sustainability problems for benchmarking purposes in the organization with SMA to explicitly consider the organization’s embedding in society and the natural environment. In addition, the implications include the need to integrate different sustainability issues to ensure comprehensive contributions to sustainable development, and moving from ex post-tracking to future-oriented action with the framework’s focus on management guidance towards creating effective contributions to sustainability transformations.

# Abstract

Organizations have been showing a growing awareness regarding the importance of corporate sustainability. However, the integration of sustainability concerns in companies' long-term planning, strategic management, processes, and activities is still challenging, disconnected, and often conducted in isolation. Based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature, the present research presents a theoretical framework that is expected to enhance the adequate development and management of organizational sustainability-oriented practices — the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model. This model provides organizational managers with a structured framework to adequately understand, select, implement and assess sustainability promoting actions, based on the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools and involving the exchange of collaborative ideas between organizational stakeholders. The adoption of the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model is expected to foster change processes and innovations in the search for solutions for sustainability-oriented business models.

The last five decades have witnessed a growing concern and a broad and important discussion regarding the impact of unsustainable practices. Scholars, professionals, and even common citizens are highly aware of the need to study and change behaviours (Rockstrom et al., 2009). Figure 1 shows main approaches and contributions regarding the implementation of the necessary changes towards sustainability and well-being.

Concerned about the importance of adequately understanding the consequences of human development, the implications of its impacts and the problems caused by a changing lifestyle, the United Nations (UN), during its Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 (UN, 1972), introduced the principles that would later support the concept of sustainable development1 (SD). This concept would become a sociopolitical, economic, and environmental objective, ratified by the Brundtland Commission in the document entitled “Our Common Future” (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). Based on this work, Elkington suggests the understanding of sustainability through a three-dimensional vision, known as “triple bottom line” (TBL) (Elkington, 1999). Sustainability will be achieved through the adequate balance, in each moment, of the economic capital and its profitability, the environmental capital and its preservation, and the social capital and its equity (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, & Filho, 2014).

The definition of SD proposed in the Brundtland report is simple and attractive and has inspired different definitions for corporate sustainability (CS) — namely, the one developed by Dyllick and Hockerts (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002) and the one developed by Bansal (Bansal, 2005). However, all these definitions have the disadvantage of being vague, which hinders their adequate understanding and operationalization (Lankoski, 2016; Poddar, Narula, & Zutshi, 2019). Therefore, organizations face

considerable challenges to attend to different stakeholders expectations and to adapt to the different socioeconomic and environmental-economic dynamics (Ostrom, 2009).

In spite of these difficulties, an increasing number of organizations are recognizing the importance of sustainability dimensions and are demonstrating their commitment to sustainability through the integration of this concept in their strategies and management models (Armindo, Fonseca, Abreu, & Toldy, 2019; Stubbs, 2019). According to recent studies, in most cases, the implementation of these strategies has been more superficial than effective, consisting of little more than a response to stakeholders pressures regarding responsible business performances (Schrettle, Hinz, Scherrer -Rathje, & Friedli, 2014). Therefore, it is still very important to continue studying the relation between organizational commitment towards sustainability and its effective implementation and performance.

This scenario leads to the need of developing new proposals aiming the orientation and promotion of organizational involvement with sustainability, leading to the reformulation of organizational behaviours. In this scope, the General Assembly of the UN has defined, in 2015, a new agenda for SD based on 17 principles that led to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), defending that sustainable production and consumption should be widely adopted by 2030 (UN, 2015).

For this transformation to take place, organizations need to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to promote SD (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002; UN, 2015) and to adequately understand the mechanisms and interactions needed to integrate improved performances for the organization with improved performances for the environment and also for the different organizational stakeholders (Hörisch, Freeman, & Schaltegger, 2014). This implies the construction of a proactive organizational culture, which will determine how sustainability will be thought, acted, and experienced (Baumgartner, 2014), leading top management towards the adequate understanding of which initiatives should be developed, by whom and for what reason (Manning, Braam, & Reimsbach, 2019).

The will to implement sustainability practices should be clearly expressed in organizational strategies, namely, through the economic perspective of the social and environmental dimensions, the mitigation of negative environmental impacts caused by the organization's activities, and the creation of tangible value and benefits for society in the short, medium, and long term (Aarseth, Ahola, Aaltonen, Økland, & Andersen, 2017). To achieve this, the business model should reflect its strategic will to balance the TBL (Stubbs, 2019). All these issues must be assessed through a systematic process that measures the adequacy of the organization's use of resources and of the implemented actions to improve TBL balance (Montiel & Delgado-Ceballos, 2014).

Finally, it is through reporting that organizations disclose their intentions, progresses, results, and future perspectives (Maas, Schaltegger, & Crutzen, 2016). Organizations worldwide are increasingly including in sustainability reports information regarding their contribution to the SDGs (Fonseca & Carvalho, 2019; Poddar et al., 2019; Rosati & Faria, 2019). However, this practice of publicly disclosing information on how an organization is addressing the SDGs is still limited to larger organizations (Rosati & Faria, 2019), to organizations with a higher environmental footprint (Poddar et al., 2019), and to organizations with higher commitment to sustainability frameworks, like the UN Global Compact (Fonseca &

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

Carvalho, 2019; Rosati & Faria, 2019). As can be noted, the progress towards sustainability is not simple. It is recognized by specialists that the change from a conventional style to a sustainability approach causes several organizational transformations, some of them having profound implications. These transformations are influenced by diverse barriers, drivers, and internal and external key factors that will determine the success or failure of the organizational transition to a sustainability-oriented pathway (Asswad, Hake, & Marx Gómez, 2016).

Pain reinforces this idea by acknowledging that most of the approaches and organizational models were not able to lead to a systemic thinking of integrative actions towards sustainability, due, at least in part, to the inability of organizational thinking to integrate and balance sustainability dimensions (Pain, 2014). Other studies refer the non-existence of a single integration model that allows organizations to implement sustainability practices in their daily activities and in their medium and long-term strategies, using simple and conventional management procedures (Maas et al., 2016; Morioka & de Carvalho, 2016; Rosati & Faria, 2019).

The study described in this paper was based on a qualitative exploratory research, combining different perspectives found in a structured literature review, and aims to explore a differentiating approach regarding the dynamization and integration of sustainability in organizational context. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to propose methodologies to drive organizations towards the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools in order to materialize their intentions regarding sustainability issues. For this, a framework for sustainability management will be developed, designated as Integrative Sustainable Intelligence (ISI). This framework is expected to provide organizational managers with a structural model that leads to a logical pathway between the development, implementation, assessment, and correction of sustainability-oriented activities.

The main contributions of this research are the following: (a) the development of the ISI framework; (b) the development of a simple approach, structured in functional steps, which allows managers to question the pathway towards organizational sustainability; (c) the understanding of sustainability through a holistic and transversal approach, which is expected to help organizations in the strategic decision-making process regarding the operationalization of CS.

Also, the development of the ISI model, presented in this paper, is expected to provide a theoretical contribution to the subject of organizational sustainability management, enhancing future empirical research projects focusing this model's impacts and relevance and thus contributing to its continuous refinement.

# BACKGROUND

The acknowledgement that the present trends regarding production and consumption are unbearable is patent in several scenarios (Costanza et al., 2014) and has led to the understanding of the importance and irreparability of functions and values that are being lost in the natural and social environments, many of which are critical for the adequate operation and balance of different systems.

Some signs are promising counteracts of the present degradation, namely, planet's decarbonization initiatives (Rockström et al., 2017), the UN agenda for SD (UN, 2015), and the clear pressure that stakeholders are exerting on the activities of organizations (Govindan, 2018).

All these reasons motivate organizations to dedicate more attention to the mitigation of negative impacts caused by their activities (Michelon, Boesso, & Kumar, 2013). Nevertheless, it is recognized that there are difficulties in adequately operationalizing organizational sustainability into activities that can be understandable, functional, and quantified (Kyaw, Olugbode, & Petracci, 2017; Lankoski, 2016). This leads organizations to invest in sustainability by mere institutional reaction to stakeholder pressures, without an adequate intelligence approach. Therefore, the actions and behaviours triggered are frequently unrelated with the impacts that should be addressed (Porter & Kramer, 2006) and compromise the effectiveness of innovative actions and opportunities, as well as competitive advantages and value co-creation (Aquilani, Silvestri, Ioppolo, & Ruggieri, 2018).

More important than understanding the impact of sustainability factors, the major challenge faced by organizations, of any size and activity sector, is the lack of transversal knowledge regarding the impacts of their activities, which would allow the adequate understanding of how to integrate sustainability in their daily practices (Shields & Shelleman, 2015). The results of Kiron et al., obtained in a research study focusing large companies, show that 90% of executives perceive sustainability as something important, but only 60% were able to identify sustainability strategies (Kiron et al., 2017).

Many strategies were developed with the aim to overcome this gap between sustainability intentions and sustainability practices, as referred by Bonini and Bové (2014), for example, extension of the scope of products life cycle, organizational strategy focused on sustainability, encouragement of open, honest, and transparent internal dialogues regarding sustainability efforts, support given to innovation, creativity, and initiative regarding sustainability issues (Bonini & Bové, 2014). In this scope, the voluntary implementation of integrated management systems (e.g., quality management, environmental management, and health and safety management) can be a relevant contribution to enhance sustainability-oriented practices. Several research studies have established a connection between the implementation of management systems and improvements in organizational sustainability (e.g., Qi, 2013; Gianni, Gotzamani, & Tsiotras, 2017; Testa, Boiral, & Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2018; Para-González & Mascaraque-Ramírez, 2019) because they share the focus on the relationship with different stakeholders — clients, competitors, and suppliers (quality management), communities and ecosystems (environmental management), and employees (health and safety management). Several authors agree that the integration of sustainability in organizations daily practices is imperative for its adequate development, namely, because of the following: (a) it improves competitivity and general well-being (Scherrer, Daub, & Burger, 2007); (b) it appeals to a holistic vision of the different sustainability dimensions (Lozano, 2015); (c) it allows the typifying of organizations actions and activities (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, & Leal Filho, 2016); (d) it is a relevant part of organizational strategic planning (Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017); and (e) it acts as a conceptual structure in the decision-making processes (Bonn & Fisher, 2011).

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

Engert, Rauter, and Baumgartner (2016) refer that the proposals developed regarding sustainability integration processes only focus very specific questions, and in spite of the growing interest on these issues, theoretical contributions do not comprise intuitive approaches with practical implementation tools. These authors appeal that “future research should move from focusing on whether or not companies need to integrate corporate sustainability into strategic management to how this could be done in practice” (Engert et al., 2016; p. 2843).

In this scope, the model developed by Mass et al. (2016) must be referred: It considers three factors based on the quantification, management, and communication, through inside-out/outside-in perspectives of analysis (Maas et al., 2016). Another relevant contribution is the model developed by Morioka and de Carvalho (2016), based on organization's performance and considering four factors: processes and practices, skills, proposals, and contributions for the development of competitive advantages (Morioka & de Carvalho, 2016).

A possible explanation regarding why organizational sustainability models do not define the operationalization of sustainability integration is the implicit complexity of its implementation. In order to successfully integrate sustainability in its daily practices, an organization must perform a deep reflection regarding the conception of sustainability that is more suited with its organizational culture, which will have to be reflected on its strategic and operative sustainability management (Lankoski, 2016).

Ortiz-Avram et al. state the need of research studies aiming to increase knowledge and consolidate the notion of integrated sustainability (IS) focusing (a) connections and ethical values, (b) performance in the long term, (c) formal processes to develop IS, and (d) good-practice policies (Ortiz-Avram, Domnanovich, Kronenberg, & Scholz, 2018).

Several authors agree that the necessary change regarding sustainability integration processes is provided by transformation skills resulting from organizational culture (Linnenluecke & Griffiths, 2010), because it is this organizational culture that enables the consolidation and understanding of organizational sustainability goals.

On the other hand, it is recognized that different factors can motivate organizational changing processes and enable the understanding of how organizations integrate and promote interactions of sustainability issues in the different TBL dimensions. The organizational impacts of these factors vary whether they are internal or external, specific or transversal (Lozano, 2015). Examples of internal factors commonly refer leadership, strategies, culture, environmental precaution, risk mitigation, and transparency; as external factors, it is common to see negative publicity, stakeholders pressures, regulations and legislation, and the rising of general social awareness (Lozano & von Haartman, 2018). All these factors are dynamic and depend on the organization's size, structure, and activity sector (Engert & Baumgartner, 2016).

For organizations that have successfully IS issues, sustainability management demands the verification of the scope and impact of organizational changes, as well as the assessment of how the organization is effectively handling its processes and interacting with relevant stakeholders (Doppelt, 2010). For these purposes, it is important to identify not only key internal or external factors but also transversal key factors, common to other organizations. This allows the contextual understanding of possible interactivities between awareness, implementation, measurement, and communication processes, promoting facilitating activities in order to overcome sustainability barriers.

Previous research on these issues highlights the need to develop management models with ability to integrate CS and therefore to enable value co-creation dynamics (Aquilani et al., 2018). The lack of sustainability intelligence leads to reactive and mechanical responses to stakeholder pressures. The absence of a critical and strategical analysis of possible approaches increases the risk of uncertainties regarding possible actions to implement, which hinder the effective integration of sustainability and its associated benefits. Consequently, organizational impact of sustainability-oriented actions is not recognized as “expansion of wealth-welfare-well-being all around” by adopting a “win more–win more” approach, as referred by (Ramaswamy & Ozcan, 2014; p. 31).

Based on literature, the present research assumes organizations as non-homogeneous entities, characterized and differentiated by specific dynamics. Their understanding and operationalization of the ISI will define a framework that reflects their perception degree on different factors.

# 2.1 Business models for sustainability

The study of business models has an increasing relevance in CS management. Business models provide a systematic analysis and perspective on how an organization operates and does its businesses, enabling the adequate delineation, observation, implementation, and modification of practices and procedures in different strategic and operational stages (Zott, Amit et al. 2011; Muñoz-Torres, Fernández-Izquierdo, Rivera-Lirio, & Escrig-Olmedo, 2019).

Business models can be defined as “value propositions” that an organization presents to its customers, reflecting the methodologies used to manage its resources in order to create and sustain value over time (Muñoz-Torres et al., 2019).

Literature review shows different approaches and typologies regarding business models, applied to different sectors and economic activities. However, the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions in the study of business models has only taken place recently (Geissdoerfer, Vladimirova, & Evans, 2018).

The adoption and transformation of business models in the context of organizational sustainability depend on the organization's objectives regarding the TBL dimensions (Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund, & Hansen, 2016). Organizations have different value propositions with different levels of objectives, which implies the existence of different structural business models (Demil & Lecocq, 2010). Therefore, business models must be aligned with the global strategic objectives defined by the organization.

Sustainable business models should be considered under the scope of a dynamic and permanent interaction system requiring the intervention of multiple stakeholders and the use of diverse resources to develop and provide products and services, taking into account the adequate balance and equity of the TBL dimensions (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011).

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

The context in which organizations operate is not stable, with frequent changes and uncertainties that cannot be completely controlled (Ragsdell, 2000). Organizations promote initiatives involving autonomous measures, promoting synergies and/or complementarities, which will lead to different results and impacts depending on the specific issues under consideration (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, Amaro, & Leal Filho, 2015). This indicates that there is no unique or best answer regarding CS but rather a converging view to a given outcome (Rauter, Jonker, & Baumgartner, 2017).

The focus nowadays is not the product itself but rather a whole set of functional services associated with it, composing its life cycle. The organizational understanding of this cycle (including its economic, environmental, and social impacts) inevitably conditions stakeholder perceptions regarding value propositions, value creation, and value capture and is essential for the adequate organizational orientation towards sustainability.

# 3 | METHODOLOGY

This study was based on exploratory qualitative research methodology, which is adequate for the development of new explanations regarding how different factors relate with each other, enhancing new approaches and theories regarding a specific segment of reality (Creswell, 2003; Reiter, 2017).

The research study was planned and structured in two stages: literature review on different constructs related with CS management, through systematic and reproducible procedures (Littell, Corcoran, & Pillai, 2008) and the use of the grounded theory (GT) for the generation of new theoretical insights (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). These methodological processes are illustrated in Figure 2.

# 3.1 | Literature review

A structured literature review was performed in two different steps: (a) planning and (b) optimization (Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). It started with an exploratory search for articles on the Thomson Reuters, Web of Science and Elsevier Scopus databases, published between 2008 and 2019, focusing the topics TBL, sustainability integration, CS, intelligence, and value co-creation. A total of 570 papers were found, which were divided in different categories in order to enable the perception of the initial scope of the research field (Creswell, 2003). A refinement selection was then performed, excluding those articles that did not focus directly the research topic. A total of 120 papers remained at this stage, focusing the integration of organizational sustainability and organizational sustainability practices. These papers were then subject to content analysis (Berg, 2009) in order to provide data to feed the GT methodology.

# 3.2 | Grounded theory

GT is a methodology developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss regarding qualitative research, explicitly focused on the generation of new theoretical insights based on systematic strategic processes of information collection and analysis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). By the identification of causal connections in specific contexts, GT enhances non-linear integral approaches to understand the multifaceted dynamics of complex systems (Charmaz, 2006).

GT was developed as a response to the gap existing between theoretical and qualitative empirical research, given the predominance of quantitative methodologies in social science studies (Gibbons et al., 1994; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Jupp, 2006). Through GT, it is possible to use exploratory research in the development of models aiming to study different social contexts, even if the researcher has little control over the studied phenomena. GT emphasizes strategic approaches in the development and construction of theory from data (Foley & Timonen, 2015; Jupp, 2006).

In qualitative data analysis, Glaser and Strauss (1967) refer that the phenomenon can be explained through an inductive approach, a deductive approach, or a combination of both. Deductive research is based on the absence of predetermined theories to guide information and data collection. Inductive research is associated with interpretative approaches, allowing the researcher to use subjective reasoning based on real experiences (Ridenour & Newman, 2008).

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

Strauss (1967), research can generate either formal or substantive theories. Formal theory is developed in a broad scope research area, whereas substantive theory provides interpretation to a delimited problem in a particular area (Charmaz, 2006).

The present research study develops its research objectives through formal theory. GT will be used to explore how predictive management can enhance IS solutions leading to more sustainable business models. Based on contributions that enhance the dynamics and causal connections between sustainability and its integration in business plans, information gathered in the literature review will be used to develop an integrated, delimited, and universal theory regarding the research problem, giving analytic/inductive support to the research. GT methodology enhances the understanding of the meaning of data in several circumstances and therefore uses evidence to propose concepts by studying and examining information through successive levels of analysis (Charmaz, 2006). The concept this research aims to propose is a framework focusing organizational sustainability management, designated as ISI, described in the following sections.

# 4 | INTEGRATIVE SUSTAINABLE INTELLIGENCE

Corley and Gioia identified two requirements to achieve a theoretical contribution: originality, obtained by exercising a different point of view and usefulness, obtained by contributing to a broader understanding of the research subject (Corley & Gioia, 2011). The framework ISI proposes an alternative management model for CS, which complies with both requirements referred above: It provides new dynamics and understanding regarding organizational change through the adaptation of alternatives and considers different requirements and methodologies to foster the transition to a sustainability-oriented model. The usefulness of this framework is obtained through the development of a new concept that contributes in practice for the understanding and enhancement of organizational transition for sustainable management models.

The transition from economic models, focused on profit maximization, to models aiming the conciliation of economic, social, and environmental values, can be achieved either through small evolutive changes and/or radical change processes (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). Changes represent opportunities, which must be anticipated, prepared, and managed. Ignoring the need to implement the required changes implies not responding to new challenges and opportunities, with consequent losses at the economic, social, and environmental levels. ISI framework, described in the following sections, aims to contribute with a new insight regarding organizational change in the transition towards sustainability.

commitments, and behaviours. This adaptation should be based on a set of transversal or specific factors that produce the necessary information to adequately manage the planned sustainability dimensions.

“Integrative” is understood as the capacity to align different operational and functional factors to enable the connection needed to achieve the intended organizational goal, which will define the extension and scope of the integration required (Iraldo, Testa, & Frey, 2009; Oertwig et al., 2017).

“Organizational sustainability” is understood as the search for ideal dynamic states regarding TBL dimensions, based on the principles of precaution, interdependency and connections, efficiency and assessment, and integrity and equity. This search enables the development of skills that will enhance organizational evolution to new levels of assurance, balance, and healthy maintenance of the different systems and subsystems relevant for CS (Costanza & Daly, 1992; Jerónimo Silvestre et al., 2014; Lamberton, 2005).

“Intelligence” is based on the concept developed by Moratis and Melissem (Moratis & Melissen, 2019) consisting of three different levels: (a) naive intelligence, (b) native intelligence, and (c) narrative intelligence. This concept is complemented with the approach of Daniel Goleman that defends different patterns of intelligence directly related with self-conscience, impulse control, persistence, enthusiasm, empathy, self-motivation, and social skills (Goleman, 1995).

Therefore, “intelligence” is understood as the capacity to learn from experience and to provide rational, emotional, social, and ecologic responses in the scope of the present context and environment (Goleman, 2010; Moratis & Melissen, 2019).

In this sense, ISI translates the ability of organizations and stakeholders to apply knowledge and experience in the contexts affected by organizational impacts, enhancing alternative proposals, solutions, and proactive behaviours. These are expected to contribute to global sustainability, considering both the perspective of supply and demand/consumption.

# 4.2 | ISI framework development

ISI framework aims to allow its users to create and develop alternatives regarding the management of uncertainties in sustainability-oriented measures, enabling the implementation of adequate control systems regarding input and output variables and indicators. ISI is expected to provide a structured, dynamic, and integrated contribution for the organizational management of alternatives regarding the achievement of a rational functional change in the scope of CS, enhancing creative converging solutions. Figure 3 shows the ISI framework structured in four phases: (a) discover; (b) create and add value; (c) value co-creation; and (d) act and consolidate. All these phases are flexible and complement each other.

# 4.1 | Model conceptualization

# 4.2.1 | Discover

ISI is defined as the material, technical, managerial, and leadership skills that an organization requires, in each moment, regarding the adaptation of its resources, emotions, motivations, expectations, knowledge required to clarify a given situation or problem, which is...

# Integrative Sustainable Intelligence framework

meant to be solved or anticipated. Time spent in this stage is directly related with the required level of precision, the scope of the problem and its complexity level, the extent of the objectives, and its expected impacts. Two stages compose the “discover” phase: data and acknowledgement.

# Data

Data are knowledge, defined as the set of structured, unstructured, and semistructured information obtained from heterogeneous sources (Sherman, 2015). In data analysis processes, the “What, Why, When, and How” set of questions is crucial to enable value creation, given its contribution to adequately understand the reality and context of the situation/problem under analysis (Verhoef, Kooge, & Walk, 2016).

The collected information should represent knowledge, should be materially important and should contribute to the understanding of the problem. On the other hand, it should enable the definition of solutions regarding the adequate procedures and behaviours that will enable the delivery of the right products and services, to the right client, on the right time and at the right amount, causing the least possible negative impact and promoting the highest possible positive impact. All these dimensions should be integrated in a business model that enables the re-assessment of procedures, behaviours, products and services, according to individual, social, environmental and economic needs, with the aim of sustainable value creation.

# Acknowledgement

In the search for maintaining competitive and resilient processes, it is critical for organizations to adequately deal with and understand the available information, given the constant evolution and volatility of conditions and the unpredictability of the contexts in which they act.

In this scope, it is consensual among specialists that organizations need to develop and create skills and mechanisms for fast adaptation, flexibility and innovation, in order to timely recognize and adapt to a changing context (Kok & Driessen, 2012). Possible negative impacts and consequences will be reduced if organizations adequately and timely identify the need to implement changes.

Klarner, Probst, and Soparnot (2008) define organizational change capacity as “an organization's ability to develop and implement appropriate organizational changes to constantly adapt to its environment” (Klarner et al., 2008; p. 58). According to these authors, change is not an isolated event because multiple changes occur over time. Therefore, change capacity is a “dynamic capability” that comprises not only the organizational process of continuous learning and adjustment but also the organizational capacity to implement the necessary changes (Klarner et al., 2008).

In this step of the ISI framework, the knowledge obtained through data collection and analysis is expected to enhance the generation of ideas and proposals regarding the recognition of problems to be solved, calling upon internal and external stakeholders. The generation of ideas is developed through design and dynamic thinking processes and solution proposals should flow naturally without categorization. The scope of the problem will enhance the survival of the proposals with the highest degrees of consistency and potential, which will be naturally encouraged. The solidity of the selected proposals will depend on the predefined criteria of acceptance and of the incremental dynamics created for the required change. This dynamics will depend on stakeholders behaviours and also on organizational leadership, governance and culture (Judge, Naoumova, & Douglas, 2009). At the end of this phase, several solutions should be under consideration for the next steps.

# 4.2.2 | Create and add value

It is consensual that organizations have the core purpose of creating value. As referred by the International Integrated Reporting Council, “value created by an organization over time manifests itself in increases, decreases or transformations of the capitals caused by the organization's business activities and outputs” (International Integrated Reporting Council, 2013; p. 10). A central issue in discussions regarding value creation is the context in which value is created: time, place and stakeholders involved will be determinant for the effective understanding of value creation (Vargo, Maglio, & Akaka, 2008). There are many possible definitions of value, including value-in-use and value-in-exchange (Vargo, Maglio et al. 2008), and no consensus exists regarding the effective contribution of the different value-creation components.

In this phase of ISI model, organizations are expected to understand their responsibility regarding the need to create value in different contexts of social and environmental capitals, without questioning the dynamics of the economic value. The organization's understanding regarding these issues will result either in the expansion or in the reduction of efforts and investments in the different dimensions of organizational value. Adequate organizational capacity to create materially responsible value in these dimensions is of major importance because it will impact all stakeholders.

# Develop

The proposals and new ideas identified in the previous stages must be analysed, and decisions must be taken regarding the viability of their implementation. The purpose is to draw and develop a model allowing the materialization of the proposals under analysis, including the definition of priorities, the identification of necessary and available resources and the understanding of all implications associated with the proposal's implementation. The need for modification in case of new insights (e.g., new information or new technological options) should also be considered.

This process is expected to enhance the development of a possible solution for the problem under analysis, through a functional and iterative process that should be adequately planned, assessed and whenever necessary, readjusted, in order to broaden value creation opportunities.

A critical factor in this “develop” stage is the adequate promotion of interactions that will foster the transformation of intangible experiences into tangible ones. This can affect channel selection processes, with potential market implications, enhancing innovation procedures and improvements in organizational efficacy and resulting in organizational differentiation and improved competitiveness.

# Transform

This stage is expected to promote change through the synergistic effects of the adaptability and learning capacities enhanced in the previous stages. These new organizational skills will stimulate new behaviours. It is expected that the development of new solutions, materialized in innovative behaviours, products, and services, will provide answers to specific problems and market needs.

Those who are responsible for organizational strategy should be able to recognize their limitations regarding the knowledge of all the answers to the different problems. Two approaches can be used to overcome this limitation: one directly connected with organizational operations, considering employee motivation, participation and recognition — social capital — specially focusing those who are in the middle or bottom of the organizational pyramid (sustainability operatives); another approach is to foster the participation of a broad scope of stakeholders in the search for answers, enabling the continuous collection of ideas, opinions and suggestions, which will enhance alternative solutions to both specific and more generalized problems. This plural approach should be seen as an intangible asset in the search for solutions (Freeman, Harrison, Wicks, Parmar, & Colle, 2010).

The transformation process should be structuralist, multi-dimensional and multidirectional and should promote organizational transformations at different levels — including systems, procedures and behaviours — transferring its actions to different contexts and stakeholders. This process must consider historical and contextual considerations that underlie transformations, such as technological changes in products and services that have shaped social, economic and environmental habits and contexts over time.

This organizational transformative vision is expected to create the basis for new scenarios and forecasts. This will enable the development and implementation of visionary strategies to change future habits and practices.

# 4.2.3 | Value co-creation

The “value co-creation” stage aims the management of the planned change through a participative process, in which the organization and its stakeholders are included and through which knowledge is generated and transferred. Because the value incorporated in a product or service is defined by its use (value-in-use) and not by its cost (value-in-exchange), the determination of the incorporated value is up to the final user (Vargo & Lusch, 2008).

As referred by Saarijärvi et al. (2013), it is crucial to adequately identify and understand “what kind of value is cocreated for whom, using what resources, and through what mechanism” Saarijärvi, Kannan & Kuusela, 2013. The amount of value co-created, as well as its perception, depends on the specific circumstances and actors present in this interaction, namely, the organization, its clients, business partners and society. This interaction may occur in different forms: business to consumer, business to business, business to governance or business to employee.

and enhance innovative performances throughout the organization. This stage of the ISI framework deals with the interactivity of the knowledge generated in the scope of the new ideas and interactions impacting and influencing the surrounding environments.

with stakeholders, achieved in the previous stages. The established interchange is a semiotic relationship between the form and the content of the solutions to be implemented. This transfer is materialized through information interchange and knowledge communication between the organization and its internal and external stakeholders (Agle, Donaldson, & Freeman, 2008). The desired effect is the production of impacts between the different actors, which can be either positive or negative, and will vary in intensity and direction.

The transfer process is characterized by a high level of complexity regarding interactivity promotion either inside the organization and between the organization and its surrounding environments (Minbaeva, 2007; Spraggon & Bodolica, 2012). This is mostly given to the non-linearity of the relationship process established between the understanding and acknowledgement of the positive and negative consequences and of the strategic position that the organization should adopt in face of this problem to effectively and efficiently achieve the aimed impact.

# II. Synergistic solutions:

This option will enhance higher collective performance levels when compared with individual actions. Therefore, the adoption of solutions with multiple associated factors will result in improved impacts in the process of problem solving.

# III. Complementarity solutions:

The different solutions have a supportive effect and will complement each other in the contribution to problem solving.

# Anticipate

organization, as knowledge holder and the stakeholders, as knowledge users (Wood, 2010). The knowledge transfer process will therefore condition the stakeholder's use of this knowledge. Knowledge transfer is achieved through the use of relational networks established between all interacting parts in this process that share culture, history, language, political and social institutions (Beck, 2002). Antecipatory actions like imagining, designing, modeling, and simulating, are demonstrations of attempts to conquer a favorable position in the face of a not yet present condition that is called “future.”

Organizations are recognized to live and compete in a world with economic, social, and environmental interconnections and therefore have difficulties in independently resisting, or trying to resist, to unexpected events although maintaining a competitive position. The capacity to resist and respond to external and internal events and recover from them is called “resilience” (Rose & Krausmann, 2013). However, not all organizations are able to overcome and successfully adapt to these events, which are occurring with increasing frequency, diversification and associated challenges.

# 4.2.4 | Act and consolidate

The expression “the future is now” raises a series of questions regarding what kind of actions should be assumed and developed, which is the most adequate time frame, and what are the potential management risks and impacts in social, environmental and economic dimensions. The knowledge acquired in the previous stages is an important basis to adequately act and predict impacts and consequences.

This last phase of the ISI framework deals with the implementation of the selected actions and the assessment of their impacts, enabling the organization to assume a consolidated position in problem anticipation and solving and enhancing new discoveries and new processes.

# Solutions

In the previous stages, choices have been made, and consequently interrelations have been established between different actors, in the scope of a specific problem that needs to be solved. The results obtained lead to three possible types of solutions, with different impacts for the organization and its stakeholders:

# I. Compromise solutions (“trade-offs”):

Some factors have been compromised to favour other factors. This option requires a complete

# 5 | CONCLUSIONS

The ISI framework proposed in this research is oriented to the analysis, understanding, enhancement and implementation of proposals with impact on CS. This framework's design was based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature.

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

The main contribution of the present research was the development of a guide to how organizations can systematically understand, select, implement and assess the sustainability they want to practice, enabling a holistic approach that can lead to the solution of specific problems and prevent potential negative impacts in the future. The proposed model is based on a flexible and circular approach, that enhances organizational skills regarding sustainability-oriented problem solving.

The ISI framework aims to link the “why” arising from a specific problem with the “how” conducting to the problem's solution, enhancing change and adaptation skills. This process should be built on the creative skills of the different actors in the different stages of the solution seeking process, thus promoting the analysis of how different choices may impact organizational sustainability.

The model developed in this research can be used in a non-linear implementation process, because its different parts and stages may be individually implemented to identify and analyse specific issues, either in a preanalysis stage or in the development of action plans.

A key factor in the ISI framework is its ability to foster the exchange of collaborative ideas between different stakeholders, enhancing change processes and innovative approaches in the development of products, services and solutions oriented towards sustainability business models.

The research presented in this paper has the inherent limitation of theoretical explorative studies — it is not supported on empirical evidence, and the interpretation of information is influenced by the authors' perspective. Therefore, empirical research regarding the operationalization of the ISI framework in real-case scenarios is essential to validate this theoretical model. As future works, an empirical research is being developed with the aim to identify internal, external and transversal key factors that will contribute to success in the different stages of the ISI framework and to analyse its impacts in different scenarios. It is our expectation that this new approach regarding decision-making oriented to CS may enhance future research works aiming the continuous refinement of the proposed model and its validation through empirical research.

# Artificial intelligence in logistics and supply chain management: A primer and roadmap for research

# Abstract

The dawn of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform logistics and supply chain management radically. However, this promising innovation is met with a scholarly discourse grappling with an interplay between the promising capabilities and potential drawbacks. This conversation frequently includes dystopian forecasts of mass unemployment and detrimental repercussions concerning academic research integrity. Despite the current hype, existing research exploring the intersection between AI and the logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM) sector remains limited. Therefore, this editorial seeks to fill this void, synthesizing the potential applications of AI within the L&SCM domain alongside an analysis of the implementation challenges. In doing so, we propose a robust research framework as a primer and roadmap for future research. This will give researchers and organizations comprehensive insights and strategies to navigate the complex yet promising landscape of AI integration within the L&SCM domain.

Generative artificial intelligence (hereafter referred to as AI) is high on the Gartner hype cycle concerning logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM)-related technologies. Various AI manifestations, including robotic process automation (e.g., collaborative robots or “cobots”), techniques in computer vision, speech recognition, machine and deep learning, and natural language processing, have opened new pathways to efficiently and effectively manage complex decision making and operations (Pessot et al., 2023). Figure 1 illustrates the capabilities of existing AI applications in the business ecosystem. These cutting-edge resources can potentially develop dynamic capabilities, enabling organizations to reinvent structures, flex policies, innovate processes, and offer novel improvisations toward value creation (Richey et al., 2022). L&SCM managers now hope for exceptionally rapid data- and objective decision making (Brau et al., 2023).

However, we have all experienced this hype before, haven't we? Only a few years ago, stock prices were exploding at (soon to be) overvalued corporations claiming significant investments in blockchain technology (Gligor et al., 2022; Treiblmaier & Garaus, 2023; Treiblmaier & Rejeb, 2023). Hype-laden speculation is common in L&SCM practice and research because technology is vital to moving goods, information, finances, and people. Nevertheless, AI feels different from previous technological advancements. AI has already demonstrated varying degrees of success. Individuals—like editors—are taking immediate notice of AI's ability to accumulate “plausible” written text (Boston Consulting Group, 2023). Robots show remarkable dexterity, causing the uninitiated to reflect on some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies. All humor aside, our research question at the Journal of Business Logistics (JBL) should center on what, when, how, and why AI truly adds value. Still, AI presents a paradox as it reduces human involvement in simplifying tasks while simultaneously burdening humans with new decision-making responsibilities arising from the information it generates. Generative AI refers to integrating machine learning models to fabricate novel content. This encompasses text, audio, video, imagery, software code, and simulations based on large datasets that train the generative model (Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). This subset of AI technologies includes algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) techniques (Budhwar et al., 2023; Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). The output quality hinges on the quality of its input, considering both the training data and the prompts provided by users to define the desired task. The authenticity of responses from generative AI models such as GPT4 is constrained, given that these algorithms are “opaque” in their methodology, not illuminating how the responses were generated. There is concern about these algorithms generating spurious information, euphemistically termed “hallucinations,” and stoking considerable concerns regarding trustworthiness. This carries significant ethical and reputational risks for supply chain planning.

lost $100 billion in shares due to an inaccurate response from its AI chatbot on Twitter during a demonstration in February 2023 (Thorbecke, 2023).

The emergence of ChatGPT in the public sphere has ignited a surge of interest within the AI chatbot market (Davenport, 2023). Microsoft's announcement of a $10 billion investment in OpenAI has galvanized this trend, impelling other technology providers to join the race. Google recently unveiled an experimental service named “Bard” and “Project Magi,” aimed at revolutionizing web search experiences (Data Scientist, 2023), while Meta introduced LLaMA, a language model comprising 65 billion parameters (Meta, 2023). Similarly, Baidu launched a ChatGPT-style service named “Wenxin Yiyan” in Chinese or “Ernie Bot” in English. Additional entrants include Character.ai, an AI chatbot capable of impersonating famous individuals or fictional characters. South Korean search engine firm Naver has rolled out its own AI tool, HyperCLOVAX, which has been incorporated into its search engine and can analyze and generate text, images, videos, and audio. Similarly, in the L&SCM domain, Microsoft has unveiled a novel feature called Dynamics 365 Copilot as a part of its supply chain management platform (Microsoft Dynamics 365, 2023). The feature leverages AI to assist businesses in monitoring and reacting promptly to disruptions that might affect their supply chains. Following the identification of a possible risk, the system can automatically craft a message and send it to the concerned suppliers. Through this AI application, Microsoft aims to enhance the resilience of supply chains, promoting a more efficient and informed business operation strategy.

We anticipate that as new players continue to enter the AI market, the technology will grow more powerful and sophisticated, extending its business applications and potential business risks. In this context, integrating liquid neural networks with GPTs will allow the AI models to learn more effectively after the initial training and automatically, with minimal human interventions (Heater, 2023). Contrary to the hype surrounding generative AI systems like GPT-4, organizations face a Herculean task in training and operationalizing these systems within their existing business processes. This has profound implications for organizations planning to implement and use AI (Rese & Tränkner, 2024). The training process is labor-intensive and must align with organizational strategy. This raises issues of the type of training; there is a difference between technical mastery of an AI system and functional knowledge of the area of management or operations it is intended to facilitate.

In contrast, traditional AI methods typically exhibit a more reactive approach, utilizing data for predictions but not necessarily creating anything new. For instance, regression analysis, a form of predictive AI, can forecast demand based on historical sales and logistics data. However, it does not fabricate new scenarios or the impact of strategic supply chain alternatives. AI could predict demand and formulate a comprehensive strategy for meeting that demand, including sourcing, production, distribution, and customer service activities. It might also extend alternative strategies, providing a range of options for decision makers. AI introduces an element of creativity and the capacity to generate fresh ideas (Dwivedi, Pandey, et al., 2023). For L&SCM, this could entail devising entirely new sourcing, procurement, and inventory management strategies. It enables dynamism and responsiveness typically not associated with more traditional, rule-based AI systems.

In the dynamic ecosystem of L&SCM, the integration of AI promises a seismic shift in operational paradigms, fundamentally reshaping practices both upstream, encompassing raw material acquisition, manufacturing intricacies, and supplier relations, as well as downstream, embodying distribution strategies, customer engagement, and after-sales services (IBM, 2023). As organizations navigate this complex transformation, it becomes imperative to decipher how AI can be a catalyst for innovation without succumbing to potential pitfalls. Upstream, AI can transform supplier relationships and inventory management through predictive analytics and real-time data processing. However, this transition necessitates a robust examination of data security and privacy concerns, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. Furthermore, an over-reliance on AI algorithms might potentially eclipse human expertise, creating a delicate balance to maintain.

Simultaneously, the downstream supply chain benefits from enhanced customer experiences facilitated by AI-driven insights and personalization. However, this should be navigated with a conscientious approach to avoid potential ethical dilemmas, such as biased algorithms or misinformation, which might inadvertently arise during AI deployment (Ashok et al., 2022). Therefore, as organizations contemplate integrating AI, it is vital to foster an open and proactive approach to policy formulation and process implementation. This includes crafting well-rounded structural adjustments that capitalize on the efficiencies and innovations brought about by AI and preemptively address potential challenges, creating a resilient, ethical, and sustainable trajectory for the evolution of the L&SCM sector. This includes developing a multi-faceted strategy that engages stakeholders at all levels and encourages collaborative efforts to navigate the complex yet promising terrain that AI presents. Future research in L&SCM may look to understand how AI can transform practices both upstream and downstream, avoiding potential pitfalls that need to be considered before structural, policy, and process implementation adjustments plans are made concrete.

# APPLICATIONS: IN PURSUIT OF DR. JEKYLL

# Sourcing assessment and procurement

The application of generative AI in evaluating and choosing suppliers offers a revolutionary approach, surpassing conventional methods that typically involve manual analysis and decision making. AI's ability to swiftly scrutinize vast amounts of data from many prospective suppliers while considering a diverse range of parameters, including cost-effectiveness, product quality, reliability, operational efficiency, and sustainability, enables the generation of an optimal supplier portfolio. Furthermore, AI extends its inclusivity and equality promotion by proactively suggesting strategies to integrate minority-owned, women-owned, or veteran-owned enterprises within the supply chain. Enhanced by its text generation capacity, AI can provide in-depth descriptions of each supplier's advantages and drawbacks. Additionally, it can facilitate the creation of various negotiation tactics and contractual terms predicated on historical data and predicted supplier behavior.

# Supply chain risk mitigation

Generative AI's utility extends to the domain of risk management (e.g., political, economic, cultural, and partner), where it assists in scenario-based risk assessment by generating potential disruption models, including instances like supplier insolvency, strikes, natural calamities, pandemics, and more. Through a detailed and ongoing analysis of potential disruptions and danger points, companies can devise resilient strategies to ensure business continuity. For example, in a supply chain disruption, AI can generate viable alternatives based on several factors tied to our traditional logistics service quality metrics (Mentzer et al., 2021), thereby maintaining customer service trade-off targets. These sophisticated models can also develop contingency plans for various disruptions, incorporating all input from managerial prompts.

# Procurement and inventory accuracy

Generative AI's predictive powers facilitate more accurate demand and sales forecasts, enabling companies to schedule their orders and quantities from suppliers optimally. This allows for lean management practices, mitigating waste and amplifying resource and process efficiency. In addition to demand prediction—a traditional application of the AI model, generative AI can craft flexible inventory policies, optimizing the costs of overstocking or understocking. For instance, it can formulate strategies for just-in-time inventory management, potentially decreasing storage costs and enhancing cash flow.

# Distribution, transportation, and logistics coordination

Generative AI can formulate effective distribution strategies and logistic pathways, considering constraints and objectives, such as cost reduction, service level maximization, routing disruptions, weather conditions, and environmental considerations. Additionally, AI can develop backup plans in the event of disruptions such as traffic jams or severe weather. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of diverse, real-time data—including traffic, weather, vehicle specifications, and fuel costs—the AI can devise the most efficient transportation routes. For instance, the AI system can design a route for a delivery truck making several stops within a city that minimizes travel time or fuel usage. Furthermore, the AI can provide textual justifications for the selected routes, offering logistics managers a broader range of options and facilitating superior decision making. Given explicit constraints and stipulations as inputs, generative AI can architect ideal layouts for storage and picking activities within warehouses. Factors such as item-specific demand frequency, merchandise's physical dimensions, and various storage and handling apparatus capacities are integral to this algorithmic design.

# Customer relations

Generative AI can be leveraged as chatbots within the consumer sector to automate interaction with clientele. This involves providing bespoke updates on order statuses, estimated delivery times and addressing inquiries or grievances. The upshot is enhancing customer satisfaction, overall experience, service quality, and client retention. In this context, these intricate models can aid in creating tailored marketing and sales strategies for distinct customer demographics, products, or regions based on predictive analysis of consumer data and market trends.

# Sustainable and ethically conscious practices

By optimizing logistical routes, minimizing warehousing necessities, and bolstering resource utilization, AI can aid companies in diminishing their carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. AI can architect models to discern and evaluate the societal and environmental implications of sourcing from varied suppliers, thus aiding businesses in prioritizing fair trade and ethical sourcing practices. Moreover, these models could be deployed to strategize distribution efforts (particularly in sectors like health and food supply) to ensure adequate accessibility for underserved communities under regular conditions and during crises or disasters. For example, a corporation might employ generative AI to ensure diligent supply chain operations. The AI could scrutinize data from supplier audits, regulatory filings, and media reports to pinpoint potential compliance risks. Upon detecting a risk, such as a supplier contravening labor laws, the AI could suggest a spectrum of responses, including detailed audits, scouting alternative suppliers, or collaborating with suppliers to address the issue (Pan & Nishant, 2023).

# CHALLENGES: CONTAINING MR. HYDE

In the current L&SCM landscape, the integration of AI promises unprecedented potential for innovation and efficiency. However, it is not devoid of substantial challenges. The adoption and integration of AI within existing frameworks propel a complex array of hurdles spanning ethical considerations, data privacy, transparency, and visibility (Morgan et al., 2023), copyright issues, the lack of regulatory templates, and workforce adaptability (Budhwar et al., 2023; Dwivedi, Kshetri, et al., 2023). Moreover, the sector establishes robust strategies to safeguard against potential misuse and security breaches inherent with AI technologies and their variants, all while nurturing a synergy between human expertise and automated intelligence. As the L&SCM sector traverses this transformative journey, exploring these challenges is vital to creating a pathway that can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating the associated risks, fostering a SCM&L sector that is not only technologically advanced but also productive, resilient, and sustainable. In this context, we outline vital challenges below.

# EDITORIAL

# Training AI

Training AI applications and their variants, like Chat-GPT, presents significant challenges when integrating them into any domain, including L&SCM. These applications require vast amounts of data to function optimally, and acquiring or generating these data can be resource-intensive. While data are one of the critical ingredients to operationalize AI within any business application, organizations, especially supply chain small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) partners, usually lack robust data management processes, policies, and technical infrastructure, which can significantly impede their ability to leverage AI applications within various business operations successfully. For AI systems like ChatGPT, high-quality, diverse, and representative data are imperative to ensure that the systems can generate meaningful and insightful outputs, depending on the context of use. Any gaps, inaccuracies, or corruption in the data can lead to AI models that are ineffective or even counterproductive, producing erroneous insights or perpetuating existing biases. Furthermore, organizations may find it challenging to comply with regulatory requirements surrounding data privacy and security without established data management processes. The absence of stringent data governance exposes an organization to legal ramifications, as they may unintentionally violate laws surrounding the use and handling of data, especially personal or sensitive information. This aspect becomes increasingly critical considering the global emphasis on data protection, as seen with regulations like the GDPR in Europe, new copyright rules for AI proposed by the European Commission, and a recent landmark judgment on images created by AI not eligible for copyright protection in the USA. Moreover, an inadequate data management policy can hinder scalability and usefulness. As businesses evolve, the volume and complexity of data they handle often grow exponentially. Without structured processes to manage these data effectively, organizations might be overwhelmed and unable to leverage the full potential of AI applications, which thrive on big data environments to offer deeper insights and analysis.

# Issue of biases

The training process itself is susceptible to incorporating biases present in the training data, which can lead to biased outputs and potentially flawed decision-making processes. Media reports and academic research have highlighted numerous instances where AI systems have exhibited biased behavior. Reports have showcased AI systems displaying racial, gender, or age biases in various applications like recruitment, credit scoring, and law enforcement. This undermines the credibility and reliability of AI systems and raises serious ethical concerns. The primary reason behind the incorporation of biases in any AI model is the presence of biased data used during the training phase. These biases can occur due to various factors, including the historical data containing prejudices, lack of representation of minority groups, and the perspectives of the creators influencing the data collection process. When AI models are trained on such data, they naturally absorb these biases, influencing their decision-making process. Implications of such biases can be manifold. In the context of L&SCM, this could mean that the AI system might unjustly prioritize certain suppliers, products, or regions, possibly leading to unequal opportunities and systemic discrimination. It can also result in flawed forecasting and suboptimal decision making, significantly affecting an organization's efficiency and effectiveness.

# Operationalization

Operationalizing AI applications, especially in L&SCM, can be a complex and nuanced endeavor. AI's reinforcement learning process demands data consolidation, human expertise, and technological acumen. In reinforcement learning, a model learns to interact with an environment to achieve some goal or maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The model learns through trial and error, effectively learning the best actions to take in various states. While powerful, this approach requires considerable computational resources, and the learning process can sometimes be somewhat opaque, making it difficult to fully predict or understand the model's decisions. In the context of AI, “hallucinations” refer to instances where the model generates outputs that are not based on actual data or factual information but are fabricated or distorted by the model itself. These hallucinations can be a significant problem in L&SCM, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. In logistics management, incorrect predictions or decisions by an AI system can have substantial economic repercussions. For instance, an AI system incorrectly predicting a surge in demand for a particular product can result in overstocking, increased carrying costs, and potential obsolescence. Conversely, underestimating demand can result in stockouts, lost sales, and damaged customer relationships. In the L&SCM domain, the insights and expertise of seasoned professionals are often indispensable. These professionals can provide nuanced inputs to guide the reinforcement learning process, helping fine-tune the model to reflect real-world complexities relevant to the logistics manager.

Insights into managing supply chain disruptions, which can be incorporated into the AI system to make it more robust and adaptable (Johnson et al., 2022). Developing and maintaining an AI application requires a team with expertise in data science, machine learning, software development, and other technical areas, which is also capital-intensive and often difficult to contemplate for smaller businesses. For instance, integrating AI capabilities into a warehouse management system might require technical expertise to ensure seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure, real-time data processing capabilities, and the development of user-interfaces for end-users.

# Cyber-resilience

AI-related data breaches are a growing concern, particularly in L&SCM, where a vast amount of sensitive information is handled regularly. Data breaches can occur as a result of insufficiently secured databases or networks, which malicious actors can exploit to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, phishing schemes, targeting weak links in the supply chain, like a smaller supplier with lesser security protocols, to make their way into larger companies' databases, and poorly secured APIs (used to collect data, feed into AI model and access AI output), which can be exploited to extract data or introduce malicious code into the AI system. For example, the SolarWinds cyber-attack (2020) stood out as a significant incident not solely due to the compromise of one firm but because it initiated a far-reaching supply chain disruption impacting numerous entities, including the U.S. government. Recently, in March 2023, the developers of ChatGPT reported a technical glitch that inadvertently allowed some users to access the chat histories of others, exposing sensitive personal information, such as the last four digits of credit card numbers and their respective expiration dates.

A data breach can result in losing business opportunities, as customers and partners might choose to dissociate from a compromised organization. Following a breach, organizations must invest heavily in upgrading their security infrastructure and protocols. Organizations might face increased scrutiny from regulators, including potential audits and stricter regulatory requirements. Organizations might face legal actions from affected parties, including customers, suppliers, or shareholders. Given the increasing reliance on AI systems in supply chain and logistics management, organizations must be cognizant of the heightened risks of data breaches. Proactive measures, including securing networks, safeguarding data, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, can go a long way in protecting organizations from the significant threats posed by data breaches. However, they are resource and capital-intensive and require human skills.

# Business models and strategies

Implementing AI applications within the intricate spheres of L&SCM requires a monumental shift in the organizational frameworks and business operations. These transformations will likely influence the supply chain friendly configuration, revamp decision-making protocols, and initiate substantial shifts in the organizational structure. However, this is largely uncharted and unexplored territory, especially when considering the capabilities and limitations of AI models compared with existing AI systems. In the contemporary scenario, organizations find themselves navigating a business landscape that is dynamic, volatile, crisis-driven, uncertain, and deeply influenced by rapidly evolving technology. They are caught in a complex scenario of escalating their sustainability initiatives while advancing their digital infrastructure to retain a competitive edge. These twin imperatives necessitate a deep and thoughtful recalibration of their existing business models, urging them to innovate and evolve.

However, business model innovation is a formidable challenge for any organization. It demands substantial resources and capital and involves a level of risk, given that the returns on investment are not guaranteed and are seldom realized in the short term. For instance, a wealth of data is available on circular economy business models and cases, which can serve as a training ground for AI models. These AI systems can subsequently assist in devising robust change management strategies, a critical component in any re-engineering and innovation endeavors. However, the practical implementation of these recommendations remains a complex domain where the expertise of L&SCM professionals is indispensable. Their years of hands-on experience, deep-rooted tacit knowledge, and keen understanding of the current organizational structures will play a decisive role in evaluating the feasibility of the proposed changes.

Furthermore, we encounter a significant gap when we explore emerging concepts like regenerative business models (Koniezko et al., 2023), which build upon and extend the principles of circular economy models. In their current stage of development, AI applications might fall short in offering organizations a comprehensive blueprint to revamp existing business processes and supply chain configurations. The limited data on successful regenerative business models and cognitive barriers, such as a lack of consensus on their potential to enhance sustainable business performance, pose significant challenges.

# EDITORIAL

Moreover, suppose organizations contemplate integrating diverse business models, such as servitization and regenerative frameworks. In that case, they might find that AI models fail to offer a clear pathway for successful implementation despite being fed with abundant data. This limitation arises from a few fundamental factors: (a) AI's constrained ability to critically analyze the benefits and drawbacks of integrating two distinct business models; (b) its lack of depth in understanding the nuances of supply chain configurations, stakeholder relationships, and cultural dynamics, which is often developed through years of industry experience; (c) its limited comprehension of human cognition, organizational culture, and the multifaceted intricacies that govern business ecosystems. Therefore, while the journey toward integrating AI in restructuring business operations holds promise, it is filled with complexities and challenges that necessitate a collaborative, thoughtful, and adaptive approach.

# Workforce dynamics

The infiltration of AI applications within the L&SCM sector embodies a potent force capable of comprehensively reshaping the industry's employment dynamics. This signals a transformative shift that promises to redefine the contours of work dynamics, employment landscapes, and the nature of jobs within the sector, which has been widely discussed in the existing literature (Klumpp & Ruiner, 2022).

Goldman Sachs research indicates that approximately 300 million full-time positions globally, including two-thirds in the U.S. and Europe, face the potential of being replaced by AI (Vallance, 2023). Concurrently, recent data from the OECD suggest that AI could readily automate nearly 27% of roles in OECD nations that predominantly rely on human expertise (OECD Employment Outlook, 2023). Additionally, a separate study by the Pew Research Center revealed that one out of every five American workers occupy a position susceptible to AI substitution (Kochhar, 2023). While the influence of AI-driven digitalization on the low-skilled workforce is well documented in the existing literature (Duan et al., 2019; Dwivedi et al., 2021), recent events have underscored its growing impact on high-skilled professions that have traditionally depended on human intelligence, creativity, higher-order thinking, and tacit intuitive experience (Budhwar et al., 2023; Grennan & Michaely, 2020; The White House, 2022). Notable examples include Hollywood writers and actors striking for stricter regulations on studios' AI usage to protect human jobs and Harvard University's controversial decision to replace human teachers with an AI chatbot for coding lessons this fall. These incidents highlight the urgent need to re-evaluate and adapt to the evolving dynamics of AI in the professional landscape.

Therefore, the impact on the nature of jobs will likely be profound. Tasks that were once manual and time-consuming might soon be automated, enabling a more streamlined and efficient workflow (Loske, 2022). This automation, while boosting productivity, which is debatable, may also engender a shift in the skill sets demanded in the workplace. Employees might need to adapt by fostering skills that complement the capabilities of AI, focusing on areas where human intelligence holds a distinctive edge, such as strategic thinking, problem solving, persuasion, negotiation, and interpersonal relations.

Job replacement and displacement are likely consequential outcomes of this technological adoption. Routine tasks, particularly those that are repetitive and require minimal human intervention, are poised to be the first to be displaced. This shift can potentially disrupt existing job structures, possibly leading to the displacement of workers in specific roles. However, it is crucial to note that the emergence of AI may also lead to new job opportunities. These jobs might involve managing, maintaining, and optimizing AI systems, necessitating a workforce adept at navigating advanced technology's nuances. Simultaneously, the employment landscape within the L&SCM sector is slated to undergo significant transformations. Organizations might increasingly lean toward a workforce that can collaborate seamlessly with AI systems, fostering a symbiotic relationship that leverages the strengths of both humans and machines, that is, collaborative intelligence (Chowdhury et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2022). Organizations must proactively plan and formulate strategies considering these developments. This includes investment in training and reskilling programs, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and developing frameworks that facilitate smooth transitions and adaptations to the changing job landscapes.

As we forge ahead into this new frontier, the necessity for robust research into the legal, policy, and regulatory landscapes governing this adoption becomes paramount. In an inherently complex and globally interconnected sector, jurisdiction, compliance, and enforcement questions arise as critical areas of study.

# LEVEL 5: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL FRAMEWORKS

At its core, AI stands apart from previous technological advancements owing to its inherent ability to recommend decisions, adapt based on learning experiences, and progressively enhance interactions based on acquired knowledge (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). This evolutionary process is markedly distinct from earlier technological transitions, primarily focused on altering or replacing manual tasks with automated processes. Moreover, current AI applications like ChatGPT and Bard excel at understanding the nuances of natural language through patterns and sequences and possess a remarkable ability to comprehend and contextually generate text, offering more sophisticated and coherent responses over extended interactions.

Therefore, AI possesses an array of complex layers that redefine its integration into various sectors (Makarius et al., 2020). These complexities can be categorized into various dimensions, including cognitive aspects that relate to the capabilities and limitations of AI systems and relational facets, which encompass the several factors that come into play during the AI adoption process. Furthermore, the structural dimension encapsulates AI's extensive impact on work patterns, organizational structures, the interaction between AI and employees, and regulatory complexity, underscoring the imperative need for ethical considerations and fostering sustainable AI utilization. This transition has precipitated blurred boundaries between human roles and machine functionalities, fostering a paradigm where automated decision-making processes are increasingly intertwined with contextual complexities. Given this backdrop, it becomes apparent that the existing theoretical frameworks may fall short of capturing the depth and breadth of transformations resulting from AI in the L&SCM sector. The disruptions and evolutions caused by AI are profound and unprecedented, often bypassing the boundaries established by traditional theories.

Thus, navigating the nuanced landscape created by AI requires the development of a more sophisticated theoretical lens. This lens should be capable of comprehending the multifaceted complexities introduced by AI, offering a dynamic and adaptive blueprint to study and understand the radical shifts occurring in the L&SCM sector. As we stand on the cusp of this transformation, it is incumbent upon us to foster a theoretical approach that resonates with the dynamism and innovation due to AI, thereby facilitating a seamless integration and application of AI into the L&SCM landscape, which will lead to productivity, sustainability, and resilience.

# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L

synergizing with human expertise. The key research questions that might help with these dimensions are outlined below.

- To what extent can existing theories in the L&SCM sector comprehensively address the implications and integration of AI?
- What notable gaps and limitations are present in current theories when examining the phenomena of AI integration in the L&SCM sector, and how might these be addressed to foster a deeper understanding?
- How might synthesizing existing theories and insights from interdisciplinary studies enhance the comprehension and explanation of AI's potential impact on the L&SCM sector?
- What novel theories can or should be formulated to holistically understand the AI phenomena within the L&SCM sector, and what rationale underpins the necessity for such theoretical development?

# Methodological approaches

The research issues and agenda presented in the section above clearly suggest that the domain is complex, necessitating the use of several established and emerging methods to address the research questions mentioned earlier. In other words, a rigorous examination of the application of AI in L&SCM demands a multi- or mixed-method research approach. Below, we outline a few quantitative and qualitative methods suitable for conducting rigorous research in this domain.

Beginning with the experimental research method, it stands as a pivotal tool in evaluating the effectiveness of AI applications within a controlled environment. Researchers have the latitude to create AI system prototypes and subject them to diverse simulated conditions to gauge their performance. This could encompass tasks such as leveraging AI for demand forecasting—with generative models trained to anticipate future demand trends based on past data—or utilizing AI for route optimization to devise the most time and cost-efficient transportation routes. Furthermore, experiential research may facilitate a detailed comparison of the efficiency and efficacy of AI tools against outputs derived from traditional methods, including manual approaches. Survey-based theory testing can be employed to delve into issues surrounding the adoption and utilization of AI, especially at an individual level. In addition, methodologies such as regression analysis and time-series forecasting can be applied to scrutinize extensive datasets and further the development of predictive models. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be leveraged to empower AI systems to autonomously formulate solutions based on data analysis.

Qualitative research can complement quantitative methods, allowing for a deeper understanding through interviews and focus groups involving industry stakeholders. This method is instrumental in exploring the practical challenges and opportunities of implementing AI in logistics and supply chain management, thus guiding the AI systems to align with end-user requirements and preferences. The case study method offers a fertile ground for understanding individual or comparative scenarios, providing a rich narrative of AI deployment in various logistical contexts. For instance, case studies might explore the enhancements AI can bring to warehouse management through optimal storage and retrieval strategies. The approach is equally potent in examining the usage and impact of AI at both organizational and team levels. Additionally, grounded theory methodology can be utilized to build theories closely tied to the data accumulated during research, supporting the creation of AI systems grounded in empirical evidence.

Action research can be employed as an iterative method, promoting a cycle of planning, action, observation, and reflection, thereby aiding the development of adaptive and optimized AI systems. This approach welcomes real-time adjustments to AI systems, reflecting feedback acquired during the testing phases. Similar outcomes can be achieved through Action Design Research. By harnessing a blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods, researchers can forge a substantial understanding of the potential and constraints of AI in L&SCM, guiding the way to innovative and pragmatic solutions in this arena. The essential research questions that are relevant to methodologies for examining the impact of AI in L&SCM are outlined below:

- What are the appropriate research designs and methods to investigate the impact of AI at micro, macro, and meso levels in L&SCM?
- What methodologies can be applied to study the potential biases and inequalities introduced by the integration of AI in L&SCM?
- What are the appropriate metrics and evaluation techniques to measure the impact of AI on supply chain efficiency and productivity?

# CONCLUSION AND PAPERS IN THIS ISSUE

JBL has a long history of supporting research connected to and advancing the practice of L&SCM. While this generative AI discussion opens the door to an ongoing call for related research in L&SCM, this journal always supports technology-oriented research. The first three papers in this issue continue our 45-year tradition of examining emerging tech-based topics like Blockchain, e-fulfillment systems, and Industry 4.0 trends.

In “Exploring Blockchain for Disaster Prevention and Relief: A Comprehensive Framework Based on Industry Case Studies,” Treiblmaier and Rejeb employ a group of case studies to investigate how Blockchain solutions can be implemented in disaster prevention and relief scenarios. Examining the roles of key stakeholders, the authors illustrate firm motivations in deploying blockchain technology, listing the relevant properties and highlighting contingency factors. Findings demonstrate blockchain opportunities for streamlining information flows and augmenting stakeholder capabilities. Using L&SCM technology to save lives is a priority for our research. Expect to see growing attention to humanitarian logistics in JBL soon!

In the second paper, “Modularization of the Front-End Logistics Services in e-Fulfillment,” Yurt et al. (2023) explore the context of service modularity in customer-facing logistics for e-fulfillment. We were happy to receive this paper as we continue to call for more consumer logistics work. Expect a special topic forum in early 2024. These authors used an online survey of customers to extract data and identify clusters (multichannel shoppers, infrequent shoppers, and online fans), providing preliminary evidence on how commonality and variability aspects of service modularity optimize the number of service options and related performance levels.

Pessot et al. (2023) move up to the industry level by “Empowering supply chains with Industry 4.0 technologies to face megatrends.” They leverage focus group interviews to investigate how megatrends impact the supply chain landscape and the role of technology in supporting supply chain alignment. Five supply chain capabilities are identified as prevalent and fitting external contingencies. The study also highlights and compares the potential of I4.0 technologies and their applications in supporting specific supply chain capabilities. This is a paper that should open minds to future research ideas.

Following the first three technology-oriented articles in this issue, we continue to work to push more papers into every annual volume of JBL. There is no cap on the number of papers we will publish. If we can get 100 quality papers, we will publish 100 quality papers. The remaining five papers in this final issue are top quality and cover diverse topics, bringing us to 32 citable papers for the year.

From the world of transportation, Balthrop et al. (2023) bring us “How do trucking companies respond to announced versus unannounced safety crackdowns? The case of government inspection blitzes.” This paper embraces our ongoing call for policy research (see: Richey & Davis-Sramek, 2022a, 2022b). The authors investigate how motor carriers respond to changes in the likelihood of regulation via inspections. Using a longitudinal dataset, they find that firms with lower compliance costs and higher costs of avoiding inspections improve compliance before and during announced “blitzes.” Small firms with lower avoidance costs tend to avoid announced blitzes, whereas unannounced blitzes result in no changes in compliance or avoidance.

We also continue to call for work on last-mile delivery. The last mile is where research and reviewers are in short supply. In “You're Driving Me Crazy! How Emotions Elicited by Negative Driver Behaviors Impact Customer Outcomes in Last Mile Delivery,” Masorgo et al. (2023) run a scenario-based experiment examining—who is at the door with a package? As delivery drivers increasingly act as e-tailers' frontline employees via home deliveries, negative driver behaviors increasingly impact customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Driver affiliation is altering the magnitude of customer responses. Results show that the adverse effects of driver-inappropriate behavior on customer outcomes are mediated by anger and that the effects of driver inflexibility are mediated by sadness. Additionally, the negative effect of driver inflexibility on customer outcomes is weaker for outsourced logistics than for private fleet drivers. Driver-inappropriate behavior exhibits similar adverse effects on customer outcomes for both driver affiliations.

The final three papers examine classic strategic issues of postponement, relationship-based sourcing, and inventory substitution. These issues deserve additional attention as we move through a post-pandemic paradigm shift. In a much-needed study titled “Revisiting postponement: Boundary-crossing problems and tax implications for global supply chains of integrated solutions,” Norrman and Prataviera (2023) examine postponement decision making for global supply chains. This one-to-four case study approach explores decisions, related fiscal and legal implications, and cross-functional integration at a global high-tech enterprise. The authors detail the contextual drivers of increased postponement boundary complexity to illustrate changes in its decision making.

In “Competitive actions and supply chain relationships: How suppliers' value-diminishing actions affect buyers' procurement decisions,” Hofer et al. (2023) use econometric and panel data-based analysis to span the...

# ED¡ITO¡RIA¡L

effects of competitive actions in the context of vertical buyer–supplier relationships, explicitly examining how a supplier firm's value-diminishing competitive actions lead to subsequent reductions in the buyer's procurement allocations and how contextual factors moderate such effects. Findings show that a supplier's value-diminishing actions are associated with decreases in buyer purchases from the supplier, as well as the supplier's downstream vertical relatedness and the degree to which rival suppliers pursue value-diminishing actions moderate this effect.

Finally, Pritchard et al. (2023) examine a classic logistics problem related to fill rates and stockouts. This study is an excellent example of how even our neo-classical expectations from Deming and other JIT and lean experts are no longer generally accepted, nor should they be if we indeed are focused on the customer. In “The impact of stockout-based switching on fill rates,” the authors examine how customer substitution behavior can influence customer service measures. The authors find that item fill rate is primarily a function of the target service level of the focal item and the willingness to switch from an alternate item to the focal item. Category fill rate is influenced by the target service level of both items, with a willingness to switch amplifying their effect. However, the decision tree approach can overestimate the item fill rate when the willingness to substitute from the alternate item increases and accurately predicts category fill rates outside of scenarios with asymmetric substitutability.

We hope volume 44 of JBL has been informative and impactful. We also hope this perspective editorial helps guide future research and encourages the field to send important work to the journal. Thanks for supporting the Journal of Business Logistics.

# Abstract

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has consistently grown and is gaining widespread attention. Given the vast body of CEP–CFP studies, recently scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. However, no study so far has meta-analyzed the findings yielded by event studies assessing the stock market reactions to corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events). This paper sets out to close this gap by synthesizing previous empirical results regarding the stock market impact of positive and negative CEP-related events. Results indicate a positive relationship across studies in terms of positive market reactions to positive events and negative reactions to negative events. Furthermore, the findings show that the market reactions are stronger for negative events than for positive events (i.e., asymmetry in the stock market reaction). Finally, this study examines whether methodological artifacts (i.e., differences in the study designs) may explain the differences in the findings of the analyzed event studies.

# Introduction

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been burgeoning for years and is still expanding. A plethora of empirical studies has been examining the CEP–CFP link and the question whether it “pays to be green” continues to receive unabated attention in both general media (e.g., Diamond 2009; Elgin 2007) and scholarly publications. Moreover, corporate practitioners are increasingly faced with external pressures from different stakeholders to behave responsibly toward the natural environment (Flammer 2013). According to the latest global survey of CEOs provided by Accenture and UN Global Compact (UNGC), 93 % of the 1000 surveyed CEOs believe that sustainability will be important or “very important” to the future success of their business (UNGC and Accenture 2013).

While research rooted in neoclassical economics proposed that any discretionary efforts toward improvements of CEP would decrease profits and thus violate shareholder value maximization (e.g., Friedman 1970; Jensen 2002); other scholars have challenged this view by putting

forward arguments for a positive impact of CEP on CFP. In particular, stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Parmar et al. 2010) and the natural resource-based view (NRBV; e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provided the theoretical grounds for postulating a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, empirical examinations have long yielded mixed results, ranging from findings indicating a negative relationship (e.g., Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011), to non-significant findings (e.g., Cohen et al. 1997; Graves and Waddock 1999), up to findings suggesting a positive relationship between both focal constructs (e.g., Flammer 2013; Russo and Fouts 1997).

Due to the substantial body of empirical work concerned with the CEP–CFP link, scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. Three meta-analyses have recently addressed the relationship between CEP and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014).1 In essence, the meta-analytic results suggest a modest positive relationship which, however, appears to be quite complex and subject to several moderation effects arising for example from different measurement approaches, causal ambiguity, and methodological issues (Endrikat et al., 2014). Broadly, empirical research has used three different types of methodologies for examining the CEP–CFP relationship: (1) portfolio analyses comparing the financial performance of model portfolios of firms with high CEP and low CEP, (2) multivariate analyses using multiple regression approaches or structural equation models, and (3) event studies assessing the stock market impact of positive or negative corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events) (de Haan et al. 2012; Salzmann et al. 2005). The event study methodology appears particularly appropriate for examining the CEP–CFP relationship due to several reasons; for example, by focusing on stock market returns, event studies imply a forward-looking perspective on the financial consequences of CEP. Moreover, event studies evade the issue of endogeneity and are quite unambiguous with regard to the causal direction of the relationship. However, while the results of studies based on portfolio analyses and multivariate analyses have been captured by the above-mentioned meta-analyses, thus far no attempt has been made towards an integration and consolidation of the empirical evidence provided by event studies.

1 In addition, there are several meta-analyses regarding the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP (e.g., Allouche and Laroche 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). As CEP can be considered a dimension or a component of the broader construct of CSP (e.g., Busch and Hoffmann 2011; Orlitzky et al. 2003), the CSP–CFP meta-analyses partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis.

In an effort to remedy this deficiency, this paper provides a meta-analysis that accumulates 53 effect sizes derived from 32 studies concerned with stock market reactions to CEP-related events. Meta-analysis, a tool for quantitatively synthesizing the findings across a number of studies, has become increasingly common in management research (Combs et al. 2011; Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012). Particularly in cases where inconsistent findings impede any generalizations, it has become the methodology of choice for establishing consensus (Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012).

The current study makes three contributions. First, it contributes to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by complementing the existing CEP–CFP meta-analyses and thus completing the body of cumulative evidence regarding the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, given the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytically derived significant population effect would provide a rather clear indication of an impact of CEP on CFP ruling out potential reverse causality. This is of particular importance because the direction of causality (i.e., whether causation runs from CEP to CFP or vice versa) still represents a disputed issue (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Molina-Azorín et al. 2009; Nakao et al. 2007). Second, picking up anecdotal evidence, which suggests stronger market reactions to negative events compared with positive ones, this work offers theoretical reasoning for this phenomenon and incorporates this issue in the meta-analytic investigation. Finally, by conducting exploratory moderator analyses (Geyskens et al. 2006; Kirca et al. 2012), this article examines potential moderation effects arising from methodological artifacts such as different study design and sample characteristics.

This paper is organized as follows. First, the theoretical background is presented from which the hypotheses are derived. Second, the data as well as the methodology employed are explained. The presentation of the results of the analyses follows. Finally, the findings are discussed and important implications highlighted.

# Background and Development of Hypotheses

# CEP-Related Events and the Link between CEP and CFP

The event study methodology was developed in finance (e.g., Brown and Warner 1985) and has been widely applied in management research (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Event studies examine whether there are abnormal stock price effects due to announcements of unanticipated events or changes with regard to managerial decisions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999). The crucial assumption underlying event studies refers to the efficient

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Market hypothesis, which proposes that markets are able to anticipate and correctly interpret relevant news and quickly adjust security prices (Fama 1991; Frooman 1997). While it is commonly known that stock markets are not information perfect, they are considered to work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy by continually assessing and valuing new information (Frooman 1997; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). Therefore, in cases of major events, abnormal returns (ARs) or cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) (i.e., significantly greater positive or negative returns) that accrue for the particular firm allow inferring that the event significantly influences the value of the firm (Frooman 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999).

The earliest event study examining ARs as consequence of CEP-related events, to the best knowledge of the author, was provided by Shane and Spicer (1983). They examined how the stock market reacted to releases of pollution control reports by the Council on Economic Priorities and found relatively large negative ARs especially for firms with low pollution control performance. Another prominent example is the study of Klassen and McLaughlin (1996), who analyzed the market reactions to (1) third-party announcements of environmental awards signaling superior CEP and to (2) environmental crises (e.g., oil spills) signaling weak CEP. They found significant positive returns for firms receiving an environmental award and significant negative returns for firms involved in an environmental crisis. While the majority of earlier studies focused on the US and usually examined announcements associated with pollution information, in recent times several event studies have been conducted in other institutional settings (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012) and incorporated a broader range of CEP-related events. For example, Gilley et al. (2000) provided an event study focusing on the announcement of product- and process-driven environmental initiatives. While they found no overall effect of such announcements on stock returns, the results of their study suggest differences in the market reaction with regard to the specific type of the environmental initiative announced. In particular, the stock market reacted more positively to product-driven initiatives compared to process-driven initiatives. Robinson et al. (2011) investigated how the stock market reacted to the inclusion of firms in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and found significant increases in market value for the firms being included in the index. Keele and DeHart (2011) examined the market reactions to the announcement of firms’ participation in the USEPA Climate Leaders program and found no statistically significant market reaction on the day of the announcement.

It is worth mentioning that the efficient market hypothesis is not free from criticism. In particular, behavioral finance scholars have challenged the different forms of the efficient market hypothesis (e.g., Shleifer 2000).

While the events examined by event studies are admittedly single discrete events, they signal cumulative environmental performance and future positioning to the marketplace (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). For example, an announcement of green supply chain initiatives can be considered a public signal with regard to a firm’s decision towards a proactive environmental strategy. This information is deemed to be rapidly impounded in the stock price so that a change in its value implies a change in the market assessment of a firm’s net present value and thus reflects the market’s perception of the financial impact of signaled CEP (Gilley et al. 2000; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996).

Several theoretical arguments have been put forward with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP involving different manifestations and mechanisms (Guenther and Hoppe 2014). In particular, the early literature rooted in neoclassical economics (e.g., Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958) argued that environmental activities would withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance because the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs. Furthermore, drawing on agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976), scholars suggested that managers could opportunistically employ corporate resources to engage in environmental activities that enhance their own utility at the expense of good financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2008). For instance, managers may try to justify disappointing financial outcomes by engaging in conspicuous environmental activities (Preston and O’Bannon 1997).

In contrast, other scholars have argued that CEP can have a positive impact on CFP. Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995) noted that pollution can be seen as a waste of resources and thus the reduction of a firm’s environmental footprint may also strengthen its competitiveness leading to a “win–win” situation. In particular, the NRBV (e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provides arguments for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities (both tangible and intangible), leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan 2005; Hart and Dowell 2011). Thus, proactive environmental strategies focusing on pollution prevention and environmentally sound product development may entail the development of organizational resources and capabilities and stimulate organizational learning (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Hence, improving CEP may help in attracting and retaining a higher quality workforce (Turban and Greening 1996), may foster innovativeness (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Surroca et al. 2010), and may enhance decision-making.

processes and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman and Keim 2001; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).

Along the lines of Freeman’s (1984) stakeholder theory, it has been proposed that firms’ engagement towards improving CEP can be seen as potentially instrumental in obtaining necessary resources or stakeholder support and in mitigating the likelihood of negative regulatory, legislative, or fiscal action (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Cheng et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Jones 1995). Thus, superior CEP can increase customer demand (Hart and Dowell 2011), may improve reputation (Hart 1995), can contribute towards gaining legitimacy as a “license to operate” (Porter and Kramer 2006, p. 81), may decrease financial risk (Peloza 2009), and attract financial resources from environmentally responsible investors (Consolandi et al. 2009; Heal 2005).

In sum, there are several channels and causal pathways through which CEP might positively affect CFP. Moreover, the meta-analytic results provided so far are in favor of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, while these meta-analyses did not incorporate the data provided by event studies, a meta-analytic examination of event study results would be particularly useful because event studies, despite some critical issues concerning the proper design and sound application (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999), exhibit several outstanding features.

First, focusing on stock market reactions obviates the need to analyze accounting-based measures of CFP, which may be subjected to potential manipulations due to choices regarding different accounting procedures (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; Richard et al. 2009). Moreover, while accounting-based measures of CFP are limited in that they entail a historical perspective (Hamann et al. 2013; Peloza 2009; Richard et al. 2009), stock market returns incorporate assessments of a firm’s prospective development and reflect the notion of external stakeholders, especially investors, regarding future performance (Fryxell and Barton 1990; Hamann et al. 2013). Thus, event studies imply a forward-looking view on the financial consequences of CEP. This point is of crucial importance because several potentially beneficial impacts of CEP are considered to accrue in the long term (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Peloza 2009). In addition, stock market returns also incorporate intangible assets and reputation effects (Richard et al. 2009), which are obviously relevant given the theoretically proposed mechanism linking CEP and CFP.

Another advantage of event studies for examining the CEP–CFP link is that they can rather clearly determine the direction of causality (Heal 2005). While correlation and regression-based studies in most instances cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality or endogeneity, issues that are likely to be at play in the relationship between CEP and CFP (Endrikat et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Hart and Ahuja 1996; Surroca et al. 2010); event studies reasonably allow inferring causality running from CEP to CFP.3

Furthermore, as several third variables (either of moderating or mediating nature) have been suggested to be involved in the CEP–CFP link (Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Russo and Minto 2012), it is of crucial importance to control for such factors in empirical tests in order to ensure valid and reliable results.4 In this regard, event studies “are unusually precise because companies serve as their own matched control when its stock price is compared before versus after a news announcement” (Margolis et al. 2009, pp. 13–14).

Due to the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytic overall effect calculated from event studies would provide strong evidence with regard to the question whether CEP has an impact upon CFP and if this impact is positive or negative.

In view of the preceding considerations regarding the theoretical arguments and given the results of available meta-analyses, the following hypotheses are posited:

H1a Across the body of event studies, there is a positive stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.

H1b Across the body of event studies, there is a negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events.

# Positive and Negative Events: Asymmetry in the Stock Market Reactions

There are several event studies, which have examined the stock market reactions to both positive and negative CEP-related events. Some of those studies found stronger stock market reactions (in terms of magnitude of the ARs or CARs) to negative events compared to positive events (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996; Lorraine et al. 2004). Thus, there seems to be some evidence that the market punishes firms in cases of negative CEP-related events to a greater extent than it values firms in cases of positive CEP-related events. In other words, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events appear to be asymmetric.

There may be several reasons for reverse causal links between CEP and CFP. For example, firms with superior CFP may be likely to possess slack resources that allow them to invest in environmental activities (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Waddock and Graves 1997). Furthermore, also CEP related events themselves might be a trigger for causal links from CFP to CEP. For instance, negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events in time period one may initiate corporate environmental investments leading to improved CEP in time period two. (I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point).

For example, previous empirical studies have revealed moderating effects of firm size (e.g., Sharma and Henriques 2005), innovation activities (e.g., Wagner 2010), or industry characteristics (e.g., Hull and Rothenberg 2008) and mediating effects of reputation (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997), organizational culture (e.g., Surroca et al. 2010), or firm risk (e.g., Bansal and Clelland 2004).

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Different non-exclusive explanations can be offered for this phenomenon. Psychological research, in particular research on impression formation (e.g., Anderson 1981), consistently indicates that individual impressions and judgments concerning particular events or situations are inordinately influenced by more negative information than by positive information (Baumeister et al. 2001; Skowronski and Carlston 1989). That is, humans weigh negative events more heavily than positive events (Jayachandran et al. 2013; Lankoski 2009). This pattern, denoted as negativity bias or positive–negative asymmetry effect, has been recognized and repeatedly confirmed in several research domains (Baumeister et al. 2001); for example, for the voting behavior in research in political science (e.g., Aragones 1997), for media attention in communication studies (e.g., Shoemaker et al. 1991), or for memorization processes in cognitive psychology scholarship (e.g., Robinson-Riegler and Winton 1996). In the field of economic psychology prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) it is highlighted that individual decision-making patterns imply that greater weight is accorded to costs than to gains. By means of experiments Kahneman and Tversky (1979) revealed that people care more strongly about a loss in utility than they do about a gain of equal magnitude (Soroka 2006). A study of Sen and Bhattacharya (2001) indicated that positive–negative asymmetries might also be relevant in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In particular, they found that consumers’ company evaluations were more sensitive to negative CSR information than positive information. Similarly, Lankoski (2009), drawing on data from an executive survey, showed that corporate responsibility issues that reduce negative externalities entail stronger economic impacts than those that generate positive externalities.

Another explanation has been put forward by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). They pointed to the fact that negative events such as environmental crises entail financial implications more obviously than positive CEP-related events. Thus, such events in addition to signaling poor CEP also forward information with manifested financial implications compared to positive events such as announcements of environmental awards.

Finally, preannouncement information asymmetry effects might explain asymmetric stock market reactions. Doh et al. (2010), examining the stock market reaction to the inclusion in or the deletion from the Calvert Social Index, found significant ARs for deletions from the index but no significant ARs for additions. They argued that information asymmetries prior to the announcement of additions and deletions might explain this difference. While firms with superior CSP would be likely to publicize pertinent information, firms with deteriorating CSP would tend to withhold such information. Thus, announcements of addition to, or deletion from, a social responsibility index may involve differing degrees of information novelty.

In view of these arguments, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# H2

Across the body of event studies, the stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events is stronger than the stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.

# Data and Methodology

Multiple search strategies were employed for this research to collect studies examining the market reactions to positive or negative CEP-related events. First, searches were conducted in major electronic databases (Business Source Complete, Academic Search Complete, EconLit, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) using several combinations of keywords. Second, the reference lists of the studies identified in step one were manually searched (i.e., employing an “ancestry” approach; Aguinis et al. 2011). Finally, the SSRN database was searched to find additional unpublished manuscripts.

In line with other meta-analyses aggregating the results of event studies, the statistical information provided in the studies has been used to calculate an inverse-variance weighted population r (e.g., Stahl and Voigt 2008). Consequently, to be included in the analysis the studies had to report statistics that allow the calculation of simple correlations. After excluding a number of studies that did not provide the necessary statistical information, the final sample included 32 event studies providing 53 effect sizes based on a total of 8660 observations. The studies included were published between 1990 and 2013. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the analyzed event studies.

In order to distinguish between market reactions to positive and negative CEP-related events, two separate meta-analyses were conducted. The analysis with regard to positive events was based on 27 effect sizes from 4449 observations. The analysis regarding negative events was

I conceived CEP-related events as incidents referring to environmentally friendly or environmentally harmful corporate actions or behavior. Thus, announcements of environmental regulations were not considered as events in the sense of this study.

Keywords included terms such as environment, environmental, pollution, polluting, ecology, sustainability, performance, market, return, financial, economic, and stock.

based on 26 effect sizes from 2172 observations. The population correlations (rs) were calculated by means of random effects models. Conﬁdence intervals were calculated at the 95 % level. To assess the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, Q B statistics were calculated (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Subgroup analysis was used in order to examine potential moderation effects (Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The complete samples for both positive and negative events were divided into subgroups referring to potential moderation effects and calculated separate meta-analyses for these subgroups (King et al. 2004).

First, the sample was split by distinguishing studies focusing on US firms and studies examining non-US firms. Although the majority of studies focused on US firms, scholars have recently begun to use samples drawn from other geographical regions (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012). Several factors which are likely to affect the market reactions to CEP-related events may originate from country-specific differences with regard to economic, social, legal, or political aspects. For instance, the level of a country’s economic development has been shown to determine the general degree and enforcement of environmental regulations (Dinda 2004; Grossman and Krueger 1995), which may influence the extent to which environmental issues constitute potential threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). Moreover, general attitudes concerning environmental issues that may affect investors’ reactions to CEP-related events strongly depend on national contexts (e.g., Baughn et al. 2007; Kilbourne et al. 2002).

Second, the studies were distinguished between studies examining events that occurred before the year 2000 and studies examining events that have occurred since the year 2000. Environmental issues have been gaining momentum throughout the last decades in both academic research and business practice. For example, Jermier et al. (2006) surveyed scholarly journals cataloged in the ABI/Inform Global database and observed an increase of more than 300 % in the number of publications related to the field of organizations and the natural environment from the period 1990–1994 to 2000–2004. Furthermore, from 1995 to 2012, the size of the US SRI market, measured in total.

In cases of sample periods involving years before and after the year 2000, the studies were coded according to the main emphasis of the sample period.

assets under professional management, increased by 486 % (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment 2012). Given the significantly increased relevance of environmental issues, it is likely that the stock market reactions to CEP-related events have changed since the 1990s. The year 2000 was chosen for splitting the samples because the DJSIs, the first global sustainability equity indexes, were launched in September 1999.

Third, the sample was divided according to whether the study explicitly mentioned that it accounted for confounding events or whether the study failed to do so. According to McWilliams and Siegel (1997), confounding events constitute the most critical issue with regard to the event study methodology. Confounding events are firm-specific events, other than the focal event, that occur during the event window and might have an impact on the firm’s stock price. Such events can include dividend declarations, announcements of an impending merger, signings of major contracts, announcements of new products, filings of large damage suits, announcements of unexpected earnings, or changes with regard to key executive positions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Concerns regarding confounding events can be addressed by screening for potentially confounding events and excluding the relevant observations from the analysis.

Finally, this work distinguished between effect sizes derived from ARs and effect sizes derived from CARs. ARs represent the difference between expected returns and actual returns, or in other words, returns earned by firms adjusted for the “normal” return process (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). ARs are usually measured on day zero (i.e., the date of the respective event) or on day 1 (i.e., the day following the respective event). CARs are calculated by cumulating ARs over a certain period of time, the so-called event window. Thus, CARs are assumed to measure the average effect of an event on the firm’s stock price (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). However, the use of CARs may exacerbate the problem of confounding events, especially if long event windows are used (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Furthermore, with regard to effect sizes calculated from CARs, this work distinguished between CARs calculated over the traditional 3-day event window (-1, 1) and CARs calculated over longer event windows.

A common issue regarding the meta-analytic methodology is manifested by the so-called publication bias or file-drawer problem. The file-drawer problem rests on the assumption that the decision for submitting or publishing studies is influenced by the presence or absence of statistically significant results in such a way that statistically non-significant findings are less likely to be published (Begg 1994; Dalton et al. 2012; Geyskens et al. 2009).

Consequently, meta-analytic calculations may yield upwardly biased results. To account for the file-drawer problem, I calculated the fail–safe k, which provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to make the summary effect insignificantly (Rosenthal 1979).

With regard to the other subgroup analyses, no statistically significant moderation effects were found. However, for proofing that the difference was statistically significant, I conducted an additional meta-analysis including both effect sizes for positive and negative events as separate subgroups whereby the sign of the effect sizes for negative events has been reversed. The QB indicated a significant difference (QB = 200.360, p < .01).

Some observations might be worth mentioning. First, regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions tend to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples (positive events: r = .053, 95 % CI: .001 to –.106 for US samples vs. r = .092, 95 % CI: .008 to –.175 for non-US samples, negative events: r = -.164, 95 % CI: -.230 to -.096 vs. r = -.228, 95 % CI: -.339 to -.110). Second, while the population rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000, the r regarding positive events before the year 2000 was not significant (r = .032, 95 % CI: -.054 to –.117), contrary to the r pertaining to positive events as of the year 2000 (r = .077, 95 % CI: .023 to –.131). Finally, for negative events, both the r calculated from studies which controlled for confounding events as well as the r derived from studies not accounting for this issue were significant (r = -.139, 95 % CI: -.22 to -.054 and r = -.219, 95 % CI: -.298 to -.137). For positive events, only the r calculated from studies that controlled for confounding events was significant (r = .093, 95 % CI: .030 to –.156). To some extent these partially non-significant effects regarding positive events may be a further indication that the stock market reactions to negative events are more robust and generalizable than those to positive events.

# Discussion and Conclusion

Several studies examined the market reactions to CEP-related events and yielded mixed results. In an attempt to reconcile this inconsistency, the current work accumulated the empirical evidence of 29 event studies by means of meta-analysis. This study adds to the established body of cumulative evidence concerning the CEP–CFP link as it complements the existing meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014), which did not incorporate event study findings. Overall, my results corroborate the existing meta-analytic evidence of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP by demonstrating.

J. Endrikat

that there is a positive market reaction to positive CEP-related events and a negative reaction to negative events. Moreover, due to the nature of event studies, these meta-analytically derived estimates indicate a positive causal impact of CEP on CFP. CEP-related events indeed appear to alter the market’s perception of firms’ net present values of future profits and cash flows (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). However, what is not clear from the current meta-analysis is the exact reason why CEP-related events change the stock market’s perception of future firm value. Along the lines of the NRBV and the stakeholder theory, it could be argued that CEP-related events are effective in signaling a firm’s competitive resources and capabilities and its potential effectiveness in meeting stakeholder demands. Nevertheless, which potential benefits from superior CEP and which detriments from poor CEP are in particular valued or punished by the market remains to be established.

Furthermore, the findings suggest that there is asymmetry in the stock market reactions with stronger reactions to negative than to positive CEP-related events. The asymmetry can be explained in the light of the so-called negativity bias, a pattern that may be “one of the most basic and far-reaching psychological principles” (Baumeister et al. 2001, p. 362). To this end, the findings are in line with insights from economic psychology indicating asymmetric evaluations of potential losses and gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Hence, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events might just mirror a general cognitive pattern. However, from a more specific point of view, it can be argued that negative CEP-related events such as announcements of violations of environmental laws (e.g., Karpoff et al. 1998) or toxic releases (e.g., Hamilton 1995) demonstrate poor CEP in a clear and explicit manner. Thus, negative CEP-related events appear to constitute strong and (adversely) value-relevant signals for the shareholders. Contrarily, positive CEP-related events such as announcements of green supply chain initiatives (Bose and Pal 2012) or engagement in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program (Keele and DeHart 2011) strictly speaking may just represent a firm’s efforts not necessarily implying actual superior CEP. Accordingly, positive CEP-related events might not in all cases entail information that is sufficient to alter the shareholder’s evaluation of firm value. In addition, the asymmetric stock market impacts of positive and negative CEP-related events might be explained by information asymmetries prior to the events. Superior CEP might be already factored in by the markets, as firms with superior CEP are likely to publicize pertinent information, while poor performing firms would tend to withhold such information so that the “surprise” effect is much stronger for negative events (Consolandi et al. 2009; Doh et al. 2010). Future research may expand on the asymmetry issue and explore the reasons for the asymmetric market reactions to CEP-related events in more detail.

With regard to the examination of potential moderation effects, this work only found a significant moderation effect for the length of the event windows. For negative events the population r for longer windows was significantly smaller than that for the (-1, 1) window. For positive CEP-related events only the population r for the (-1, 1) window was significant while a significant population r for longer event windows was not found. From a theoretical point of view, this finding further highlights the more material effect of negative CEP-related events compared to positive events. Negative CEP-related events appear to entail stock market reactions that are stronger and more persistent over time compared with the reactions to positive events. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, this finding provides support for the recommendations of McWilliams and Siegel (1997) to use event windows that are as short as possible. Contrary to the argument of Barnett and King (2008) proposing that the market may need some time to capture the full impact of certain events, the current findings suggest that the market is able to factor in the information revealed by CEP-related events rapidly.

However, it is worth mentioning that the length of the event window was the only statistically significant moderation effect that was detected in the current work. While the width of the confidence intervals and the significance of the Q statistics for most of the subgroups indicated that the variation of the findings of the event studies included in the analysis was above that expected by chance, the subgroups failed to capture these effects. That means, while subgroup analyses indicated the presence of moderation effects, the particular effects could not be specified.

The failure of the present meta-analysis to reveal moderation effects that would adequately explain the observed heterogeneity clearly suggests a need for further research to identify moderation effects, attributed to both methodology and theory that may explain the variation in the study findings. For example, scholars may explore whether country-specific differences may entail moderation effects regarding the stock market reactions to CEP-related events. The current meta-analysis showed that regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions seem to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples. Since several factors that are likely to influence stock market reactions to CEP-related events are dependent on country-specific institutional contexts (e.g., Bansal and Roth 2000; Baughn et al. 2007; Etzion 2007), future research exploring the national context-specific mechanisms that may account for the differences in more detail might yield important insights.

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Another interesting avenue for future research may refer to the frequently expressed notion that the market’s awareness regarding environmental issues has increased over time (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Flammer 2013). The findings of the current study point in this direction as the population r calculated across studies examining stock market reactions to positive events that occurred before the year 2000 was not significant, contrary to market reactions to positive events occurring after the year 2000. Related to this, and probably even more interesting, is the question of why the increase in market reactions to CEP-related events seems to apply only to positive events but not to negative ones. Contrary to the finding regarding positive events, the rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000. This suggests that the stock market reactions to negative events may have not been subject to changes over time, while the reaction to positive events constitute a more recent phenomenon. One potential explanation may be that the negative financial effects of poor CEP arising from reputational damages or impeding fines and remediation costs have been well established for some time, while the beneficial effects of superior CEP resulting from competitive resources or improved stakeholder relationships have only recently been taken into consideration due to an increased attention on sustainability issues.

Finally, future research could also focus on the differences with regard to the specific events examined in the event studies. In view of the fact that CEP must be considered a multidimensional construct (Trumpp et al. 2015) it is obvious that also CEP-related events address quite different aspects of CEP. Therefore, one potential reason for the variation of the study results may refer to the variety of different events such as environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996), product- and process-driven environmental initiatives (Gilley et al. 2000), inclusion and exclusion from the DJSI (Consolandi et al. 2009), or membership in voluntary environmental initiatives (Keele and DeHart 2011). While it would have been interesting to explore whether the variation of the study findings might be attributed to the qualitative differences of the particular events, the very diversity of CEP-related events and, associated therewith, the small number of sufficiently similar studies did not allow constructing meaningful subgroups for contrasting the effect sizes in this regard.

To conclude, this study adds to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by providing meta-analytic evidence for positive market reactions to positive CEP-related events and negative market reactions to negative CEP-related events. Thus, it indicates that CEP-related events affect the market’s estimates of future cash flow. Furthermore, the meta-analytic results demonstrate that the market reaction is asymmetric in that the reaction is stronger for negative events than for positive events. Finally, the analyses indicate the presence of moderation effects that could not sufficiently be explained by the subgroup analyses that were feasible on the grounds of the available data. Thus, this study entails the need for further research on this topic.

# Organizational capabilities for sustainability towards corporate sustainability benefits: a systematic literature review and an integrative framework proposal

# ABSTRACT

This research relates the theme of corporate sustainability to organizational capabilities from business strategy. The literature brings initial indications on the contribution of strategic organizational capabilities to corporate sustainability. However, these attempts are still incipient and non-structured. Thus, in order to explore different organizational capabilities that companies can develop to obtain sustainability benefits, this paper aims to propose an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits. For this, a systematic literature review was conducted, based on a paper sample of 88 publications extracted from the ISI Web of Science database. The paper also develops a descriptive overview of the subject, presenting the main gaps and a research agenda. The results showed that corporate sustainability is strongly related to business strategy and the ability of companies to develop specific capabilities. Thus, the understanding from academics and managers on what strategic organizational capabilities (OCs) consists and how they can be developed or improved is fundamental to reaching corporate sustainability. The paper presents some contributions. First, the integrative framework developed from the literature review comprises seven categories of organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCSs) related to ten categories of corporate sustainability benefits (CSBs). Second, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization to achieve a certainly expected sustainability benefit. Third, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature and those that need further research. Fourth, the overview of the literature of OCS by bibliometric and cluster analyses allowed a broad understanding of how academics have addressed these themes over the years. Finally, the research agenda developed from the literature review may broaden opportunities for further research on the subject.

# 1. Introduction

The literature has indicated that organizations that take into account the impacts of their actions on the environment and society may achieve economic returns, competitive advantage and better performance (Dangelico et al., 2017; Hofmann et al., 2012; Barnett and Salomon, 2012; Reuter et al., 2010; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

In this scenario, the logic of corporate sustainability has been gaining prominence among companies and researchers have been studying corporate sustainability from a strategic perspective, considering that organization capabilities (OCs) developed by

companies can influence it (Amui et al., 2017; Annunziata et al. 2017; Branco and Rodrigues, 2006). OC can be defined as the ability of an organization to perform tasks to achieve desired results by using its available resource base (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003; Winter, 2003; Zollo and Winter, 2002).

The first relevant studies on resources and capabilities from a strategic management perspective are found from the Resource Based View (RBV) (Barney, 2001; Wernerfelt, 1984). The RBV focuses on resources and capabilities to explain the superior performance of some companies to reach a competitive advantage. A relevant contribution of this field is related to the dynamic capabilities approach (DC), presented by Teece et al. (1997) to explain competitive advantage in dynamic markets.

However, the RBV was considered limited since it does not incorporate the external environment. The incorporation of environmental issues into this body of knowledge was pioneered by Hart (1995), who proposed the Natural Resource-Based View of the Firm (NRBV) as a more complete framework when considering the natural resources and environmental problems into RBV. According to Hart (1995), the challenges posed by the natural environment are among the most important factors in the new pattern of resource development and OCs. Hart and Dowell (2011) analyzed that the economic and social environmental challenges raised in the NRBV have multiplied over the years.

In this sense, Annunziata et al. (2017) argue that sustainability-oriented companies should identify and develop specific capabilities rooted in the organization to implement practices that are a source of competitiveness in an increasingly aware and attentive market for sustainability issues. The literature presents several studies that address the OCs related to obtaining strategic benefits for corporate sustainability. For instance, it mentions the use of proactive environmental strategies (Delmas et al., 2011; Fraj Andrés et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2007; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998), successful implementation of environmental management practices and systems (Charan and Murty, 2018; Yu and Ramanathan, 2016; Johnson, 2017), support of corporate social responsibility (Choi et al., 2019; Ramachandran, 2011; Renouard, 2011; Torugsa et al., 2012), and support to the management of the green supply chain (Bowen et al., 2001; Choi and Hwang, 2015; Paulraj, 2011; Peters et al., 2011). In this context, attention to organizational capabilities related to sustainability is essential.

However, although there is a body of knowledge on OCS, there is a recent need for more research in this area. According to Gelhard and Delft (2016), the literature has

# Journal Pre-proof

been debating about performance in facing economic, social and environmental issues. Nevertheless, the relationship between OC and sustainability benefits remains little explored. For example, Gabler, Richey and Rapp (2015) argue that little is known about how firms determine and use the appropriate resources to maximize the performance of environmental initiatives. Yu and Ramanathan (2016) comment on the need to empirically explore the development of an environmental management capability. Hofmann et al. (2012) also stated that little is known about how strategic firm-specific capabilities may facilitate the adoption of sustainability initiatives. In particular, the present research addresses Amui et al. (2017) indication towards the opportunity for studies seeking to identify the types of dynamic capabilities that can be developed in order to more effectively overcome the emerging challenges of sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also recommended how important is further research to expand organization capabilities, especially those responsible for environmental issues.

Thus, since OCS can bring strategic sustainability benefits for companies, and focusing on addressing these research gaps, this study seeks to answer the following research questions: (i) What are the main types of strategic OCS addressed in the literature? (ii) May the OCSs lead to the development of corporate sustainability benefits (CSB), and what would these benefits be? (iii) How strategic OCS and CSB can be linked together to provide an integrative framework? Therefore, this paper performs a systematic literature review (SLR) by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, we proposed an integrative framework linking strategic OCS and CSB.

This paper contributes to the academic literature in some ways. First, it advances the knowledge of OCS, since it identifies and maps several strategic sustainability benefits that can be achieved by organizations through the development of OCs. Second, although recently Amui et al. (2017) have conducted a SLR on capabilities for sustainability in order to systematize the available knowledge, identifying the current lack of research on the integration of these themes, the authors did not focus on types of OCSs, nor the relation of OCs with the benefits of corporate sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also conducted an SLR on organizational capabilities and sustainability, but their focus was on eco-innovation. Thus, this evidence demonstrates the advancement and contribution of this paper concerning the previous literature. Third, the findings may assist firms in improving their strategic OC, especially those responsible for CSB, enhancing sustainability performance consistent with the environmental and social.

changes. Finally, the paper allows a better understanding of obtaining different benefits of corporate sustainability through specific capabilities of the company, regarding the business strategy point of view.

This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, section 2 presents the research methodology. Section 3 presents a general overview on OCS literature. Section 4 presents the integrative framework that relates to OCS with CSB. Section 5 discusses the literature gaps and presents a research agenda. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusions, implications, limitations and directions for further research.

# 2. Method

The SLR can be defined as a tool to identify, evaluate and interpret available and relevant studies regarding a particular research question (Kitchenham, 2004). The SLR steps adopted in this research are adapted from Tranfield et al. (2003): review planning, conducting the review, and reporting and dissemination (Fig. 1).

This Figure also describes the main objectives, methods, and tools adopted, as well as where the results were presented in the paper.

# Step 1 - Review Planning

Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that it is necessary to carry out studies to evaluate the relevance of the subject to be researched, as well as to delimit the area of study. In this step, we sought to analyze in a preliminary and exploratory way forms by which OCS research topics are being approached by the literature. We searched Google Scholar for papers that studied OC related to sustainability. We noticed that a great number of authors studies these themes, although recently. In this step, we also analyze the main terms adopted by the articles to define the search terms (strings). In this way, an adherent search could be conducted to cover papers that approach the subject.

# Step 2 - Conducting the Review

This step comprises stages for defining the portfolio. Tranfield et al. (2003) state that the search strategy should be reported in sufficient detail to ensure that it can be replicated. A search systematization begins with the identification of search strings drawn from the scope of the study and discussions with the group involved with the review (Tranfield et al., 2003).

Thus, using the ISI Web of Knowledge (WOS) database in February/2019, two searches were carried out contemplating the theme of organizational capabilities (and related terms) and sustainability (and related terms) (Fig. 2). The WOS can be considered one of the most prestigious academic literature databases in the world (Wang and Waltman, 2015).

The first search, named "search 1", had as search strings terms related to capabilities and sustainability (and its synonyms) in order to not lose relevant content. The search was conducted by the “title” on WOS. “Search 1” was complemented by "search 2", which added other search terms considered relevant for the sustainability approach, such as “social performance” and “social responsibility”. We also performed this search by “title” on WOS. However, a low number of results were obtained. Therefore, we performed another search but replacing the search for "title" with "topic" in the terms related to sustainability. Fig. 2 summarizes these searches.

Then, we began the selection of studies. For that, some analyses were performed as recommended by Ensslin et al. (2017) and Tranfield et al. (2003), aiming at alignment.

# Journal Pre-proof

Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that only studies meeting the specified inclusion criteria should be part of the sample. The authors underscore the importance of documenting the numbers of included and excluded studies at each step of the review, providing reasons for the exclusions. At this stage, the software EndNote was used to eliminate duplicates, and read titles and summaries of articles. After completing all the steps, the final sample consisted of 88 papers, which are presented in Appendix 1.

For the data extraction stage, Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that researchers should consider the information that will be required to design summary tables and to perform data synthesis. Forms may include details on the source of information (title, authors, journals, and publication details) and any other features that could be relevant to the study. In this research, a spreadsheet was created in MS Excel, fed with information such as title, authors, year, journal, number of citations, objectives, theories, methods, gaps, research opportunities and types of OCs. It was important for assisting the analysis of the studies.

Thus, articles were analyzed by content analysis, which is a highly flexible research method widely used as a systematic and rigorous approach to analyze data obtained or generated during the study (White and Marsh, 2006). According to the authors, content analysis may have qualitative and quantitative applications, or both, as is the case of this paper.

# Step 3 - Reporting and dissemination

An appropriate SLR should make it easier to understand the research by synthesizing works (Tranfield et al., 2003). Based on quantitative and descriptive analysis, we sought to obtain an overview of the articles. Thus, we analyzed the evolution in the number of articles over the years, research methods, sustainability pillars, geographical/sectoral arrangements, industrial sectors, countries where empirical studies were developed and journals with the highest number of publications. Finally, we performed a cluster analysis on the keywords of the sample articles using VosViewer software.

In the qualitative dimension, an inductive analysis was performed. It is recommended when there are no previous studies investigating the phenomenon or when knowledge is fragmented (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). Thus, this analysis was appropriate for this research since we identified no studies seeking to identify and synthesize types of OCS.

# Journal Pre-proof

Thus, we sought to identify the different OCs and their relationship to sustainability. There was an extensive number of OCSs in the articles. We also realized that, although authors used different terms, some of such capabilities shared the same definition or were strongly related (see Table 2. General overview of OCSs categories, in Section 4.1). Therefore, it was possible to group them into categories. According to Cavanagh (1997), the creation of categories aims to provide a means of describing the phenomenon, increasing understanding and generation of knowledge.

To formulate categories through analysis of inductive content, it is necessary that the researchers interpret and decide which information should be grouped in the same category (Dey, 1993). The objective is to reduce the number of categories by grouping similar ones, or group different categories into broader categories (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). In this paper, the OCs that comprise each category do not necessarily have the same meaning but are interrelated since their definitions complement each other.

As warned by Dey (1993), the development of such categories did not occur simply by gathering similar or related information. The OCSs were deeply analyzed as belonging or not to a given category by comparing them with other OCSs that belong or not to that category. Thus, it was possible to define where each OCS was best fitted and which category needed to be formed since no OCS could be placed in a category into which it did not fit. Thus, the OCS identified during the review process were grouped into categories since they have related concepts and definitions (regarding strategic capabilities for sustainability - see Table 2). The related terms adopted by the authors' sample are described in Column 3 of Table 2, allowing an understanding of the inclusion relationship with the category in which each OCS was found.

Since the OCS categories were identified, a similar procedure was performed to identify the expected sustainability benefits related to such capabilities. In this way, we verified that the studies related to OCS sought to investigate, in a general way, whether their development led companies to obtain benefits related to corporate sustainability.

The identification procedure was similar to that used for OCS, that is, some benefits were similar or related. Thus, such benefits have also been grouped into broader categories (Table 4). Each identified benefit was related to the article from which it was extracted. Finally, from these analyses, it was possible to develop an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, as well as provide an overview on research gaps and propose a research agenda on the topic.

# 3. General overview on the literature on organization capabilities for sustainability

Fig. 3 presents the evolution of publications over the years. The first paper related to OCS was published in 1998 (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). It is a relevant research since several other authors of this sample cited it (it was the most cited - 786 citations, according to the WOS). This may be an indication that some authors have started researching on this topic from the perspective of Sharma and Vredenburg (1998).

However, the studies are scarce in the following years, with an increase in 2008. The years 2015 to 2019 (the latter year encompasses only two months) indicate that studies on this topic has been intensified, demonstrating the relevance of this theme in the current context.

The articles were published in 45 different journals. Some of these journals have as their main scope topics related to environmental issues, while others have a more general and well-diversified scope, which indicates that different areas are linking their research to the OCS issues. The most significant journal in the sample is the Journal of Cleaner Production, with 16 articles. All journals that had more than two sample articles published have a relevant Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which demonstrates the importance of publications on the subject.

Fig. 4 shows that the research methods favor practical and theoretical approaches. The survey is the most used method, and represents the only type of quantitative approach of the sample. The use of this method has increased over the years (highlighting 2017 and 2018, with the largest number of publications). Regarding theoretical articles, there is a

significant number. This corroborates the fact that it is a subject of recent research and still demands exploitation of knowledge. Most theoretical articles deal with deepening of the study topics, relations between theories, among others. Among the articles with a theoretical approach, only Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019) conducted an SLR, and none aimed to develop an integrative framework that related strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, which confirms the importance of this study.

However, there are only 13 among 88 articles using a qualitative approach (Fig. 4). Among case studies, 3 of them have a longitudinal approach. It is not explicit whether there is a tendency in using this method over time. However, from 2008, the case study has been used over the following years, which demonstrates the validity of this method within this research theme. Finally, only two papers adopted mixed methods.

# Fig. 5 shows the sustainability pillars as discussed over the years.

The environmental pillar is the strongest, and was studied mainly in isolation. However, there are articles contemplating the environmental pillar together with other pillars (social or economic, or both). The social pillar, separated from the environmental pillar, was the least explored, and only the article of Ramachandran (2011) was found. It should be noted that the economic pillar, although not used as a search string (since it is not part of the scope of this paper), is still evidenced from 2008. This is justified because many papers

Dealing with some pillar of sustainability (environmental or social) usually relate this analysis to the economic question.

In relation to the sustainability pillar, we found that most studies dealing with the environmental pillar in conjunction with other pillars still have a major focus on the environmental pillar. In this sense, most capabilities studied are related to the environmental pillar, which is why the findings of this research are focused mainly on this pillar.

# Fig. 6

Shows business arrangement where the studies were conducted. Most articles studied the context of individual firms, often identifying the industry of which the companies were a part. A low number of studies did not identify this sector. A considerable part of the works analyzed OCSs from the point of view of supply chains and, to a small extent, in the context of multinationals. The study of OCSs in the context of industrial clusters was conducted by only one research. This can be explained by Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008), who argued that most studies have examined environmental capabilities internally, leaving aside the moderating role of business environment characteristics (e.g., spillover effects) and the cooperation between organizations through clustering for the implementation of sustainable initiatives.

Some studies focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which is interesting, since there are particularities in these companies such as reduced capital, centralization of functions, among others, that hinder the development of OCSs. Deepening studies focusing on this subject are still relevant since it is still scarce.

Table 1 shows the industrial sectors in which empirical research was developed. The manufacturing sector is the most representative, followed by chemical industries, construction industry and food industry/agri-food. Although there are more studies focusing on industrial sector, the service sector, specifically hotels and resorts, comes in third place. A wide variety of sectors aside those where environmental impacts are clearer (e.g., manufacturing, chemical industry, construction and industrial wastes) were also addressed (such as technology and services). This indicates that sustainability has been receiving attention by all business sectors.

Fig. 7 shows the geographical distribution of the countries where the empirical research was carried out, with a global interest in the subject. Countries with advanced economies, such as the US, followed by the UK and Germany, have a greater number of

studies. In addition, it can be observed that most researches were conducted in developed economies. Some have been conducted in developing economies such as China and Malaysia. China is the country with the largest CO2 emissions in the world. It is often the object of study in sustainability-related studies. This fact is evident in the sample since China appears in fifth place.

Finally, among the 88 articles, few studies developed an empirical study in more than one country. Sharma et al. (2007), Judge and Elenkov (2005), Luzzini et al. (2015), Sarpin et al. (2016), Behnam et al. (2018) and Betts et al. (2018) are some examples. Since cross-country research is more difficult to perform, studies focusing on this aspect are still rare.

Lastly, Fig. 8 shows the co-occurrence of keywords over time. There is a total of 36 words with a minimum occurrence of 5 times. It is observed that the most outstanding words are “competitive advantage”, “resource-based view” and “dynamic capabilities” and these have a greater incidence in the time interval from 2014 to 2016. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the most recent themes within this subject are “firm performance”, “eco-innovation”, “market orientation” and “collaboration”. In general, it can be analyzed that the keywords are very interrelated with each other and with the area of business strategy and corporate sustainability. For example, we identified terms with different approaches to (i) performance (financial performance, business performance, environmental performance), (ii) strategy (strategic management, environmental strategy), (iii)

competitive advantage and those related terms, and, (iv) sustainability (such as green, environmental management, corporate social performance, among others).

Finally, it is important to highlight that although these are not themes that are directly related to the themes of this research, we identified the incidence of terms related to innovation (eco-innovation, product innovation, product development) and terms related to supply chains, which is indicative that these themes are close to organizational capabilities and corporate sustainability.

# 4. Integrative framework relating strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits

The present Section provides a qualitative and deep analysis of the paper’s sample. Content analysis techniques were conducted from which OCSs were identified (Section 4.2), as well as their relations to corporate sustainability (Section 4.2).

# 4.1. Organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCS)

As described in section 2, the OCSs were grouped into categories. These categories allow synthesizing the literature that addresses this research topic, thus helping in the understanding and operationalization of the constructs. Seven OCSs categories were created: capabilities related to collaborative relationships for sustainability (OCS1), capabilities related to the absorption of knowledge/learning about sustainability (OCS2), capabilities related to innovation/technology for sustainability (OCS3), capabilities related to alignment/motivation for sustainability (OCS4), capabilities related to marketing/external communication for sustainability (OCS5), capabilities related to flexibility/adaptation on sustainable issues (OCS6), and capabilities related to the management of sustainable operations (OCS7).

Table 2 presents the OCS categories, followed by a general definition assigned to each one. Since the similar and related capabilities that compose each category received different nomenclatures, the column 3 of Table 2 presents the terms of capabilities that comprise each category. Finally, column 4 presents the respective references that applied those terms.

Table 3 presents the evolution over the years of studies that addressed each of these OCSs. The studies are presented as codes (described in Appendix 1).

# 4.2. Relations between organizational capabilities and expected corporate sustainability benefits

The OCS1 are those most frequent within the analyzed paper sample (29 publications in total); OCS6 and OCS7 were those with the lowest number of papers (10 and 11 in total, respectively). It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.

It can be seen that OCS1, OCS2 and OCS3 have a larger number of articles that have studied it and are also the pioneers, being first studied in 1998 by Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) and continued to gain relevance over the years. Already COS5 is the most recent, with studies from 2011.

Since we identified the OCS categories, we extracted from the papers the expected corporate sustainability benefits related to OCS. Similar to the OCSs, such benefits have also been grouped into categories in order to synthesize knowledge and facilitate the understanding and operationalization of these constructs.

The sustainability benefits related to OCS were grouped into ten categories according to the similarity of their approaches. They are presented in the first column of Table 4 (the studies are presented as codes - see Appendix 1): support for environmental strategy/strategic proactivity (CSB1), sustainable innovation support (CSB2), support for environmental management systems/tools/practices (CSB3), improving the absorption of knowledge on sustainable issues (CSB4), support for corporate social responsibility (CSB5), green supply chain support (CSB6), improving environmental collaboration (CSB7), improving environmental adaptability (CSB8), improving green marketing (CSB9), and improving firm performance (CSB10).

The second column of Table 4 describes in detail these CSB categories and indicates how the literature relates them to the seven categories of OCSs. It can be observed that a large number of studies have addressed OCSs related to CSB10, CSB2 and CSB6. A low number of papers related to CSB8 and CSB4.

The achievement of these benefits is related to the development of different OCSs. The benefits linked to “improving firm performance” and “support for sustainable innovation” and “support the green supply chain”, for example, are linked to all the seven OCSs identified in this survey. Just as a single OCS can be tied to different benefits, such as OCS related to collaborative relationships for sustainability can bring companies nine of the ten sustainability benefits identified in the survey. This represents how important OCSs development is for companies to achieve a number of sustainability benefits.

By converging content analysis results from the seven OCS categories and the ten associated expected corporate sustainability benefits, an integrative conceptual framework emerged (Fig. 9). The framework summarizes the main findings of this research. The OCSs categories are presented along with the code of the articles that addressed them. CSBs categories are also presented along with OCS categories to which they are related, and along with the code of the article that addressed such relationships (codes are detailed in Appendix 1).

The colors demonstrate the presence of these categories in the analyzed papers. For example, the OCS categories and the CSB categories in green are the most studied by the sample's paper; the yellow has a moderate number of studies, while the red ones were categories with a greater scarcity of researches. Thus, based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature, as well as those that still need further investigation. Through the framework, it is also possible to identify articles referring to each category (OCSs and CSBs), and the relations between these categories as addressed in each of the articles, thus helping to disseminate knowledge about these topics and further the development of new research associated to these constructs.

# 5. Literature gaps and opportunities for future research

From the quantitative and qualitative analyses, it was possible to analyze the characteristics and tendencies of the articles that addressed OCSs. Thus, we identified the main gaps in the literature and, from them, we proposed opportunities for future researches in relation to method used, sustainability pillars, business arrangements, countries and relationships between OCS and CSB categories.

# Methods

Regarding the methods used (Fig. 4), qualitative approaches require more research, such as single and multiple case studies, longitudinal case studies (which appear in a small number in the sample). Salim et al. (2019) corroborate with our findings, although the authors suggested focusing on internal eco-innovation capabilities by developing action research. Longitudinal case studies are relevant since sustainable actions and results from the development of OCS can, in most cases, be better visualized and measured over time. Qualitative approaches, in spite of limitations in relation to the generalization of results, are able to make in-depth and detailed analyses of the phenomenon under study. Surveys are not able to accomplish this because they are descriptive. New research can also use mixed approaches, as also recommended by Amui et al. (2017).

The survey method was predominant (Fig. 4). Thus, future studies can use mathematical modeling, such as multicriteria tools to evaluate the maturity degree of

# Journal Pre-proof

companies in relation to OCSs and prioritize factors and sub-factors relevant to the development of OCSs, for example.

# Sustainability pillars

Upon analyzing the studies, there are opportunities for new studies relating OC to social issues, since this pillar has been studied separately from the environmental pillar only by Ramachandran (2011) (see Fig. 5). Further studies should deal with more than one pillar (environmental, social and economic), since most papers dealing with the environmental pillar along with other pillars, nevertheless, have a main focus on the environmental pillar.

# Business arrangement

Considering that OCSs were studied to a large extent in the context of individual firms (Fig. 6), the importance of developing researches in different productive arrangements is stressed, such as industrial clusters, since only Hilliard and Jacobson (2011) studied OCS using this focus. Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008) indicated that the findings on the effects external to firms on the achievement of competitive advantages based on environmental capabilities have important implications for future research in both environmental management strategy and the study of industrial agglomerations and geographic clusters. This is because clusters reveal that the business environment outside companies also plays a vital role in their performance (Porter, 1998). The cluster analysis (Fig. 8) has the same indication; that is, collaboration is a new subject, and the OCS could be studied in the context of networks.

Another alternative is related to the development of studies within the context of multinational companies, since only two studies had this focus: Chakrabarty and Wang (2012) and Pinkse et al. (2010). Such studies may produce interesting results because, depending on the location/country where the multinationals are located, comparative analyses can be done since aspects for the development of OCSs can be facilitated or made difficult by local characteristics such as culture, access to specialized labor, local development etc. OCSs can also be influenced by the location of companies. For example, in some regions, customers are more aware and more easily influenced to take sustainability issues into account in the consumption of goods and services, and pressures for environmental certifications, for example, are higher than in other regions. This can be captured and compared by studying multinationals.

# Countries

Since most of the studies carried out empirical studies in countries with advanced economies, there is an opportunity for research in developing countries and in different countries. This research opportunity was also analyzed by Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019), who both had developed SLR with research themes related to this article. Therefore, it will be possible the development of comparative analyses on how aspects of the local context, such as economy and culture, influence the development of OCSs, as well as the expected CSB.

# OCSs and expected corporate sustainability benefits

As can be seen in Table 3, research on OCS and consequently on CSB has increased over the years and can be considered quite relevant in the current context. Studies focusing on OCS6 and OCS7 are still necessary, since they received less attention by the researchers in the sample. Regarding CSBs (Table 4), several OCSs are related to the same groups of expected benefits. However, some of them are unrelated, as can be seen in the Table 4, and therefore means future research opportunities.

Finally, from the research opportunities, it was possible to elaborate Fig. 10, which synthesizes the research agenda presented here. All relationships between OCSs and CBSs that have not yet been studied are identified by arrows between the first two columns. For all proposed relationships, there are opportunities for methods (column 3), geographical contexts (column 4) and, finally, countries (column 5).

# 6. Conclusions, contributions, limitations and future research

This research systematized the available knowledge on strategic OCS. Therefore, this paper performs an SLR by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, it was possible to identify CSB from the OCS and propose an integrative framework linking both.

# 6.1. Contributions for theory and practice

This paper presents relevant contributions. The main contribution is the proposed framework (Fig. 9) that relates to OCSs (Table 2, Table 3, and Fig. 9) and CSBs (Table 4). The framework is relevant as it identifies and categorizes OCSs and CSBs that companies can acquire by developing and improving those OC. OCSs and CSBs have been studied over the years by a large number of authors, but no survey so far has been proposed to map the studies through an analysis of all existing literature. Based on this, we develop a framework that synthesizes all the OC developed by the companies (internal).

and external) and the sustainability benefits tied to those capabilities. This is the great contribution of this article.

Based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature. The OCS1 is the most relevant in the analyzed sample of articles. The OCS6 and OCS7 were the ones with the lowest number of articles, providing indications that still need further investigation. It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.

In practice, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization in order to achieve a certain expected sustainability benefit. Besides, the framework provides an overview on core aspects that can serve as basis for a comprehensive sustainability performance measurement system, providing a structured decision-making background for practitioners. This is crucial since decisions regarding sustainable issues combine a series of factors such as social responsibility issues, risks, economic issues, personal preferences and others (Maroušek et al., 2014) and according to Maroušek (2013) decision-makers of the current generation, who have more contact with academic knowledge, are more concerned with sustainability.

The second contribution is related to the overview of the studies that addressed OCS. Overall, through the overview, it was possible to identify the evolution of the research on the subject (Fig. 3), the research methods (Fig. 4), and the sustainability pillars over the years (Fig. 5). We also identified the business arrangement (Fig. 6), the industrial sector (Table 1), as well as the countries where the empirical studies were carried out (Fig. 7). Finally, a cluster analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords over time (Fig. 8) was developed.

The third contribution of this research was the presentation of a research agenda developed from the overview of the articles and the proposed framework. We concluded that various OCS and CSB still need to be identified and better explored in the literature, as well as the companies. The research agenda is important because it aids researchers by presenting several options for new studies, which allow furthering the knowledge on these themes (Fig. 10). Briefly, the research agenda shows that more qualitative and mixed research is needed, with a primary focus on the social pillar, or the three pillars together (social, environmental and economic), in the context of different productive arrangements (such as industrial clusters), multinationals companies, and in developing and different.

# 6.2. Limitations and opportunities for future research

This paper has some limitations. For example, in relation to the search and selection of articles related to the OCS, only one database was adopted. We use exclusion criteria such as conference documents and refinement by categories of research areas. This may have led to the loss of content. Thus, if other researchers refined this research using other criteria different results could be found. The research also focused on linking the OCS knowledge area with the CSBs and their results are based on this relationship. Future research can broaden the scope of OCS research using different search criteria, deepen the relationships found between OCSs and CSBs, or explore different relationships between OCSs and sustainability.

Another limitation is related to the lack of empirical validation of the developed framework. However, the relationships contemplated in the framework were developed from mapping the results from previous literature, which materializes its support. Even so, future research may validate the relations between OCS and CSB presented in the framework through empirical research, and, analyzing the practical results of this relationship.

Previous studies revealed triple bottom line cannot entirely cover the concept of corporate sustainability. This study thus uses sustainable resource management (SRM) to improve corporate sustainability (CS) performance considering the socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficacy aspects. In this study, the vague set (VS) theory and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method are integrated as a hybrid decision-making tool by which social media data can be transformed into entropy weights. The results indicate eco-efficacy and society should be prioritized to improve the corporate sustainability performance. Specifically, the aspects should be promoted through encouraging environmental innovation, redesigning consumers' offer, raising support of the institutions and policy measures, and organizing synergetic involvement. The contributions of this study are three-fold: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment data and social media information and address the interrelationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM criteria to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.

# 1. Introduction

The Chinese automobile industry has witnessed a surge growth since the 21st century. In 2007, the amount of China's automobile production had reached 8.88 million, which resulted in a net increase of 16.6 million over the previous year. In the meanwhile, automobile sales reached 8.79 million. Under the 2030 sustainable development goals agenda, the Chinese automobile industry is striving for sustainable development. The industry is seeking appropriate managerial paths to balance the economic performance, environmental benefits and social reputation under limited resources. SRM is considered as a key instrument in assisting industrial sector to achieve the CS goal when developing sustainable resource strategies. Lozano (2012) defined CS as “corporate activity seeking to achieve sustainability equilibrium, which consists of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions (i.e. triple bottom line, TBL), for today as well as throughout the time dimension while addressing the firm's systems and its stakeholders”. However, it is argued that these three pillars of TBL can neither cover the entire concept of corporate sustainability, nor sufficiently address CS issues (Bordass, 2000; Jeurissen, 2000; Wu et al., 2018). Consequently, these studies presented difficulties in precisely identifying the CS problems merely from economic, environmental and social perspectives (Wu et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019d). Furthermore, TBL was found that it existed conflicts and overlapped field among themselves (Tseng et al., 2019b). Therefore, the socio-economic, socio-environmental and eco-efficacy aspects are added as a supplementary of TBL to enrich the CS literature (Wu et al., 2019a). Therefore, this study attempts to adopt SRM practice based on the TBL dimensions with the socio-economic, socio-environmental and eco-efficacy aspects to provide precise guidelines for Chinese automobile industry.

The Chinese automobile industry also requires a valid tool to be adopted to process types of data for decision making. Previous studies mainly considered qualitative data or quantitative data to inform decision-making processes when they discussed SRM issues (Mak et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b). However, these studies ignored the critical type of data which stemmed from social media. Song et al. (2019) pointed out social media data can assist firms to avoid blind.

decision-making and provide more support and guarantees for developing SRM. Thus, this study designs a scrapping tool to collect the frequencies of keywords from social media and transfer them into corresponding entropy weights. Moreover, SRM is characterized with nonlinear, systematic feature (Song et al., 2019). Wu et al. (2019b) stated SRM possesses multiple criteria and includes several qualitative perspectives. Therefore, this study integrates VS and TOPSIS to address these problems. The novel VS-TOPSIS tool enables the transformation of experts' linguistic preference to vague set assessment matrix, as well as arranges all the obtained individual pro-t ratio matrix into the decision matrix. The ranking order can be computed to offer a specific direction for firms to utilize SRM practice to effectively and efficiently improve their CS performance.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the inter-relationship between SRM and CS and identify the decisive measures towards CS. This study provides three contributions: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment data and social media information and address the inter-relationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM practice to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. CS and SRM

The concept of CS originated from the sustainable development concept (Engert and Baumgartner, 2015; Tseng, 2017). Elkington (1997) proposed planet, people and profits to provide the operational understanding for CS within a business context. Then, Cater and Rogers (2008) formally developed the TBL structure. Afterwards, many CS studies emerged with concentration on the discussion of the economic, social and environmental aspects (Shi et al., 2017). However, the three traditional components of TBL enable insufficiently the coverage of the overall concept of CS (Esquer-Peralta, 2007; Wu et al., 2018). Wu et al. (2019b) also argued there are overlaps among the TBL dimensions, and some operational practices have encountered dilemmas when classifying the operations and actions into TBL aspects as well. Hence, socio-environmental, socio-economical and eco-efficiency aspects have been supplemented to TBL to assist decision makers in precisely distinguishing the practices (Esquer-Peralta, 2007; Wu et al., 2018). More studies these years started to discuss about these newly developed aspects. For example, Heikkurinen et al. (2019) stated companies launching extended eco-efficiency actions can move towards a more sustainable economy. Qiao et al. (2019) found disregarding the socio-environmental losses might lead to failure in the decision process for developing sustainability. Wu et al. (2019a) supposed socio-economical aspect needed to consider social and economic perspectives simultaneously.

Bringezu and Bleischwitz (2017) defined SRM as “utilizing the natural resources in rational ways and maximizing human well-being without impeding the supporting of the living eco-system.” In previous literature, several studies have noticed the importance of considering socio-economic, socio-environmental dimensions into SRM towards CS. Dong et al. (2017) noted socio-economic played a critical role in developing urban sustainability for SRM based on literature analysis. In addition, Meng and Han (2018) explored the nexus among transport infrastructure sustainability, socio-economic and socio-environmental factors, and investigated the causal relationships between the variables. Additionally, eco-efficiency is proposed as a win-win operational strategy by means of consuming fewer natural resources and reducing financial costs for companies (Wu et al., 2018; Heikkurinen et al., 2019), while the discussion of the eco-efficiency was ignored in previous SRM studies.

# 2.2. Proposed hybrid method

Previous studies adopt qualitative data or quantitative data when they address the topic under SRM. For example, Ng et al. (2019) represented a systematic framework of SRM through gathering the quantitative data from the waste and resources action program and Tesco firm. However, the qualitative data need to transform with the purpose of performing valid quantitative computation following the appropriate way. Tseng and Bui (2017) noted that some mistakes may occur during the process of translating qualitative information to quantitative forms. Furthermore, these qualitative experts' respondence always contained ambiguous and uncertain information (Tseng, 2017). Thus, vague set theory was applied in this study to transform qualitative information into quantitative data.

Although existed SRM studies aim at systematically addressing the inter-relationship among SRM attributes, these studies mainly rely on statistical models to examine the relationship based on the independence, linearity and correlation (Liu et al., 2019). Accordingly, the interdependent and exerted feedback effects cannot acquire better demonstration. Therefore, Tseng et al. (2019a) proposed a hybrid fuzzy synthetic method to assess CS performance. However, fuzzy set theory only considered positive evidence by obtaining the single membership function (Gau and Buehrer, 1993). Moreover, TOPSIS was proposed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) aiming at addressing interrelationship inside selected attributes, and it is established by the thought that the selected ideal alternatives should have a minimum geometric distance from the positive ideal consequences and maximum from the negative ideal outcomes. It is commonly recognized as an easier and fast decision-making approach on firm's level (Huang et al., 2011; Behzadian et al., 2012). Therefore, this study combines the VS theory and TOPSIS technique to overcome the drawbacks of fuzzy sets and provide a handy tool for corporate decision-making, as well as fully considering the interdependent and systematic feature of SRM and CS (Tseng et al., 2019a).

# 2.3. Proposed measures/practices

Extending products' life span (C1) was stated as a highly effective strategy for reducing the use of economic resource loop (Bocken et al., 2016). Meanwhile, through utilizing optimal capability (C2), firms can achieve greater efficient performance in generating and managing economic resource (Lin and Tseng, 2016). Additionally, applying quality management mechanism (C3) is essential to allow the industrial sector to meet satisfaction, and enable the generation of profit (Lim et al., 2017). With respect to the logistics, optimizing horizontal logistics (C4) is increasingly considered to be a viable approach to lower cost and increase service levels, which significantly promotes the profit margin for firm (Defryn et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2019b).

As for management strategies for environmental resource, adopting eco-design approach (C5) aims at minimizing environmental life cycle impacts, and thereby maximizing firms' limited environmental resource (Eksi and Karaosmanoglu, 2018). Besides, developing cleaner technology (C6) helps organizations to more effectively access natural resource, and produce products and services with less negative impacts (Büyüközkan and Çifçi, 2013). Considering that the sustainability reports can disclose the utilization of environmental resource, thus improving the transparency of sustainability reports (C7) plays a crucial role in increasing the environmental agility of firms (Roca and Searcy, 2012). Moreover, enhancing decision making resilience (C8) enables the dynamic decision while encountering the environmental pressure from internal and external stakeholders (Galpin et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2019).

Social resource always includes the issue of engagement and relationship which involves diverse and various stakeholders (Wu et al., 2019b; Singh et al., 2019). Therefore, organizing synergetic involvement (C9) can be applied to obtain social resource through aligning

Stakeholders’ engagement with a firm’s tactics (Wu et al., 2019b). Also, increasing employees' and customers' awareness (C10) will be of benefit to enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization through acquiring positive social resources (Shi et al., 2017). Moreover, raising institution's support and policy measures (C11) is capable of establishing social collaboration and participation among key stakeholders in society such as producers, consumers and government (Singh et al., 2019). Finally, advocating corporate culture (C12) is involved in the sustainable resource beliefs of a firm, which are embedding in arranging the social resource (Bonn and Fisher, 2011; Tseng et al., 2019b).

Industrial sector needs to take social and economic concepts into account simultaneously in order to address the SRM issue with regard to current product policies, market dynamics and competitive advantages (Singh et al., 2019). Thus, improving stakeholder interactions (C13) should be adopted as a core practice to achieve resource management goals, which is a manifestation of power embedded in the relationship between stakeholders and the SRM target (Frooman, 1999; Lin et al., 2019). After the stakeholders employ firms' resource to create value, it is beneficial for building value proposition (C14), which includes social value proposition and economic value proposition (Kristensen and Renmmen, 2019). Additionally, building eco-friendly rewarding systems for employees (C15) should be applied to integrate firms' economic development goal with performance evaluation system (Lozano, 2015).

On the macro level, there is a conflict between the quality and quantity of economic activities, the former is too inefficient, while the latter is stated to be too extensive, which leads to large-scale environmental problems (Daly, 1992; IPCC, 2014). To address this issue, eco-efficiency is proposed as a win-win strategy for firms to target a less harmful use of natural resources, and reduces cost for the company (Heikkurinen et al., 2019). Accordingly, encouraging environmental innovation (C16) can deliver a win-win situation for the economic and environment resource (Liao et al., 2018). Then, pushing the sustainability agenda into government policy (C17) has been argued that mostly in the sphere of eco-efficiency, which is an effective means to address sustainability issue and the financial bottom line of firm (DeSimone and Popoff, 1999; Dauvergne and Lister, 2012; Heikkurinen et al., 2019). In addition, redesigning consumers' offer (C18) enables reduction of the environmental load of the use phase (Baines et al., 2007; Heikkurinen et al., 2019).

Socio-environmental practices reflect various facets for solving internal and external sustainability issues, and reconcile company orientation with stakeholders’ needs (Spiller, 2000; Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006). Thus, pursuing eco-resource efficiency orientation (C19) can be expressed that maximize output while minimizing resources utilization without degrading social and environmental aspects (Horton et al., 2016; Von Geibler et al., 2016). Moreover, a potential effective way of managing a company's environmental policy is by socially linking it with purchasing function activities (Humphreys et al., 2004), for instance, selecting and collaborating with green supplier (C20) focuses on the buyer-supplier relationship where close relationship is necessary and capabilities are required (Sarkis and Talluri, 2002). At the same time, enhancing environmental awareness (C21) can be used to prevent negative impacts on the environment, as well as affecting the strategic development and their corporate reputation (Matos and Hall, 2007; Eltayeb et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2019a).

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Fuzzy cluster method

This study applies FCM to categorize the proposed SRM criteria into several corresponding CS aspects. Supposing the raw cluster matrix is R = [rij]n×n, where rij denotes the degree of experts' judgement, which can be stated as the following equation.

Subsequently, the entropy associated with each item can be calculated by means of the following equation.

Where r represents the entropy for each indicator. If an indicator has smaller r, it has higher weight (Ding et al., 2017).

|Linguistic preference|Corresponding vague value|μ|ν|

Next, the degree of discriminability can be attained through applying the following equation:

dE r 7 1 rE (7) Where 1 − χrE represents the degree of divergence.

After obtaining the entropy and the degree of discriminability, the following equation can be used to determine the entropy weight rx for each alternative.

rE 7 dE r r71dE r (8) The decision matrix in TOPSIS can be generated based on the obtained aggregated matrix S, then it has to be normalized for attaining the normalized decision matrix =:

3.3. Vague set

Given that there are a set of criteria c = {c1, c2, …, cγ}, and the group of experts can be expressed as {d | 1 ≤ t ≤ n}, thereinto, n refers to the number of experts inside group. Initially, the original assessment information was present in the form of linguistic preference, such as very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), low (L) and very low (VL). Then the qualitative information must be transferred into corresponding vague value, as shown in Table 1. After obtaining the vague assessment matrix, pijt was adopted to represent the transferred vague assessment result of expert d t t = [E αβt, Fαβt]γ×γ, where 0 ≤ Eαβt ≤ Fαβt ≤ 1. Detailly, on criterion ci of cj, meanwhile, pijt was present with vague set, i.e. p ij.

Subsequently, this study applies the calculated entropy weight in Section 3.2 to calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix Z, which can be stated as the following equation:

Z7 [ z ]7 ij rE× S (21) After acquiring the weighted normalized decision matrix, the positive ideal solution x + and the negative ideal solution x − are determined by Eq. (22) and Eq. (23), respectively.

x + = { 1 , z+ … z , + =[ max nz+]} (22)

x − = { 1z ,… z , … z } =[ max zi (23)

Next, using n-dimensional Euclidean distance to compute the geometric distance of a criterion si from the positive ideal solution x + is given as:

DF 7 n (z ij zF), i 7 1, 2, 3 …,m 2 (24)

Similarly, the Euclidean distance of a criterion si from the negative ideal solution x − is presented as below.

D 7 n (z ij z ), i 7 1, 2, 3 …, m. (25)

Ultimately, the overall performance score, namely, the relative closeness of the criterion si is compared with positive ideal solution x +, which can be defined as follow:

RC i7 D i F D iF, i 7 1, 2, …Di ,m. (26) Where 0≤RCi ≤ 1, and the obtained value RC i provide the ranking of each criterion, and the criteria acquires higher ranking are those that have higher overall performance score RC i.

# 4. Results

Consequently, the ranking results of 21 criteria can be described as C16 > C11 > C4 > C9 > C18 > C21 > C8 > C20 > C1 > C5 > C14 > C12 > C6 > C7 > C2 > C3 > C13 > C19 > C10 > C17 > C15, similarly, the ranking order of 6 aspects can be expressed as A5 > A3 > A2 > A6 > A1 > A4. In addition, Fig. 1 depicts the results of sensitivity analysis while considering if includes the entropy weight calculated from social media data into the proposed hybrid method. The result indicated that there are four gaps existing in the criterion of C19, C17, C15, C10 which is consistent with the evaluation result. Thus, this study suggests that social media information can reveal the real situation of performing SRM practice, as well as present a more balanced CS development phenomenon among SRM criteria.

# 5. Implications

# 5.1. Theoretical implications

There is an obvious conflict between the economic growth and environmental protection in the industry when developing CS, because firms often assume substitutability between economic and environmental resources, and focus on relative efficiency gains, whereas largely ignores the rebound effect (Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl, 2013; Fuchs et al., 2015). The results show eco-efficiency can provide a trade-off towards an overall improvement. The aspect of eco-efficiency (A5) ranks first among all the aspects, referring that to reduce the consumption on natural resources needs to depend on encouraging environmental innovation (C16) and redesigning the consumers' offer (C18). Encouraging environmental innovation is important to achieving highly efficient production technology and methods to improve CS performance. Moreover, through encouraging environmental innovation, the industry can have the capacity to address preservation of natural resources, industrial efficiency and finally achieve the profit improvement. Therefore, eco-efficiency can provide both environmental and economic benefits through production efficiency.

Although social resource is argued as an inessential part in SRM (Sanginga et al., 2003), this study supports Bouwen and Taillieu (2004) that the social aspect presents great benefits to pursue CS through SRM practice. Therein, organizing synergetic involvement (C9) entails the alignment of multiple stakeholders’ engagement with firms' CS strategy, and long-term cooperative relationships between themselves and investors in capital markets. Without organizing synergetic involvement...

involvement to obtain social resource in SRM, the common interests However, to achieve CS goal, -rms need to transfer their business strategy and product designed concept into corresponding SRM practice. Geely Automobile Group performed a shift from “low cost and high quality” to “more safe, eco-friendly and energy-saving cars”. Also, Geely Automobile Group invested efforts in research and development process in terms of alternative fuels and fuel cells. The focal -rm witnessed all have a decent CS performance after the implementation of the SRM practice of encouraging environmental innovation.

# 5.2. Practical implications

Encouraging environmental innovation (C16) reveals that -rms should make endeavor to develop more eco-friendly technologies. Although many -rms started to take the environmental innovation into consideration of short-term business strategy, they neglected the long-term benefit according to encouraging environmental innovation. For instance, the Great Wall decided to redesign the customers' offer and begun to launch a fashion and sports.

car model under SRM concept, resulting in the selling of the new model reaching over 10 thousand in several months. Accordingly, when customers present a desire for sustainable production, firms should adjust and redesign the customers' offer with the purpose of adapting to the new and real market situation.

Raising institution's support and policy measures (11) played a significant role in improving CS performance for Chinese automobile industry. In prior literature, the importance of institutional support and government-support measures in stimulating technological innovation was researched extensively (Veblen, 1915; Nelson, 2008). Lundvall (1992) also emphasized the embedding organizations and institutions can actively advance the role of research and development in each industry. This study has found the similar conclusion in the Chinese automobile industry. For example, in response to the policy of energy-saving and emission-reduction, Chery has undertaken many national key researches and development tasks of new energy technology, and consequently achieved a profit increase of 35.7% in 2017. This evidence proves that the institution's support and policy can push firms towards CS goal.

Moreover, one of the goals of SRM is to promote resource and energy optimization, better infrastructure, and access to basic amenities, green environment through organizing synergetic involvement (C9). Organizing synergetic involvement implies firms should align stakeholders' engagement with a firm's CS target. In the real situation, firms always seek more involvement or alliances among stakeholders' in supply chain networks, for instance, China First Automobile Group (FAW) always aims at protecting and aligning its stakeholders, which has re-established it as the distributor support department to support distributors. Furthermore, existed literature has clearly suggested that synergetic involvement among stakeholders' is essential to improve CS performance (Bocken et al., 2014; Schoenherr and Speier-Pero, 2015).

This study presents three main contributions as follows: (1) it provides a theoretical contribution through collecting SRM measures/practices from previous literature and establish a comprehensive framework between SRM and CS. Thereinto, eco-efficiency, socio-environmental and socio-economic aspects were proposed to supplement TBL. (2) it provides a methodological contribution by integrating VS theory and TOPSIS method to study the interrelationship between SRM and CS, as well as gathering social media information and transfers them into corresponding entropy weight and make an improvement to efficiently reduce time consumption of decision making. Additionally, the result of sensitivity analysis shows that the integration with social media data can help effectively eliminate the subjective judgement, as well as identify practical gaps in real situation. (3) the obtained analytical results in this study can help decision-makers to select the decisive SRM practice which can be used to provide precise guidelines for Chinese automobile industry towards CS goal.

This study has several limitations that need future studies to overcome. First, the selected 21 SRM practices may not enough to reveal the real situation, thus future study may require taking more proper SRM practices into account. Moreover, this study proposed VS-TOPSIS to measure the geometric interrelationship among alternatives, while the causal relationship cannot be reflected. Hence, future study may need to consider further modifying this method.

# Abstract

The introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI has stimulated substantial discourse on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains such as academia, business, and society at large. Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI’s potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models.

# 1. Introduction

One million users in five days and 100 million monthly users just two months after launch: such record-breaking growth makes ChatGPT one of the fastest-growing consumer applications (Hu 2023). To put this into context, it took Instagram two and a half years to get 100 million users, and TikTok reached this milestone after nine months (Chow 2023). ChatGPT is just one—albeit prominent—example of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications. GAI refers to a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate text, images, audio, code, videos, and synthetic data (Davenport and Mittal 2022; Gordijn and Have 2023). Recent interest in GAI has been driven by the simplicity of the user interfaces, which allow seemingly everyone, regardless of prior expertise, to generate content within seconds. As of right now, practitioners and researchers stand at the very beginning of a journey to understand GAI’s capabilities, reach, and impact on society and economy alike. Multiple studies and research endeavors foresee potentially significant implications for companies’ processes, way of working, interaction with customers, and ultimately the core of their business models through GAI (Agrawal et al. 2022; Dwivedi et al. 2023). However, not all business functions and, subsequently, not all industries appear yet to be affected to the same degree by GAI. First analyses predict that white collar tasks such as administrative support will be more affected than manual labor-related functions required, for example, in construction or manufacturing which are less prone to automation (Eloundou et al. 2023). Already a few months after the launch of ChatGPT, confronting the public with the capabilities of such large language models (LLM), researchers and industry experts forecast a significant boost to human creativity and productivity while simultaneously estimating that 300 million jobs could be affected by AI, making it a potentially significant change driver in society (Kelly 2023). Also in the context of academic research, a discussion about the potential implications of GAI has started (e.g. Burger et al. 2023; Stokel-Walker 2022).

The past has shown that the emergence of groundbreaking technologies, such as personal computers or the internet, force companies to adapt and innovate their business models to stay competitive and relevant (Amit and Zott 2020). And the future influence of GAI is compared to that one of personal computers or the internet by industry experts (Konrad and Cai 2023). The rapid development of GAI is not only an external factor but a catalyst for internal change, requiring businesses to rethink and potentially restructure their business models to stay ahead in a highly competitive and swiftly evolving landscape.

The aim of this study is therefore to provide a BMI perspective on GAI, with two main contributions: (1) The derivation of six propositions about GAI’s potential impact on industry-overarching business and working environment dynamics as drivers for BMI. (2) Building on three BMI categories (a) value creation innovation, (b) new proposition innovation, and (c) value capture innovation (Kraus et al. 2022b), examining three industries, namely software engineering, healthcare, and financial services, with regards to the potential implications of GAI.

Given the empirical relevance and recency of the topic, an in-depth qualitative content analysis, based on a scoping review methodology that builds on an

extensive sample of 513 sources is utilized. The research protocol hereby yielded data points classified into two clusters, (a) data obtained from academic journal publications (n = 410), and (b) data acquired from non-academic sources, such as online newspapers and online repositories of the companies that have developed GAI (n = 103).

The study’s findings highlight how GAI’s rapid advancements enable novel capabilities, leading to improved efficiencies and the emergence of new products and services. Simultaneously, GAI is potentially transforming skill requirements, shifting the human role from content creation to evaluation and editing. GAI could also drive new revenue models and cost structures, lowering content production costs and enabling various innovative monetization strategies. As GAI continues to evolve, businesses must adapt to harness its power, with their future success depending on their ability to integrate GAI technologies and continually explore new growth opportunities. The rise of GAI represents a paradigm shift, democratizing knowledge access and content creation, ultimately reshaping how businesses operate and innovate.

Thereby, the study contributes to three academic discussions: First, it adds to the emerging discussion about the implications of GAI on businesses (e.g., Dwivedi et al. 2023; Daugherty et al. 2023; Mathew 2023) by adopting a BMI perspective. Second, it contributes to the growing discussion at the interface of digital technologies and BMI (e.g., Ancillai et al. 2023; Aström et al. 2022; Jorzik et al. 2023). Third, it extends the discussion of artificial intelligence and analytics in management context (e.g., Korherr et al. 2022; Korherr and Kanbach 2023; Sáez-Ortuño et al. 2023).

# Theoretical background: business model innovation

The investigation of business model development and innovation has emerged as a prominent area of research over recent decades (Clauss et al. 2020; Foss and Saebi 2016). Scholars have conceptualized BMI as an attempt to create, implement, and sustain strategies to generate, deliver, and capture value (Kraus et al. 2020). Innovation in this context involves modifying the architecture or configuration of a business model regarding its activities and components (Clauss et al. 2020; Dymitrowski and Mielcarek 2021; Reim et al. 2020). Lee et al. (2019) regard AI as a catalyst for BMI, providing momentum for companies to adapt their current approaches. Lindgren (2016) goes further, arguing that firms must incorporate advanced technologies such as AI to remain competitive. The recent emergence of GAI has further sparked this discussion. Consequently, business models are becoming increasingly divergent due to the groundbreaking technologies that have entered and altered the market. Existing literature focuses on the process of BMI and the nature of change, whereby the process is something internal (Katsamakas and Pavlov 2019) and the introduction of new tools such as ChatGPT can be seen as an external factor. The rapid development and progress of GAI requires firms to alternate. The significance of BMI is shifting from internal perspectives to external developments that impact a business and its need to innovate.

D. K. Kanbach et al.

The lifespan of a business model is often limited in rapidly evolving digital environments with new technologies, where a previously successful business model in the field of competitors is threatened (Valter et al. 2018). This means companies must proactively seek new configurations of their business model components, even before external pressures necessitate changes (Neuhuettler et al. 2020). In addition, in dynamic environments characterized by significant changes or technological breakthroughs such as the emergence of GAI, constant BMIs are essential (Breier et al. 2021). In the context of BMI, changes to specific business model components, such as the use of modern methods and techniques like those AI provides, can impact a firm’s success, even if not all components change simultaneously (Clauss et al. 2020). According to Clauss et al. (2020), changes to business models can vary in extent and scope, from incremental modifications to entirely novel and radical solutions forced by new technical opportunities. A recent model which builds upon the literature described above and captures the latest findings on BMI dimensions is developed by Kraus et al. (2022b) based on Clauss (2017) and Spieth and Schneider (2015). The framework includes the categories (1) value creation innovation, (2) new proposition innovation, and (3) value capture innovation, with accompanying sub-categories that each are potential drivers of innovation within the respective categories (see Fig. 1).

The model delineates three categories of BMI. First, in terms of “value creation innovation” technological advancements play a pivotal role in driving BMI (Clauss 2017). Companies striving to gain a competitive edge must continuously innovate through the adoption of new technologies or processes (Needleman et al. 2021). This necessitates the acquisition of expert knowledge of the new technology and its broader context (Desai et al. 2014). Regarding AI, companies must be adept at integrating technical innovations into an existing landscape. Second, “new proposition innovation” of BMI is driven by the emergence of new markets and sales channels, requiring organizations to adapt their internal and external communication processes (Needleman et al. 2021). The introduction of new products and services through BMI necessitates changes to the existing strategy of a company, which entails modifying both the technical implementations and process structures simultaneously. Last, the expansion of revenues is a significant driver of BMI in “value capture innovation.”

capture innovation. The advent of AI provides new value-creating opportunities, which necessitates the adoption of techniques that generate new cost streams. This categorization was selected as theoretical basis for this study for three main reasons. First, it integrates widely accepted and recent conceptualizations of BMI (e.g., Clauss 2017; Spieth and Schneider 2015). Second, it provides three condensed categories which build an ideal basis for the analysis of the impact of GAI. Third, it was developed in the context of analyzing BMI implications of another technological advancement, namely metaverse technology. In Sect. 5 of this study, we present the findings considering the outlined categories to clarify the impact of GAI on BMI—both industry overarching and narrowed down to three industry examples.

# 3 Development of generative artificial intelligence

It is widely argued that the important question is not if AI will play a role in the future, but rather which role it will take on, and more importantly, how humans can coexist with AI (Haenlein and Kaplan 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand the emergence of this technology. The roots of AI began with the foundational work of Alan Turing in the early 1950s. Turing introduced the notion of machine intelligence, proposing an imitation game to distinguish between human and machine responses (Turing 1950). Despite controversies surrounding the "Turing test," it became a cornerstone for the exploration of the human–machine boundary and remains influential in AI discourse (Haenlein and Kaplan 2019). A decade later, Joseph Weizenbaum introduced the chatbot ELIZA (Weizenbaum 1966) which is considered as pioneering work in the field of natural language processing (NLP) laying the foundation for today’s language models. The following decades further marked the advent of rule-based expert systems, employing predefined rules for output generation within specific domains (Buchanan and Smith 1988). These systems had limited generative capacity and were primarily used in narrow domains. However, their development led to recurrent neural networks for coherent text generation by predicting the probability of next words in a sequence (Marr 2019) and networks for improved pattern recognition (Huang 2023). The early 2000s saw a significant development with the rise of machine learning and deep learning, becoming more effective due to advancements in data availability and computational capabilities (Marr 2019). Driven by the availability of massive data volumes and the increased efficiency of graphics card processors, which drastically accelerated learning algorithms, breakthroughs were made in various areas such as advanced computer vision, speech recognition, image classification, and the ability to construct 3D scenes and assets out of 2D images (House 2019; Krizhevsky et al. 2017; Yoo et al. 2021). Based on these advancements, a recent progress in GAI are transformer-based LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) (OpenAI and Pilipiszyn 2021). Those GAI tools emerged rapidly in the public attention but have been in development for years and the release of GPT-2 in 2019 already marked the beginning of GAI’s power to unleash vast economic and societal transformation (Toews 2023). As of 2023, numerous GAI tools are available focusing on different tasks including for example the generation of text, image,

D. K. Kanbach et al.

video, audio, and code. Midjourney, for example, offers a text-to-image generator through the messenger-service Discord and a web app (Midjourney 2023). In addition to the seemingly omnipresent LLM from OpenAI, named Chat-GPT, Bard is another conversational GAI, powered by Google’s LLM “LaMDA” (Pichai 2023). Like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it was trained on a massive dataset and can be used to generate text, translate languages, create various kinds of content, and answer questions in an informative manner. Bard has been used in a variety of scientific applications, including data analysis, experiment design, literature review, and scientific writing. Despite Bard’s seemingly hasty release to rival ChatGPT, Google had already pioneered LLM development by publicly sharing its transformer deep learning model back in 2017.

The field has come a long way, from the early days of simple text creation to the complex and sophisticated application use cases seen today. The development of GAI today is marked by further advancements in algorithms and techniques that enable a generation of new and original content. Although these recent advancements are still far away from artificial general intelligence in which systems are capable of human-like behavior in all aspects, encompassing cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence, businesses in all industries should not neglect these developments. It is widely argued that we are entering a new era that will revolutionize how we obtain information, generate content, cater to consumer demands, and operate businesses (Daugherty et al. 2023).

# 4. Methodology and data

# 4.1 Approach

To gain an overview of the actual landscape in the field of GAI, we conducted a scoping review and categorized the publications and sources with a qualitative content analysis. The primary aim of this paper is to provide an initial understanding of the potential implications of GAI for BMI. Due to the novelty and rapid development of this technology, we employed a systematic scoping review method, incorporating scientific as well as non-scientific sources, to ensure the inclusion of developments on the forefront of the scientific as well as public discourse. More specifically, we followed a PRISMA-ScR, which ensures consistent reporting items by identifying, pre-selecting, checking the suitability, and finally deciding to include or exclude a source, as proposed by Tricco et al. (2018). In line with Kraus et al. (2022a) and Sauer and Seuring (2023), we conducted a systematic sampling technique involving a structured process for data collection to enhance our study’s reproducibility and transparency. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we additionally enriched the scientific sources with non-academic sources, including articles, books, pre-prints, press statements, and company websites, in addition to publicly available information such as podcasts, interviews, or event recordings capturing industry leaders’ opinions, as also applied by other scoping reviews analyzing recent emerging phenomena (e.g., Cheong et al. 2022; Murphy et al. 2021; Syrowatka et al. 2021). For the content analysis of the identified sources, we

# 4.2 Sample selection

We conducted a comprehensive search of databases, including EBSCO, Science-Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The data collection processes were conducted from March 15th to April 30th, 2023. The initial approach of the search scope resulted in targeting publications with the terms “business model (innovation)” and “generative AI” within either title or abstract. However, we realized that the combination of those terms is not sufficient for the analysis, and so we chose a broader approach, enhanced with manual selection and the precise narrowing down of the research funnel. Therefore, we opted for a dual search strain approach, completed by the inclusion of non-academic sources (see Fig. 2 for details).

In the first strain, we searched for “generative AI” terms (including spelling variations such as “Generative AI”, “Generative Artificial Intelligence”, “GAI”, “GenAI”) which resulted in 2845 hits in EBSCO. Narrowing this down further based on the exclusion of publications older than 2022 and additionally filtering for peer-reviewed publications resulted in 234 hits. The same search yielded 145 results from Web of Science, resulting in 26 narrowed down results. In ScienceDirect, this resulted in an initial 4748; again, this was considerably narrowed down to 76 results. Last, the same search conducted in Google Scholar resulted in 3407 hits, reduced by the filter criteria to 166. The total of 502 publications was then reduced by excluding duplications and manually removing publications that (a) did not match the topic; (b) were solely IT-focused (e.g., explaining the training of the datasets); and (c) that were not in English (if not already filtered automatically beforehand). This led to 143 publications.

The second search strain was conducted with specific companies and concrete applications, including “OpenAI,” “ChatGPT” (and its variations), “DALL-E,” “Midjourney,” “Jasper,” “StableAI,” and “Google Bard”. These specific GAI applications and companies were selected following Forbes’ AI 50 list by selecting companies which were additionally listed in the Market Insights report of Statista (Cai 2023; Senn-Kalb and Metha 2023), to ensure the inclusion listing of relevant applications and companies on the forefront of the public as well as scientific.

# D. K. Kanbach et al.

# Fig. 1

PRISMA-ScR for this paper’s publication selection (own illustration following Tricco et al. (2018))

Furthermore, we cross-referenced the actuality and importance by studying Google Trends in AI from September 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023 and hereby added more relevant companies, e.g., DALL-E. Given the rapid development of the technology, it is not possible to include all tools, services, and even companies who have launched GAI applications, but at the time of research we covered the most intensely discussed ones following (non-) scientific literature and AI trends in search engines by excluding the ones that do not concentrate on creating content (like text, audio, or video). This resulted in 40,045 hits in EBSCO; filtering for results only in 2022–2023, peer-reviewed, only including English results, and removing false hits.

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

led to 796 hits. In the ScienceDirect database, the same search led to an initial 4748 results, which was narrowed down to 505 hits. Applying the same search terms and mechanics for Web of Science resulted in 13,740 hits, narrowed down to 115 by applying the specific search criteria. All these results demonstrated a clear tendency of most of the publications to focus on ChatGPT as the most prominent application of GAI. Again, excluding duplicates and solely IT-focused publications and publications with a non-topic related focus led to 267 publications. This added up overall to 410 academic resources from the two search strains for further analysis.

Third, to stay true to the multifaceted approach to gathering relevant information from diverse sources and given the rapid development of the topic beyond academia, we conducted a keyword search using two prominent search engines, namely Google and Bing. The search results incorporated information from sources such as reports, articles, podcasts, interviews, and insights from industry experts, including consultancies. Given the number of sources, this last screening process was not conducted in an extensive, all-encompassing manner. Searching for the relevant terms in Google alone led to over 75,000 hits. Nevertheless, we included publications in renowned (online) news outlets and industry-related reports, such as Forbes, New York Times, Gartner, McKinsey, and Bain. We defined renowned news as articles from trustworthy companies and news outlets (see Glader 2017 for an overview). Additionally, we rely on the selected AI tools and companies’ websites due to their reputable standing in the field.

# 4.3 Descriptive results

The research protocol described above yielded a total of 513 data points classified into two clusters (a) data obtained from academic journal publications (n = 410), and (b) data acquired from non-academic sources, such as online newspapers and online repositories of the companies that have developed GAI (n = 103). GAI in general is a topic of great interest across various domains, industries, and research disciplines. The versatility of GAI has made it applicable to seemingly every domain. In particular, the recent hype and spike in research are based on the advancements in the technology and access to large datasets and computing resources, which have resulted in improved GAI algorithms with intuitive operating interfaces and handling. The vast applications of the technology have fueled research interest in it almost as rapidly as the increase in investments in AI companies.

First, we screened and categorized the sources based on the type of GAI mentioned within the publication. In line with Aydin and Karaarslan (2023), we again classified the types of GAI as “text to…” text, image, video, audio, or code. In this way, each category is reflective of the use of GAI based on a prompted written command and differentiated between the type of output generated, namely the beforehand mentioned five categories. While screening the sources it was searched for the main focus type of GAI of the publication and multiple counts are included, as the majority of sources concentrated on more than one type of GAI. In addition, data analysis is added as a general category to describe the use of GAI in analytical capacities, varying from, for example, drug discovery (Chen 2021; Patronov et al.

D. K. Kanbach et al.

(2022) and data analytics in business education and research (Cribben and Zeinali 2023) to data interpretation to counter global warming (Biswas 2023a). The distribution across the different categories is thereby not mutually exclusive. Table 1 presents the exact distribution of the types of GAI in the sample.

Moreover, we examined the industry context in which GAI is mentioned. Again, the results of the screening are not mutually exclusive and, frequently, multiple industries were mentioned in one publication or none. Table 2 shows the most frequently included industries, starting with “healthcare” (95), followed by “education” (92) and “media, creative, and journalism” (51). In addition, “academic research” included 142 sources; 128 were industry “unspecified” and multiple industries, with fewer than ten counts excluded in this overview, ranging from agriculture (Biswas 2023b; Wiles 2023) to tourism and hospitality (Carvalho and Ivanov 2023; Erul and Isin 2023). Moreover, the conscious decision to exclude purely technical publications from the data set does not imply that we disregarded software engineering. In fact, most of the papers included a perspective into how new software solutions could influence their respective area of study.

As the data analysis demonstrates, the remarkable progress of GAI, especially in natural language understanding and content generation, has undoubtedly prompted the interest of researchers and practitioners. The analysis further shows that research regarding GAI varies widely in its focus, (technological) depth, and methodology, in addition to whether GAI will result in beneficial effects or if the negative consequences will prevail. The research types vary from short, explorative papers commenting on chat interview protocols, setting the output of mainly ChatGPT into context (Biswas 2023a; Du et al. 2023a; Iskender 2023; Lund and Wang 2023; Neves 2022; Wang et al. 2023a; Wang et al. 2023a), to broad, multidisciplinary perspectives on a variety of topics, implications and industry analysis, primarily conducted by research collectives (e.g., Dwivedi et al. 2023). In addition, other studies and publications focus on overarching topics, for example ethical discussions (e.g., Motoki et al. 2023; Youvan 2023; Zhuo et al. 2023).

# 5.1 Analysis of business model components and innovation activities: six propositions

Based on our analysis, we explore the multifaceted impact and potential of GAI, emphasizing its transformative capacity for business models. Building on our sample, we derive six propositions to provide an initial view of GAI´s capabilities to impact (1) innovation activities, (2) work environment, and (3) information infrastructure. Based on the outlined BMI categories (Kraus et al. 2022b), we discuss the potential of GAI impact in three specific industries (see Fig. 3).

# Proposition I—Initiators of Innovations

GAI levels the playing field for innovators from all regions and social backgrounds by providing access to expertise, technology, and resources.

The first experiences with GAI demonstrate in many business areas that holding specific knowledge becomes a less important factor in work and innovation success. For example, a study conducted by Noy and Zhang (2023) indicates that the disparity among employees diminishes as ChatGPT narrows the productivity distribution by providing greater benefits to workers with lower abilities, ergo leveling the playing field (Noy and Whitney 2023). GAI democratizes prior knowledge by evening out educational disadvantages, language discrepancies, and individual handicaps (see, e.g., Gimpel et al. 2023). A very precise application of this is provided by Yue et al. (2023) as they examine the possibility of utilizing Explainable AI and large language models, such as ChatGPT, to transfer financial knowledge to individuals without financial backgrounds (Yue et al. 2023). The study rests upon experimentation and demonstrates that ChatGPT has significant potential as a resource for conveying multifaceted financial concepts to diverse target groups.

Beyond knowledge accessibility, GAI theoretically provides technology and resources to almost everybody. For example, it not only assists in writing code (knowledge), but it can also run it no matter how resource-intense the execution is or how expensive the appropriate software tool is. CTO of Microsoft Kevin Scott describes another example of how new AI tools are democratizing access.

Fig. 3 Propositions of GAI’s impact on businesses (own illustration)

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

to design: “An AI system such as DALL-E 2 doesn’t turn ordinary people into professional artists, but it gives a ton of people a visual vocabulary that they didn’t have before—a new superpower they didn’t think they would ever have. […] The applications of GAI are potentially endless, limited only by one’s ability to imagine scenarios in which productivity-assisting software could be applied to complex cognitive work, whether that be editing videos, writing scripts, designing new molecules for medicines, or creating manufacturing recipes from 3D models” (Scott 2023). Consequently, fewer hardware investments are required, democratizing access to technology.

To conclude, GAI has the potential to shift more of the focus on creativity and the uniqueness of ideas irrespective of a person’s regional or social background—truly leveling the playing field.

# Proposition II—Degree of Innovations:

GAI’s sweet spot lies in business models that rest upon a combination of factual knowledge and creative thinking. This is where the potential for fast new proposition innovations and value capture innovations is highest.

Much is currently being written about how many repetitive, fixed-knowledge activities can be automated by GAI (e.g., product descriptions, categorizing, writing code), and the opportunities GAI opens to get creative (e.g., writing stories, creating image ads, generating video clips). However, our analysis shows that the greatest potential of GAI for business model innovation now lies between factual knowledge and creative thinking. This follows from two factual statements.

First, repetitive activities are mostly already inexpensive, either because they are performed by a less skilled workforce or because they are already partially automated (see, e.g., Kagermann 2015). Thus, on this side of the spectrum, the business case is not very strong. Second, although we do observe high-value creation in extremely creative business areas (e.g., art, film, photography), this commercial success depends only partly on the craftsmanship of creativity. More decisive for success is usually the story’s ability to resonate with the audience (e.g., Wieczerzycki and Deszczyński 2022). GAI certainly offers the potential to move into this area soon, but for now, it remains difficult to imagine that the next best-selling book, the next blockbuster movie, or even the next multi-million-dollar painting will be generated solely via GAI. In any case, commercial success in this area remains harder to predict and uncertain (see, e.g., Berg 2022).

However, this is different for business models that are based on the combination of complex knowledge and creative solution orientation. The workforce in such businesses is more expensive and rarer, whereas the working approaches are still fairly rule-based. Examples are lawyers, auditors, notaries, consultants, software engineers, architects, doctors, and therapists. Frequently, these are also the areas where, traditionally, the cost of making errors is very high and expert responsibility is key (e.g., the audit of financial statements or notaries carrying the risk of a contract’s inaccuracy). It is worth mentioning that GAI or the companies behind it do not assume this responsibility by default. In fact, it remains an open question for the future whether GAI can ever do this. Nonetheless, from a value creation perspective, this is the area where GAI’s impact can be maximized—by removing the bottleneck of the most demanded knowledge workers first.

# Proposition III—Timing of Innovation:

GAI affects most businesses via the extension of existing products and services as readily attainable innovations are prioritized.

The impact of GAI on new offerings will most likely be significant and shall not be underestimated. As Przegalinska and Jemielniak (2023) argue, the shift towards embracing GAI will lead to new offerings and business models which cannot yet be imagined. However, many current offerings are clearly enhanced by adding GAI.

Many businesses embrace the integration of GAI into their existing products and services. This approach focuses on incremental changes that improve user experience, making products more accessible, efficient, and streamlined. This approach can be observed from the releases of, for example, Adobe 2023; Canva 2023; GitHub 2023a; Microsoft 2023; Sean 2023; Spataro 2023. These large corporations did not revamp their complete software product suites but rather prioritized readily attainable innovation and integration. This approach allows businesses to experiment with the technology, refine its applications, and learn from valuable user feedback. It also enables companies to leverage their established brand, distribution channels, and customer base, thus mitigating the risks associated with the introduction of entirely new products and creating a lock-in effect. In this manner, the more GAI is integrated, the more they are put in a position of power to potentially increase their pricing for “smarter” software products. This also implies higher entry barriers for smaller, new market players. As the maturity of GAI progresses, business will potentially be better positioned to develop and launch novel products and services, instead of making existing offerings “just” faster. Although there are initial examples emerging, these new offerings will potentially disrupt market dynamics more drastically by leveraging the technology to a larger degree and ultimately replacing human input in various capacities.

This already observable tendency will most likely have various BMI implications with the adoption of new, AI-powered services and features in existing products, helping companies to advance their offerings. In addition, the newly added features, which will result in an eased user experience, can potentially enable new customers to be targeted, which—in the case of graphic design tools—suddenly requires fewer skills (Agrawal, Gans and Goldfarb, 2022). Overall, customer relationships can be strengthened, and lock-in effects can be created via even more features and smarter, more intuitive solutions which are valued by customers. Lastly, value capture innovation, new pricing, and a potentially altered cost structure will be possible after the roll-out of even more GAI features in existing products. However, the sole implementation of additional features will most likely not result in a completely new revenue model. As the example of (corporate) software adding those smart features makes clear, subscription-based models remain their go-to solution.

# Proposition IV—Impact:

GAI has its highest impact on the jobs of white-collar knowledge workers, for whom entire job roles will be replaced, reshaped, or elevated.

The effects of GAI on the labor market are estimated to be substantial. Recently, Goldman Sachs predicted that 300 million jobs could be affected by AI (Kelly 2023) and Accenture found that 40% of all working hours may be impacted by LLMs such as GPT-4 (Daugherty et al. 2023). GAI has the potential to revolutionize the nature

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

of work for white-collar knowledge workers, as outlined in Proposition I, driven by the automation of repetitive, fixed-knowledge activities. According to Cardon et al. (2022), the anticipated AI revolution is based on three observable tendencies: the integration of GAI into core products by major software vendors, rapid user adoption of AI tools, and the continuous release of new AI applications. Particularly higher-income jobs with advanced language and communication skills are at greater risk of exposure to AI-driven disruption (Felten et al. 2023). More specifically, GAI tools have the potential to replace or reshape numerous jobs. Noy and Whitney (2023) find that ChatGPT primarily serves as a replacement for employee effort, shifting tasks towards idea generation and editing. Particularly affected jobs will be those with highly repetitive tasks, for example, data entry clerks, customer service representatives, proofreaders, paralegals, and bookkeepers (Mok and Zinkula 2023; Schafer 2023; Zhang et al. 2023). However, the situation is not entirely bleak. GAI also creates new jobs as demonstrated by the increase in open position postings related to (generative) AI tasks (Tarrant 2023). In addition, the rise of GAI offers opportunities to elevate existing professions, for example customer service jobs (Daugherty et al. 2023). By examining how white-collar workers spent their workday, GAI could enable them to devote their time to more advanced cognitive tasks, profoundly altering the way they engage with technology to accomplish tasks (Scott 2023). This would not only potentially enhance customer relationships by offering more efficient customer-service (e.g., 24/7), but simultaneously reshape processes through streamlined workflow and the elimination of repetitive tasks, allowing employees to, for example, focus on meaningful customer interaction or creativity-related tasks. One hypothesis is that by automating tasks, workers in, for example, care-related jobs—which are currently often undervalued and underpaid—can free up time for human-related tasks (Gupta 2022). This could potentially result in a more balanced and fulfilling labor market, with a greater focus on social priorities due to the additional time that was previously spent on repetitive tasks. The outcome will most likely be one of two scenarios: increased efficiency or reduced working hours. In the first scenario, the increased efficiency of white-collar workers results in a higher output with similar working hours. In the second scenario, workers produce the same output in less time, leading to a reduction of working hours (Rees 2023). Both scenarios raise questions about the future structure of the workday, compensation, and overall implications for the labor market. This potential change in output can result in a range of consequences, from small efficiency gains and potential cost reductions due to a smaller necessary workforce to a complete shift of how society operates, for example.

# Proposition V—Skill Set:

GAI redefines the skill set required to generate content as many job roles transform from creators to editors—human amplification and not complete substitution.

The use of AI is transforming the required skillset of employees (Santana and Díaz-Fernández 2022). The rapid development of GAI is transforming the landscape of content production and impacting the capabilities of both companies and their employees. Content production is meant in the broadest sense as generating media output from given input. This transformation is causing a paradigm shift in the human role within the creative process. Traditionally, humans have been the primary

creators of content. There was no possibility—especially not a publicly accessible one—of generating (high-quality) ideas and shaping them into consumable forms without manual labor. The rise of GAI has challenged this idea, prompting a revolution of the human role in content production. GAI gives content creators powerful tools, erasing the entry barriers to many jobs (Towson 2023). GAI tools have already significantly reduced the marginal cost of content creation (OpenAI 2023). These algorithms generate vast amounts of content with minimal human input. Workers’ skillsets can and must therefore adapt to deliver value in the generating content process. Individuals should evaluate the quality and relevance of the seeming abundance in a world with a zero-marginal content cost (Noy and Whitney 2023). Therefore, one of the most critical skills in this new paradigm is judgment (Fridman 2019). The ability to discern good from mediocre or irrelevant content becomes paramount. This emphasis on curation necessitates the development of critical thinking, analytical, and evaluative skills, enabling individuals to assess the value, resonance, and impact of AI-generated content—a task that cannot yet be automated. In addition, these skills empower individuals to mold and refine the generated content, aligning it with the intended purpose and audience. The integration of GAI in content production offers new capabilities and the potential for increased effectiveness when employed correctly. By leveraging AI-generated content, individuals can focus on refining and tailoring the output to suit specific needs, thus enhancing its overall efficiency. In this manner, the collaboration between GAI and humans has the potential to unlock unprecedented levels of creativity and productivity. As Mostaque, the CEO of StabilityAI, euphorically predicted, “with AI we figured out how to make humans scale” (Goldman Sachs 2023). Time will tell if this prediction becomes reality. Overall, it can be summarized that GAI’s anticipated ability to decrease the marginal cost of content production could lead to significant business model innovations along the whole value chain, enabling companies to create and capture value in new ways. This will begin with small achievements which make existing tasks quicker with the new capabilities to completely new processes, and lastly, entirely new revenue models. The integration of GAI could unlock innovative revenue models by capitalizing on its capacity to augment human creativity and decrease content production costs, ultimately promoting value capture and business growth. This would work, for example, by differentiation between freemium and premium content: By employing GAI to produce high-quality content cost-effectively, businesses can offer basic content for free and reserve exclusive, personalized content for paying customers.

# Proposition VI—Consume or Customize:

It is not a question of if GAI will be used by companies but how it will be built or integrated into the company’s data infrastructure.

As GAI becomes increasingly pervasive, companies should decide how to adapt their processes to harness this technology’s potential. Przegalinska and Jemielniak (2023) argue that every company must embrace AI technology or risk obsolescence. Consequently, companies face the question of how to use this new technology appropriately. They have three overarching opportunities: utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs; customizing models for specific use cases (independently or with external assistance, e.g., consultancies or technology providers such as Google, NVIDIA, or

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

Microsoft); creating their own LLMs, or a combination of the former (Daugherty et al. 2023; Pounds 2023). Key factors in this decision include mitigating the risk of proprietary data leakage and balancing the potentially large costs of training and inference with the anticipated benefits. In addition, especially regarding BMI and the required adaptation to a changing environment, time-to-market is a crucial factor. Pre-trained, existing LLMs offer the fastest deployment, followed by the customization of models, whereas in-house development of an own model may take longer to fully implement. Furthermore, off-the-shelf LLMs are accessible and easy to deploy, even for non-experts, allowing employees to integrate GAI into various business areas, such as marketing or customer-facing processes (Dwivedi et al. 2023). However, as businesses require more specialized solutions, customization becomes increasingly important. Customized models demand higher investment and capabilities, but potentially enable deeper process innovation and differentiation in the long run. Security and data concerns are paramount when adopting GAI technology. Third-party providers address these concerns by offering separate instances for different tenants to prevent data leakage. The full scope of business process disruption remains uncertain, but it is likely to affect every industry. Third-party providers facilitate the use of customized GAI solutions as opposed to using pre-trained models such as GPT-4 directly via API. One example is Epic’s implementation of Chat-GPT in the healthcare sector (Microsoft News Center 2023). Ultimately, the choice between adopting an existing GAI or building a company specific LLM will significantly impact the organization’s data structure and setup. Consequently, this will impact the company’s differentiation and value creation, and can be a success factor when it comes to constantly innovating the business model and staying relevant.

# 5.2 Industry case studies

In line with the BMI categories, we analyze potential GAI implications for the sectors software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. With new technologies as a key factor in the reconfiguration of business models (Clauss 2017), the integration of GAI in various use cases and capacities will undisputedly alter many industries, the question is to what extent. The following analysis focuses on the degree to which three selected industries will be changed, from incremental improvements and efficiency gains to completely new revenue and business models. In these examples, we discuss the potential impact of GAI on business models, following the logic of three underlying categories—value creation innovation, new proposition innovation, and value capture innovation—with respective sub-categories, as described in Sect. 2. Along these categories, we provide examples to demonstrate the varying degrees of change that can potentially be caused by GAI in the future—or those that are already visible today. Revisiting the previously discussed six propositions, the extent of the expected influence on the business model components exhibits a broad range. The presented industry examples serve as explanatory demonstrations of the application of the BMI categories and basis for transfer to further industries. Therefore, the industries have been selected in a way to cover a great variety of different sectors with varying use cases for GAI. The first one depicts software engineering,

# 5.2.1 Case study #1 software engineering

Through automated code generation, documentation, bug detection, and performance optimization, GAI is predicted to impact the software engineering landscape (Greymatter 2023a, b; Baker 2023). Already today, Stable AI’s CEO, Mostaque, notes that 41% of new GitHub code is AI-generated (Goldman Sachs, 2023b). Google recently made headlines by stating that ChatGPT could hypothetically pass interviews to be hired as an entry-level software engineer, citing internal Google sources (Elias 2023). Through cloud-based platforms and online offerings, the sector could become more accessible to non-technical users. Entrepreneurs on the forefront of GAI development foresee that developers will become more like product managers, specifying, customizing, and editing rather than coding themselves. This could trigger a change in developers’ work, from writing code to strategic decision making (Brady 2023), with some calling the rise of GAI in software engineering a paradigm shift as significant as the cloud or DevOps (Shank and Combs 2023).

# 5.2.1.1 Value creation innovation

New capabilities exist already and are predicted to grow further, including automated code generation, error detection, and resolution. Examples include Wolverine.py, which automatically finds errors in Python scripts and fixes them (GitHub 2023a); the performance optimization of existing code and software (Daugherty et al. 2023); or automated documentation writing and translating code from one language to another, helping with legacy migration (Shank and Combs 2023). Moreover, the implementation of GAI makes programming easier and faster overall (Boza 2021). One study found that developers who used GitHub Copilot reported feeling 88% more productive (Kalliamcakou 2022).

New technologies and equipment become prevalent in a shift from traditional computing to large-scale deep learning models, for example NLP as well as other machine learning frameworks. New and adapted processes could be necessary as the friction to start to code disappears (Thompson 2023), challenging the traditional role of distribution in software development. Sprint plannings and product owners as the intermediates between developers and the business stakeholders in agile project setups, as they are typical in especially but not exclusively tech companies, might become less important. GAI is making it possible to write code simultaneously in different languages and for different operating systems (Seshia et al. 2022). Consequently, application development becomes faster and entails lower costs (resulting in cheaper content production, as discussed in proposition III).

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

# 5.2.1.2 New proposition innovation

New offerings could be imaginable in the form of AI-powered software development platforms, integrating AI tools for code generation and testing. The reduced entry barrier allows people without a technical background to start coding. Consequently, new offerings could reduce the hurdle faced by new, non-technical developers when starting a project or certain tasks. These non-traditional, AI-enabled developers represent new customers and markets for the software industry. The relationship with customers is shifting as well: developers move forward with new tasks more quickly and are more reliant than ever on their tooling.

# 5.2.1.3 Value capture innovation

GAI could transform the value cost structure of the software engineering industry by boosting operational efficiency, automating tasks, and reducing overheads—especially for junior developers (Hassan 2023; van Gool 2023)—and enabling more scalable solutions. This could result in reduced costs, optimized resource allocation, and quicker time-to-market, with shorter development cycles and less downtime for developers, thus freeing up time for additional projects. New revenue models could be imaginable, with marketplace solutions for plug-ins and extensions of LLM models, which increase functionalities and data, creating an ecosystem around the GAI APIs.

# 5.2.2 Case study #2 healthcare (AI-powered therapies)

There are few sectors in which people are so prone to searching the internet for their problems before consulting an expert. Studies indicate that many individuals research medical symptoms online, or even self-diagnose based solely on online information (Hochberg et al. 2020). Among these search inquiries, mental health issues have been growing (WHO 2022). To counter this expanding need, digital mental health solutions, including AI chatbots, are on the rise (Hamdoun et al. 2023) and consequently the emotional comprehension capabilities of GAI are gaining attention (Uludag 2023). Assuming users’ data privacy is safeguarded, encrypted GAI chatbots can serve as confidants, allowing individuals to share their emotions, or psychological symptoms, and feel heard (Eshghi 2023). By enabling healthcare providers to analyze vast amounts of medical data and make more accurate diagnoses, in addition to making more data-driven decisions, valuable time could be freed up for healthcare providers (Dilmegani 2023; Lin 2023). Through virtual and hybrid concepts, or completely outsourcing tasks to AI-powered bots, therapy could be made accessible to a wider group of patients in the future. However, some experts emphasize that mental health apps should only be used as a supplement to in-person therapy (Wakefield 2023).

# 5.2.2.1 Value creation innovation

AI-driven diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and virtual mental health support are potential new capabilities with which doctors could provide better-quality care to more patients. New technology and equipment could amplify their work, enabling them to treat more patients by utilizing, for example, NLP powered chatbots, which would act as virtual therapists to pre-diagnose or screen patients or provide 24/7 support (Metz 2023).

# 5.2.2.2 New proposition innovation

New offerings and new channels could include AI-powered therapy apps, online mental health support platforms and communities, therapy with virtual reality, or self-help courses with customized topics tailored to the individual needs, all powered with NLP, sentiment analysis, and machine learning. New customers and markets could be reached because of the reduced costs, making healthcare cheaper and more accessible by automating, for example, pre-screening or AI-conducted pre-diagnosis (Greymatter 2023b). In addition, new customer relationships might be formed with more autonomous and informed patients, who can monitor their own condition better and provide valuable feedback and actual data (e.g., with smart wearables combined), thus enhancing the therapy’s success.

# 5.2.2.3 Value capture innovation

Increasing numbers of pay-per-session and subscription-based models have appeared in recent years (e.g., Stanford therapy chatbot or Woebot Health). AI-powered mental health solutions will most likely decrease costs drastically and thereby enable a broader patient group to access the services. A freemium model is imaginable in which some services and assistance, for example via chat, are free, whereas consultations with a human doctor are charged. Value cost structure can be impacted through efficiency gains, reduced overheads, more automation, and the outsourcing of repetitive tasks, meaning that human doctors can shift their focus towards value-adding tasks. In addition, the extended, potentially global reach allows for an unprecedented scalability of services. So, what should we expect? Mental health chatbots, increasingly popular and smart, will most likely provide a discreet, convenient avenue for addressing mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, or stress in the future to a growing target group who require assistance.

# 5.2.3 Case study #3 financial services (investment management)

GAI has the potential to impact investment management through data analysis, risk assessment, and decision-making (Ko and Lee 2023). By employing sophisticated algorithms to process vast amounts of financial data, GAI could identify patterns, predict market trends, and uncover investment prospects. This would ultimately enhance investment strategies, optimize returns, automate due diligence, and improve portfolio performance (Daugherty et al. 2023).

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

GAI could help with fraud detection as well as customer-facing tasks such as personalized financial advice in wealth management, for example (Schmidt and Albright 2023). It appears that change is already happening, with new tools such as the IPO prediction software developed by PitchBook (Wiggers 2023); the “ChatGPT of finance,” Finchat; or the launch of Bloomberg’s own 50-billion parameter large language model (Bloomberg 2023). Another example is GPTQuant, a conversational AI chatbot for developing and evaluating investment strategies (Yue and Au 2023). Initial harbingers can be seen in the surge of job postings related to AI in the financial sector: Stanford’s AI Index Report (Maslej 2023) places the AI job postings in the finance industry as the third highest out of all industries. Nonetheless, in an industry where trust is crucial and that is traditionally not an early adopter (Hinkfuss 2023), it is especially necessary to ensure the safe, reliable, and compliant usage of GAI (Lau 2023).

# 5.2.3.1 Value creation innovation

Enhanced new capabilities, such as AI-driven analytics, could enable firms to uncover patterns and predict market trends, leading to more informed investment decisions. Improved risk assessment through AI-generated insights could support decision-making, whereas AI-driven research could enable better due diligence and risk minimization, ultimately leading to improved work efficiency and reduced working time of analysts (Daugherty et al. 2023). New technologies and equipment integration is also a new reality with the strong interconnection of hardware and AI, as demonstrated by the news that Bloomberg has integrated AI into its famous terminal (Sheikh 2023). New partnerships with AI technology companies could provide direct access to cutting-edge tools, while collaborations with data providers ensure access to financial information. Engaging with regulatory institutions is thereby crucial to guaranteeing that AI-driven investment practices are compliant. Following this hypothesis, new processes would be required to facilitate the adoption of AI in due diligence, risk assessment, and portfolio building. These processes, resulting from new capabilities, can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of investment strategies.

# 5.2.3.2 New proposition innovation

New offerings could arise in the form of integrating AI into investment products, leveraging AI-generated insights, or using predictions to optimize returns. AI-powered trading algorithms could analyze and act upon real-time market data, enabling high-frequency and automated trading. Moreover, GAI can be used to detect fraudulent financial transactions by identifying patterns previously hidden to human inspection (Hinkfuss 2023). This can assist financial institutions in identifying and preventing fraudulent activity. Due to the automation of tasks, new customers and new markets could be addressed with the reshaping of cost structures. Personalized investment and wealth management could be offered to a wider audience—not only would high-net-worth individuals have access, but everyone could profit from AI-driven financial planning based on insights into their preferences, financial situation, and needs. As a result of this, the new channels to offer robo-advisory services could potentially be digital—for example, in the form of apps and online platforms. Lastly, all these

# 5.2.3.3 Value capture innovation

New, or rather slightly altered, revenue models could be envisioned in the form of performance-based fees, contingent on achieving specific benchmarks, thus incentivizing investment managers to leverage AI to maximize client returns. Freemium models could expand the customer base by providing basic AI-driven investment tools free of charge while charging for premium features and services.

Value cost structure: As elaborated in new proposition innovation and in line with proposition five, operational efficiency could be enhanced by implementing AI-driven tools for research, risk assessment, due diligence, and portfolio management tasks. This would decrease operational costs with reduced needs for (entry-level) analysts while simultaneously boosting investment outcomes with better decision-making. This potentially also applies to automation, driven by utilizing AI-powered algorithms for tasks such as trading and portfolio rebalancing, which subsequently minimizes human intervention and associated labor costs. Moreover, scalability could potentially be achieved by leveraging AI to efficiently expand the availability of investment management services, accommodating a larger customer base without a significant increase in costs. Customization and personalization, utilizing AI-generated insights, could enable tailored investment strategies and financial advice, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and retention in addition to optimized resource allocation.

# 6 Limitations

First, a limitation with any kind of (generative) AI-related research attempt is the speed of development of the phenomenon. As Coldewey, a writer for TechCrunch, explains: “Writing a report on the state of AI must feel a lot like building on shifting sands—by the time you hit publish, the whole industry has changed under your feet” (Coldewey 2023). However, the continuous advancements in AI technologies and the growing influence of GAI on various industries necessitate an understanding in light of the theoretical concepts of management research. Therefore, our study takes these recent and fast-moving developments and frames them in the theoretical context of BMI, contributing to an understanding of the GAI phenomenon that will stand the test of time. However, with new developments, this view should be extended in future research which empirically analyzes the upcoming business models in this field.

Second, some of the included articles, albeit peer-reviewed, consist of the same structure: A topic is discussed with ChatGPT in a chat format and the authors merely comment and set the output into context. Although this might appear less academic, this type of research provides valuable insights into the practical application of ChatGPT and its outputs. These articles offer real-world examples of how

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

GAI can be used to generate content, and the authors’ commentary helps contextualize its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the inclusion of these articles contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the current state of AI research and demonstrates the diverse range of methodologies employed in the field. Future research can also focus on understanding the implications of GAI on research methodologies by considering academic research as an industry affected by technological developments.

Third, as with any type of qualitative scoping review, the methodology possesses certain constraints. Among these is the exclusion of publications in languages other than English and German. Another limitation is the researchers’ subjectivity in defining relevant concepts, aggregated themes, and interpreting the outcomes. Nevertheless, to mitigate subjectivity, we included a four-eye coding approach, whereby two researchers, separately from one another, analyzed the data, and interim results were discussed by the entire team of authors.

Fourth, the limited scope of the three included industries as case studies poses a selective and not generalizable sample. They were selected to cover a great variety of different sectors with varying use cases for GAI and serve only as explanatory demonstrations of the application of the BMI categories.

# 7 Conclusion

This study aims to provide a business model innovation perspective on the increasing phenomenon of GAI. To summarize the findings from the extensive scoping review, GAI is foreseen as significantly impacting business models across industries in the areas of value creation innovation, new proposition innovation, and value capture innovation.

Regarding value creation innovation (as detailed especially in proposition I, V, and VI) GAI already facilitates new capabilities, technologies, partnerships, and processes. First, the rapid advancements GAI offers are reshaping information access, content creation, and business operations, allowing freed-up time through automation and the potential restructuring of processes and departments. Second, another potential for business model innovation exists at the intersection of factual knowledge and creative thinking—companies must identify this sweet spot and be aware that if they do not fill it, another player might discover how the new capabilities can be used advantageously. Third, the most visible GAI implementations as of now are efficiency improvements made to existing products and services—often by established corporations that wish to broaden the lock-in effect of their already renowned (software) products. It remains to be seen when the “real” innovation in the form of completely novel products and services will emerge, building something from the ground-up with novel possibilities to think and solve problems with the help of GAI.

Regarding new proposition innovation (as elaborated further especially in proposition II, III, and VI), GAI can lead to new offerings, markets, channels, and customer relationships, as seen in, for example, personalized marketing campaigns and enhanced customer service experiences. GAI is expected to have the most significant impact on white-collar knowledge workers, reshaping their roles while

D. K. Kanbach et al.

simultaneously creating new opportunities. In addition, GAI redefines the skill set required to generate (almost) any type of content, with an increasing focus on critical thinking and evaluative skills—shifting the role of humans from creator to editor.

Regarding value capture innovation (as detailed further especially in propositions II, IV, and VI), GAI can drive new revenue models and cost structures, as demonstrated by reduced content production costs and novel monetization strategies—increasing the attractiveness of mass customization and freemium models with decreased marginal costs of content creation.

Ultimately, GAI will continue to evolve and permeate various industries, pushing the boundaries of what was previously thought possible. As businesses navigate this new landscape, they must adapt to the changing environment, harnessing the power of GAI to enhance their productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. The future success of businesses will also be determined by their ability to embrace GAI technologies and effectively integrate them into their existing frameworks while continually exploring new possibilities for growth and differentiation. The extent of GAI’s influence will depend on each company’s specific context and their willingness to embrace these technologies, with early adopters potentially gaining competitive advantage compared to slower market players. GAI and LLMs will undoubtedly optimize tasks, enhance human abilities, and enable enterprise reinvention—to which degree remains to be seen. However, it is clear that the rise of GAI presents a paradigm shift in the manner businesses operate and innovate. GAI has the ability to democratize access to knowledge, and capabilities to create content with zero marginal costs, thereby leveling the playing field for access to resources.

However, amid all the praise and promises of the new technology, the rapid growth of GAI presents significant challenges. Even the entrepreneurs at the forefront of AI say that caution is required. Altman (OpenAI CEO) stated that he is “(…) worried that these models could be used for large-scale disinformation, now that they’re getting better at writing code, they could be used for offensive cyber-attacks” (Ordonez, Dunn and Noll 2023). Google CEO Pichai warns against rush to deploy AI without oversight and demands “(…) strong regulations to avert harmful effects” (Love 2023) and accentuated that the development of AI should include not just engineers, but social scientists, philosophers and so on, to ensure the alignment with human values and morality (Dean 2023). Some of the main concerns are the following: ethical biases inherently rooted in the data that the large datasets were trained on could reflect historical or societal biases in the GAI such as racial or gender prejudices (Motoki et al. 2023; Youvan 2023; Zhuo et al. 2023), manipulation and disinformation scams intellectual property theft (Yurkevich 2023) and, lastly, the—for now dystopian—idea of a post-humanism area with general AI dominance. All these aspects require consideration, despite the enormous upside potential for innovation. To prevent the propagation of biased AI systems, it is crucial to implement ethical frameworks for AI development—an approach agreed upon by researchers (Goldstein et al. 2023) and companies on the forefront of AI development alike (Google 2023; OpenAI 2018; Meta AI 2023). Transparency, fairness, and inclusivity must be upheld. Mitigating the associated risks will require new policies and laws and the establishment of collaborations between countries, given the technology’s global reach. As of now, regulators often face the challenge of penalizing misuse of GAI.

# The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial…

due to legal limitations (Dwivedi et al. 2023). To ensure the human-centric focus of AI developments with the necessary degree of oversight and accountability, various institutions (e.g., OECD’s principles on artificial intelligence, OECD.AI 2023) as well as governments (e.g., the ongoing aims to establish new regulations of the US government (Shepardson and Bartz 2023), or the temporary ChatGPT ban issued by the Italian government (Mukherjee et al. 2023)) are currently trying to ensure the uphold of societal values in light of AI’s rapid expansion. As society and businesses alike navigate this complex mix of opportunities and challenges at the advent of this new technology, it becomes apparent that GAI stands to become a game-changer, ready to spark a new era of innovative prowess and entrepreneurial vigor.

This will also impact further research in the management domain. Given the novelty of the topic this study can only provide a first, mainly hypothetical view on how GAI will impact business models and trigger innovations along the value chain of businesses. Therefore, future research endeavors should include empirical approaches, analyzing measurable effects on businesses, with e.g., companies’ performance and/or the degree of measurable business model innovation as the dependent variable of the studies. Additionally, longitudinal study designs are required to understand the evolution of GAI over time and its evolving impact on business models.

# Socially Irresponsible and Illegal Behavior and Shareholder Wealth

# A Meta-Analysis of Event Studies

# JEFF FROOMAN

# University of Pittsburgh

This article provides empirical results indicating that acting in a socially responsible and lawful manner is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for increasing shareholder wealth: It meta-analyzes 27 event studies that have measured the stock market's reaction to incidences of socially irresponsible and illicit behavior: It finds that for firms engaging in socially irresponsible & illicit behavior; the effect on shareholder wealth is negative (wealth decreases), statistically significant (p < .001), and so substantial in size (D = -932) that the distribution of abnormal returns is shifted nearly a full standard deviation to the left (i.e., negatively) from their expected standard normal distribution. This results in a socially responsible and law-abiding manner: It also provides support for a moral position called enlightened self-interest; which prescribes that firms should act in a socially responsible manner to promote the shareholders' interests.

Business and society scholars have spent decades wrestling with the economic assumption that people are rationally self-interested and try to maximize their personal welfare, especially in terms of monetary wealth. The problem is simple: If this is so, why would any business choose to be socially responsible, assuming that social responsibility costs a firm more than irresponsibility? Enlightened self-interested arguments for corporate.

Social responsibility (CSR) have focused on the long-term benefits of socially responsible behavior; benefits such as greater customer and employee loyalty, less regulation, and a more supportive external environment (e.g., Baumol, 1970; Committee for Economic Development; 1971; Steiner; 1972). Moral arguments have focused on the philosophical justifications for right behavior; with or without regard to consequences (e.g., Kant; 1785/1981; Mill, 1863/1992). Stakeholder arguments have focused on contractual and interest-based reasons for CSR (Clarkson; 1995; Evan and Freeman; 1988; Freeman; 1991). None of these positions, however, has generated convincing data in support of social responsibility. Furthermore, finance and economics research has been assumed to discount and discredit the CSR concept.

In this article, however, I show that empirical support for CSR is found in a surprising context: the finance literature based on the event study methodology. A meta-analysis of 27 event studies using CSR-related and law-related events yields the conclusion that socially irresponsible and illegal corporate acts result in substantial unrecovered decreases in shareholder wealth. This finding gives empirical weight to an enlightened self-interest argument for CSR and shows that markets do recognize and account for downstream costs (tangible and intangible) to the firm of socially irresponsible and unlawful behavior.

Enlightened self-interest as a reason for corporations to act in a socially responsible and lawful manner was developed by CSR theorists, including such researchers as Baumol (1970), Wallich and McGowan (1970), Committee for Economic Development (1971), Steiner (1972), and Davis (1973). In the words of the Committee for Economic Development (1971: 27), for instance, the doctrine of enlightened self-interest calls for "corporations to promote the public welfare in a positive way" because this is in the long-term interest of firms and shareholders.

Thus, the maxim of enlightened self-interest, as defined by these theorists, could be simply stated as:

- Proposition I: Firms ought to act in a socially responsible and lawful manner to increase shareholder wealth.

Proposition I is not a causal statement as in "A causes B:" It is simply a logical statement of the form "A implies B." That is, if firms act in a socially responsible and lawful manner, then shareholder wealth will increase. Ultimately, the field of business and society would like to support Proposition I. Empirically, however, no consistent support has been found for the proposition that CSR and lawful behavior are a sufficient condition.

for increasing shareholder wealth: However; there are data available ~the results of event studies -the nature of which lends itself to supporting a proposition that, ceteris paribus, CSR and lawful behavior are a necessary condition for increasing shareholder wealth. Of course, other factors can be assigned a role in generating shareholder wealth without detracting from the necessity of CSR and lawful behavior: This leads to the second proposition:

# Proposition 2

If firms do not act in a socially responsible and lawful manner; shareholder wealth is not increased.

Proposition 2 is a weak statement of the relationship between CSR, legal behavior; and shareholder wealth: It is also difficult to test empirically. Not acting in a socially responsible manner could mean acting irresponsibly, or it could mean acting in some "neutral" way that is not assessed within a responsibility/irresponsibility framework. Likewise, to say that shareholder wealth is not increased could be to say that shareholder wealth stays the same or decreases. Empirically, a workable test of Proposition 2 would be to assume that not acting in a socially responsible manner is equivalent to acting in a socially irresponsible manner; and then testing to see if shareholder wealth decreases. This leads to the third proposition:

# Proposition 3

If firms act in a socially irresponsible or illegal manner; shareholder wealth is decreased.

Although Proposition 3 is an oversimplification of reality, its strong grammatical form yields a conservative approach to testing indirectly the fundamental idea expressed in Proposition 2.

In short; the article presents an empirical analysis of the effects of socially irresponsible and illicit behavior on shareholder wealth, the results of which indicate that; ceteris paribus, Proposition 3 is a true statement. In other words, all other things equal, socially responsible and lawful behavior is necessary, though not sufficient; for shareholder wealth to be increased.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

Of course, in one sense, a meta-analysis might be thought of as an empirical literature review because it quantitatively summarizes the re-

Results of previously published works. In this sense, the rest of this article might be seen as a lengthy literature review. However, this article does focus its attention exclusively on the results of only one type of previously published work—event studies. Event studies, though, are a very recent phenomena, and researchers have been looking at the link between social and financial (including market) performance for quite some time. Indeed, as far back as the early 1970s, Milton Moskowitz (1972) called for empirical proof to verify the commonly held belief that economic incentives could be used to motivate companies to be socially responsible.

During the 1970s and much of the 1980s, researchers published some 50 studies answering his call (Wood and Jones, 1995). The studies all sought a correlation between financial performance variables (e.g., accounting data, investor returns data, and risk data) and corporate social responsibility variables (e.g., existence and type of social programs; pollution performance, and reputation variables). Two previous review articles (Arlow and Gannon, 1982; Ullmann, 1985) that looked at many of these empirical studies found the results to be inconsistent; these two review articles, however, were done before anyone had begun applying event study methodology to the issue.

Event studies focus on a particular type of event—product recalls, for instance—and try to determine whether the stock market responds to the news of the event. In other words, at the time of a recall, does anything abnormal happen to the share price of a recalling firm, relative to how other stocks in the same risk class were performing at that time? To test for such "abnormal" behavior, event studies examine the effects of an event on many companies, never a single one. For example, an event study that considers the market's response to government-mandated automobile recalls (e.g., Bromiley and Marcus, 1989) does not look at a single recall by a single company on a single date. Rather, it looks at many recalls by all the companies in the industry over the course of many years. The sample of recalls is then statistically evaluated to see if across the sample the market reacted in a consistent manner (e.g., decreasing the value of firms recalling).

The theory underlying these event studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, originally proposed by Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969). The methodology was developed mainly by Fama (1970, 1976) and further refined by Brown and Warner (1980, 1985) and Dodd and Warner (1983). Meta-analysis is a quantitative review method used to synthesize the findings of previous empirical studies on an issue. Meta-analysis treats the results of each study it examines as a single data point. Because this article examines 27 event studies that have used incidences of socially responsible events...

data points. The technique of meta-analysis dates back as far as the 1930s, but it was not until the 1980s that social science researchers (e.g-, Glass, Jackson, 1982) began to refine the statistical techniques for their uses. The most up-to-date work on meta-analysis can be found in the edited volume by Cooper and Hedges (1994), which includes the approach to meta-procedures include a technique for meta-analyzing multilevel independent variables (Nouri and Greenberg, 1995), a technique for identifying outliers in data sets comprising correlation coefficients (Huffcutt and Arthur; 1995), and a technique for comparing the results of two meta-analyses using independent data sets (Alliger; 1995).

By meta-analyzing the results of event studies using socially irresponsible and illegal actions as their events, this article significantly extends the work of Arlow and Gannon (1982) and Ullmann (1985). This article is the first to collect event studies involving socially irresponsible and illegal behavior and the first to meta-analyze their results. It finds that; together, the 27 event studies produce a statistically significant result, indicating that substantial losses accrue to the shareholders of irresponsible and unlawful firms. In short; the wealth of shareholders does decrease when companies engage in socially irresponsible and illegal behavior;

# THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF A FIRM'S BEHAVIOR ON ITS STOCK PRICE

Although event studies may gauge the market's reaction only during the few days preceding and following reports of some action taken by a firm; the effect of the market's reaction to an event is not short-term in nature. Financial economists believe that any action taken by a firm permanently affects the value of that firm's stock (Brealey and Myers, 1996; Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe, 1996).

Recall that share prices reflect the opinion of market participants regarding a firm's future cash flows. If participants believe that the future cash flows of a firm will decrease due to some behavior of the firm; demand for the stock will decrease, thus lowering the value of the stock. Later; if they believe that future cash flows will increase due to some new behavior of the firm; demand for the stock will increase, and this increased demand will drive up the value of the stock.

But the resulting final value

of the stock will not be as high as it would have been if the stock had not lost value previously. Consider this simplified example: Initially (time t), market participants determine that the stock of firm F is worth $80 a share. (That is, the discounted value of the future cash flows divided by the number of outstanding shares equals $80.) The firm engages in some action A at time t1, and market participants conclude the action will decrease future cash flows by 10%. When they recalculate share price based on these lower future cash flows, they find that F should only sell for $72, that is, 80 (80 x 10%) = 72 per share. (A stable discount rate is assumed throughout this example.) If a rough consensus for F is that it is overpriced, then drops to around $72. (Abnormal demand for F declines, and its price negative returns will be recorded during this drop.) Some time later; at time t2, F engages in some action B. Market participants believe this action will increase F's future cash flows by 15%. The participants recalculate share price and find that firm F should sell for $82.80, that is, 72 (72 x 15%) = 82.80 per share. We would now expect to see positive abnormal returns on F as its stock climbs to around $82.80. Firm F's shares would have been worth $92, that is, 80 + (80 x 15%) = 92. The point, then, is that if F had not committed action A at t1 then at t2, firm F's stock will be worth less than it would have been if F had not taken the action A at t1.

# METHODOLOGY

Because this article is not an event study but rather a meta-analysis of the article. First, there is an explanation of how the articles meta-analyzed in this article were selected, and then there is a description of which data were used from them: Finally, there is a review of the actual statistical tests that were applied to the data. An explanation of event study methodology appears in the Appendix:

# Selection of Studies

The following two subsections are concerned, respectively, with two issues: (a) the method used for finding event studies for possible inclusion in this meta-analysis sample and (b) the definition of a CSR event and how it was used to establish inclusion/exclusion criteria for the sample.

Downloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

The 27 studies ultimately selected and meta-analyzed in this article are summarized in Table 1.

Search procedure. Searches for event studies were conducted using electronic databases, including ABLINFORM, INFOTRAC, LEXIS, and PERI. An extensive manual search, making use of the reference lists of each event study, was also done to find additional event studies. Because there may be a bias among journal editors to print studies producing significant results, a special effort during the manual search phase was devoted toward finding yet-unpublished studies or studies appearing in conference proceedings. (Only a few of these studies, though, ultimately ended up passing the inclusion/exclusion criteria.) Each event study found during the search procedure was considered for inclusion in this article's meta-analysis, based on whether illegal behavior was involved and based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria generated from the definition of a CSR event; as given below.

# Definition of a CSR event

Because this article uses the results of event studies as its data, it defines CSR in terms of "events." The definition is given below. Within that definition can be found inclusion/exclusion criteria for deciding which event studies ought to be meta-analyzed here. The definition of a CSR event that this study uses is based on similar ones found in the business ethics literature defining moral issues and actions. A CSR event is:

- An action by a firm, which the firm chooses to take, that substantially affects an identifiable social stakeholder's welfare.

In the paragraphs that follow, this definition will be unpacked for meaning: It has five components, and each will be explained. It will also be shown how in each case the five parts of the definition form, in essence, the criteria for determining whether a study's event is a CSR event and therefore whether the study ought to be included in or excluded from this meta-analysis.

# An action by a firm

The first phrase in the definition indicates that CSR events must stem from actors that are firms and not governmental units. The purpose of this part of the definition is to put this meta-analysis squarely into the realm of corporate social responsibility and out of the public policy realm. In other words, the focus of this meta-analysis is on the market's response to the actions of corporations, not the actions of governmental units.

market is responding to a public policy action; in the latter case, corporations are the actors, and the market is responding to a socially irresponsible action: Furthermore, it should be noted that when a firm has broken the law, the following sequence of actions will have occurred: the action by the firm, the reaction by the regulator; and the report by the press. It is clear that nominally, the action the market responds to is either the reaction by the regulator or the report by the press. However, the underlying action this meta-analysis, such as the one on firms breaking tax laws, involves events in which the first cause is a firm's action, even though a regulator's reaction may be involved at some other point in the causal chain.

Which the firm chooses to take. The second phrase in the definition of a CSR event indicates that the actor must act out of choice, that is, with both freedom of will and willful purpose. In other words, for an actor to be a moral agent; there must be volition (Jones, 1991; Velasquez, 1992) and intention (French; 1986; Mackie, 1977). As a result, an event study that used airplane crashes (Bruning and Kuzma, 1989) as its event was not included in this meta-analysis because, as these authors observed, airplane crashes are frequently the result of bad weather or pilot error; In such cases choice is not involved. On the other hand, a study that examined FAA airline safety violations involving fines (Block, 1991) was included in this meta-analysis. The assumption here is that safety regulations are knowable and achievable by airline companies, and safety violations of some level involve an explicit or implicit decision on the part of management to not give safety observance the priority—that is, the energy, time, and money—it needs.

That substantially affects. Although substantial effect is rightfully part of the CSR event definition; it did not turn out to be a useful criterion for accepting or rejecting event studies for this meta-analysis. Basically, all studies found during the search procedure met this requirement—no researchers of event study examined actions that had insubstantial effects. The reasons for this seem obvious: First, such actions would be uninteresting to study, and second, if they were not of substantial effect they would not be newsworthy, and so there would be no data available on them.

An identifiable social stakeholder is. By identifiable, this part of the CSR event definition states that if the set of people being harmed by an action is actually an empty set, then no harm is being done. This notion.

that someone must be harmed for harm to have occurred can be located in the works of many philosophers (see, e.g-, Hobbes's [1651/1994] discussion of the justice of action versus the justice of manners and Mill's [1863/1992] discussions of justice and its 'ingredients'). By social stakeholder, I mean to draw the distinction between social and economic groups that the very phrase corporate social responsibility draws. In other words, I do not mean studying whether a firm is being economically responsible that is, generating wealth for its shareholders and creditors, for instance. Rather; I wish to direct attention at social stakeholders, such as communities, consumers, employees, and the environment.

For example, the investment advisory service, Value Line, ranks firms for timeliness based on predicted short-term price performance. An event study that investigated the market's response to Value Line's timeliness ratings (Affleck-Graves and Mendenhall, 1992) sought to determine how investors were being affected by the ratings. This was not of interest to this study because a social stakeholder's welfare did not seem to be at stake. However; an event study that examines the market's response to pollution ratings issued by the Council on Economic Priorities (Shane and Spicer; 1983) is of interest to this meta-analysis. It was included in this study because the many diverse stakeholders of a firm certainly include environmental activist groups (Freeman, 1984) whose welfare could be identified as being affected by firms' pollution performance. Furthermore, many would identify the natural environment itself as a stakeholder whose welfare would be directly affected by a firm's pollution performance.

# Welfare

The final component of the CSR event definition has to do with people's welfare being affected. As James Rest (1986) has noted, ultimately for a situation or an event to be a moral issue, actions involved ethicists would argue that whether someone's welfare is being affected must have consequences affecting someone's welfare. Indeed, business lies at the very core of ethics and social responsibility (e.g, Hosmer; 1994). Therefore, a study that examined the market reaction to the "purely cosmetic change" of a company splitting its stock (Lamoureux and Poon; 1987: 1347) was not of interest to this meta-analysis. However; a study that examined the market's reaction to a company recalling products that is, defective or dangerous for consumers (Jarrell and Peltzman, 1985) was included in this meta-analysis. Thirty event studies were found to either fit the above definition or involve illegal behavior.

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

irresponsible and illegal behavior (actions where welfare is affected negatively), two studies (Meznar; Nigh, ad Kwok, 1994; Patten, 1990) from South Africa (ostensibly socially responsible behavior) were not included. Another study (Rubin; Murphy, and Jarrell, 1988) was excluded because it failed to provide a piece of critical data needed for this meta-analysis (i.e., the value of the t statistic from their hypothesis test). This left 27 event studies, with a total of 2,161 incidents of socially irresponsible or illegal behavior to be meta-analyzed. These 27 studies are grouped by their events in Table 2, which shows how each study fits the inclusionary/exclusionary requirements.

Finally, it should also be noted that this meta-analysis excluded from its sample those event studies using monthly return data (typically written in the 1970s and early 1980s). As Brown and Warner (1985) showed, such coarse analyses were not very dependable because too much noise could be picked up in an event month besides the effect of an event itself:

# Data Analyzed

Most meta-analyses make use of correlation coefficients (e.g., Cohen, 1993; Damanpour; 1991; Williams and Livingstone, 1994). Event studies do not; however; produce correlation coefficients. This makes the methodology of this article different from most other meta-analyses. Event studies produce two numbers of interest: test statistic values and size-of-return data. However, as will be explained, size-of-return data cannot be used. Indeed, anyone meta-analyzing event studies will be forced to perform the meta-analysis on test statistic values. The following two subsections explain why the test statistic values are used and why the return sizes reported in the event studies cannot be used. The data used in the meta-analysis are presented in Table 3.

# Why test statistic values can be used

Every event study employs hypothesis tests to see if abnormal returns around the event day are significant: Such hypothesis testing makes use of either the student's t distribution or the standard normal (z) distribution. Of the 27 events included in this meta-analysis, 15 reported t-statistic values, 9 reported z-statistic values, and 3 studies reported p values. The z's were directly changed into t's on the assumption that as sample size increases, the student's t distribution approaches the normal distribution (Marascuilo and Serlin; 1988). This was done for those studies in the meta-analysis.

Note. Number of events in meta-analysis: N = 27. Total number of incidents of socially irresponsible behavior: n = 2,161.

Table 3 numbered 3,4,16,19,20,22,24,26, and 27. Because Studies 16, 22, 24, and 26 all had sample sizes above 100, this was a reasonable change to have made. The conversion of zS into ts for Studies 3 and 19 was a bit more tenuous because these studies had sample sizes of 49 and 32, respectively. And because the conversion for Studies 4, 20, and 27 (with sample sizes of 17, 10, and 5) was even more questionable, the statistical tests were run with a sample of 18 (all the studies using t statistics originally) and with a sample of 22 (the 18 studies that used ts plus the 4 studies that had used zs but had samples of over 100). The results of these runs were almost identical to the results of the full sample of 27 and are reported in the Results section below:

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

Three of the studies (5,15,23) reported p values, but not ts O zs. The pS were converted into ts by using a t table and the appropriate degrees of freedom: Studies 15 and 23 did not give exact p values and instead merely indicated that the data were significant at a Type I error rate of less than .05 and .01, respectively. For these two studies, t values were taken off the student's t table by assuming the pS were exactly .05 and .01.

In short, ts could be obtained for each study, and these ts became the metric on which all the statistical analyses were based, as will be explained in the Analysis section below.

# Why size-of-return data cannot be used

Besides producing test statistics, event studies also produce size-of-return data. Davidson and Worrell (1992), for example, showed that during the 3 days surrounding their event (nonautomobile recalls), firms lost on average .0238 of their value: In other words, the average abnormal size-of-return was a negative 2.39.

Although intuitively it might seem reasonable to base the meta-analysis on such size-of-return data, such an analysis cannot be done for two reasons. First, about one third of event studies only compute average abnormal returns (AARs), another third compute only cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs), and about a third compute both. Therefore, meta-analyzing size-of-return data would clearly lead to complications because AARs and CAARs are different metrics for measuring returns.

Second, in meta-analyzing size-of-return data one would need to standardize the returns by their standard deviations (Rosenthal, 1994). Unfortunately, almost no event studies report these standard deviations. For these reasons, then, the meta-analysis had to be performed on the test statistics.

In addition, because of these problems with size-of-return data, this study did not use the replication method of meta-analysis. The replication method was used by the only other known meta-analysis of event studies (Datta, Pinches, and Narayanan, 1992). In that meta-analysis, the authors used a regression model with size-of-return data as their dependent variable. However, as just noted, because the size-of-return data collected for this meta-analysis come in two different metrics, the possibility of them being used as a variable in this study is precluded. The method of meta-analysis that this article does use is explained below.

# Analysis

This article makes use of a direct weighted linear combination of estimators method of meta-analysis, developed by Hedges and Olkin (1985). They developed a testing procedure for a fixed-effects categorical data.

model, such as the one this study fits. The test procedure employs Hedges's g, a commonly used effect size estimator; that makes use of t statistics and sample sizes the only two pieces of data this study could make use of. (Throughout this article, an n will represent the sample sizes of the event studies meta-analyzed. It will range from 5 to 535, as Table 3 indicates. An N will represent the sample size of the meta-analysis itself; typically, N=27. Hedges's g has a chi-squared distribution and is defined by the following formula (Rosenthal, 1994: 238):

g = 2tVn

Studies of Hedges's g, however; have shown it to have a small sample bias, and because this meta-analysis has several studies with very small sample sizes, the estimator d was used to correct for the bias (Hedges and Olkin, 1985: 81):

d = 1 - An - 9 g3

The variance of the estimator d is given by the formula:

var(d) = n -1n 2n

which is the two-sample variance formula modified because the event studies meta-analyzed here are one-sample studies. The two-sample formula is var(d) = [(n' + nTntn] + d/2n" 2n7, where n' is the sample size of the experimental group, and nf is the sample size of the control group. Taking n' + nf = n, the single-sample formula is obtained by setting nf = 1, the smallest positive integer for n' possible, because setting nf = 0 in the two-sample formula will produce an undefined result (Rosenthal, 1994: 238).

It should be mentioned here that this meta-analysis makes no attempt to weight the studies on quality. There are two reasons for this. First; weighting schemes that involve weighting for anything other than sample size (accomplished in this meta-analysis by Hedges's g and they should be applied with caution and viewed as are not recommended: primarily exploratory in nature" (Shadish and Haddock; 1994: 264).

Second; because event study methodology was standardized by the early to mid-1980s, it can be argued that all the studies meta-analyzed here are roughly equivalent in quality: Three procedures were followed for analyzing the data: a test for homogeneity, a test for significance, and a computation of effect size.

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

Perform these procedures, Hedges and Olkin (1985: 163) give computational formulas, intended to facilitate computer programming, involving the ds and their variances. (Essentially, the sums of the reciprocals of the variances are used to weight the effect sizes.) The components of these sections are the following:

- TW = total of weights (reciprocals of the variances) X[Ivar(d)]
- TWD = total of weighted ds = Z[dlvar(d)]
- TWDS = total of weighted d squares = E[dIvar(d)]

# Test for homogeneity

If the underlying population of effect sizes is not the same across all the studies, then any attempt to group the effect sizes and analyze them will be questionable. A test for homogeneity is needed to determine if indeed the effect sizes could be coming from the same population. Only if the null hypothesis that the data are homogeneous is retained is it possible to proceed to a test for significance and to the calculation of a single estimate of effect magnitude. The general procedure to be used for a fixed-effects model for which observed effect sizes are being combined from a series of independent studies is explained succinctly in Shadish and Haddock (1994: 265-68). The specific procedure used in this meta-analysis is described in much more detail in Hedges and Olkin (1985: 147-65).

# The test statistic (TS) for homogeneity

Recommended by Hedges and Olkin (1985) is chi-square distributed, with degrees of freedom equal to N - 1. The test statistic and procedure are based on a total weighted sum of squares method (with effect sizes being weighted by the reciprocals of their variances), given by Hedges and Olkin as:

(TS) = E_d var(d) / (var(d) 2 - 1 var(d))

OT, in its computational form; as:

(TS) = TWDS - (TWD)² / TW

# Test for significance

The null hypothesis for this test is that the population effect size, D, is zero. The test for significance is performed on the weighted grand mean or the weighted average effect size over.

studies. The weighted grand mean, @dlva(dV[EIvar(d)J, is standardized by its standard error of estimate [ElIvar(d)]-I, This gives the following formula (Hedges and Olkin; 1985: 152):

(TS)z =X- varld) Z_1d  var(d)

Or; in its computational form, as

(TS)z  = TWDX (TW)-h,.

The large sample distribution of this statistic is standard normally distributed.

# Estimate of effect size

The best estimator of effect size is the weighted grand mean, [Edlvar(dJ[ELvar(d)]. It is the best estimator in the sense that it has the smallest variance of linearly weighted estimates and is "also precise in a larger class of estimators of effect size that includes those that are not weighted linear combinations of the d" (Hedges ad Olkin; 1985: 114,153). The formula for the estimator is the following:

Or, in its computational form, as

# RESULTS

The results of the test for homogeneity, test for significance, and the estimate of effect size are all summarized in Table 4. In addition to the analysis of the full 27 studies and the four other samples mentioned above, a sample containing only those event studies reflecting socially irresponsible behavior and a sample containing only those event studies reflecting illegal behavior were also analyzed. The following subsections interpret the homogeneity, significance, and effect size results for all seven of these samples.

# Test for Homogeneity

The homogeneity test for the full sample of 27 event studies resulted in a test statistic value of (TS)2 = 16.322. The critical value for acceptance rejection of the null hypothesis for df = 26, and a Type I error rate of .05 is 38.9. This means that the null hypothesis of the data being homogeneous is retained, indicating that the event studies do indeed share a common population effect size. Homogeneity allows this meta-analysis to proceed to a test for significance and to an estimate of effect size. Homogeneity tests on the other samples - the sample of studies that reported AARs, the sample of studies that reported only CAARs, the sample of studies that based significance on t distributions, the sample of studies that used z distributions or used z distributions but had large samples, the sample of illegal actions, and the sample of irresponsible actions - also produced test statistics indicating homogeneity (see Table 4).

# Test for Significance

For the full sample of 27 event studies, the value of the test statistic for the significance test; (TS)z = -4.648 (p < .0001), makes it clear that the null hypothesis that the population effect size is zero can be rejected (at p < .05). The significance tests on the other six samples, as reported in Table 4, also permit us to reject the null hypothesis.

# Estimate of Effect Size

The full sample of 27 event studies shows an effect size estimate of D = -0.932, or approximately one full (negative) standard deviation difference between the distributions of the normal and abnormal returns. So, on average, abnormal returns were a full standard deviation below expected normal (i.e., zero) returns. Or, in other words, one could think of the AARs and CAARs as typically having a distribution centered around zero, but on and around the event day one could think of the distribution of those AARs and CAARs as having a distribution shifted a full standard deviation to the left of zero - that is, indicating significantly negative abnormal returns. In a sense, then, socially irresponsible and illicit behavior decreases abnormal returns by a full standard deviation. The 95% confidence interval for the effect size is given by the following formula (Hedges and Olkin; 1985: 8):

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

=(Zonz Xod) < D<d+ (Zon Oa), where Zon is the two-tailed critical value of the standard normal distribution. In this meta-analysis, then; the confidence interval of the effect size estimator is _. 93 _ (1.96)(.20) < D< -.93 + (1.96)(.20), which simplifies to -1.32<D< -.54. This means quite simply that we can be 95% confident that the difference between the distribution of the abnormal returns and the normal returns is at least ~. 54 standard deviation units and may be as much as -1.32 standard deviation units. Without any clear standards existing in the event study methodology with which to evaluate an effect size of approximately -1 standard deviation unit, one is forced to fall back on Cohen and Cohen's (1983 rule of thumb for interpreting effect sizes: d = .2 (small effect), d = .5 (medium effect), and d = .8 (large effect). Effect sizes from _.93 to -1.32 are quite substantial, then, and even an effect size as small as _.54 (the upper limit of the confidence interval) still shows that socially irresponsible and illicit behavior can have a moderate effect on abnormal returns.

Ds were also calculated under all the various assumptions indicated in Table 4 and ranged from D = -683 (for the sample of studies using irresponsible behavior as their events) to D = -1.201 (for the sample of studies using CAARs). The average D for these seven meta-analysis samples reported in Table 4 is -.912, which reflects as large an effect as the full sample of 27 event studies.

# DISCUSSION

From the test for significance it is clear that abnormal returns are significant and negative across the studies. These event studies are showing that shareholder wealth is decreased when firms act in a socially irresponsible or illegal manner; This supports Proposition 3, suggesting that acting in a socially responsible and law-abiding manner can be seen as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for increasing shareholder wealth, all other things equal. This would suggest, then, that the maxim (Proposition 1) of enlightened self-interest may indeed serve the shareholder's interests. In addition, the effect size is substantial ~approximately a full standard deviation unit; This means that the distribution of abnormal returns, which is expected to be centered around zero (i.e., generally no abnormal returns).

are expected), is shifted dramatically to the negative side of zero. A shift to the left in the distribution of abnormal returns by a full standard deviation indicates a strong negative effect on shareholder wealth.

For theorists, these results lend support to the normative ethical position of enlightened self-interest. It supplies those doing research in business ethics and corporate social responsibility with empirical results showing that social responsibility does indeed have a role to play in business. These results also present a self-interested reason to practitioners to be socially responsible and law abiding: Such a self-interested reason seems needed due to the simple fact that no other reason has worked or may ever work. Christopher Stone (1975), for instance, pointed out in a chapter titled Why the Law Can't Do It that the legal system is best at enforcing minimum behavior—in a sense, preventing people from being bad—but Mancur Olson (1965) showed why calls for socially responsible cooperation may fail due to the free rider problem. In short; maybe a self-interested, economic argument is the only argument that may work. Thomas Schelling (1978) has observed that self-interest has succeeded at motivating people to be good at times when the law, social contracting, the golden rule, and other moral arguments have all failed. The argument supported here—that socially responsible and law-abiding behavior is a necessary condition for increasing shareholder wealth—is one argument that can be directed at economically self-interested firms.

To continue building the case in favor of socially responsible behavior; additional work still needs to be done by researchers regarding event studies. The rest of this section poses three questions to guide such research:

One question future research ought to address is whether the market rewards socially responsible and law-abiding behavior. This article meta-analyzed studies looking only at whether shareholder wealth was affected by firms engaging in socially irresponsible and illegal behavior: This was done because this was essentially the data that were available. (The 27 studies of irresponsible and illicit behavior constitute a reasonable sample size for meta-analysis.) Only 3 studies have examined the effects on shareholder wealth of socially responsible behavior; and 3 studies do not represent a large enough sample for meta-analysis. Of the 3 studies, Shane and Spicer (1983) found that there were significantly negative abnormal returns for companies that were given bad pollution ratings and that there were significantly positive abnormal returns for companies receiving good pollution ratings.

on the shareholder wealth of firms withdrawing from South Africa (Meznar et al, 1994) or adopting the Sullivan Principles (Patten; 1990), found no significant effects. Both studies noted that using actions toward South Africa as an event presented this complication: Arguments were made in the CSR literature demonstrating that remaining in South Africa was socially responsible. So was socially irresponsible, but other arguments in the CSR literature although it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these three studies as a group; their existence indicates that it is at least possible to conduct event studies focused on socially responsible events. I believe that more such event studies are called for; and at some future date a meta-analysis of socially responsible behavior and its effects on shareholder wealth would be warranted.

The second question that future research needs to concern itself with is how the magnitude of the abnormal returns relates to the size of any costs absorbed by the firms. The theoretical literature suggests that the size of the abnormal returns ought to be tied closely to the size of the costs a company must pay to rectify a socially irresponsible act. Only eight of the event studies, however, tried to find a correlation between the size of the abnormal returns and the magnitude of remedial costs (e.g., court costs, damages, lost goodwill) firms incur. Five of these eight studies (Studies 9, 11, 14, 21, and 24 in Table 1) showed no systematic relationship between remedial costs and abnormal returns. One study (27), however, did find that the size of the abnormal returns correlated to the added costs of more stringent regulations that were passed in response to the irresponsible behavior: Two studies (5, 22) tested whether the magnitude of the penalty imposed by the market was related to the magnitude of the firms' irresponsible behavior and found that indeed the most irresponsible companies were penalized the most.

Clearly this is not enough evidence to conclude anything, and so correlating the size of the market penalty in dollar-per-share terms to the abnormal returns is something for all future CSR event studies to consider doing. A final question researchers still need to address is this: The market does appear to be reacting to the socially irresponsible and illicit behavior of firms in such a way that shareholder wealth decreases. If we were to think of this as a penalty absorbed by shareholders, we might ask whether the market is imposing the penalty in response to the socially irresponsible and illegal behavior of the firms (in which case the market's action would be ethical in nature), or whether it is imposing the penalty in response to the bad news and its potential to decrease expected future income streams (in which case the market's action would be economic in nature).

Whichever the answer turns out to be, though whether ethical or economic we can say that based on this meta-analysis, the shareholder wealth of firms engaging in socially irresponsible or illicit behavior is decreasing: In other words, even if we do not know why the shareholders are losing wealth, this meta-analysis shows that they are. And, as a result, we can still say that Proposition 3 holds true, that socially responsible and lawful behavior is necessary, though not sufficient; for shareholder wealth to be increased.

So despite the need for further research; this meta-analysis does indicate that socially responsible and illicit behavior is necessary (though not sufficient) to increase shareholder wealth, all other things equal. That the shareholder wealth of those firms engaging in irresponsible or illegal behavior does decrease finally gives economically self-interested firms a self-interested motive for being socially responsible and law abiding:

# Event Study Methodology

Event studies focus on a particular type of event—product recalls, for example—and try to determine whether the stock market responds to the news of the event; In other words, does anything "abnormal" happen to a company's stock when the company makes a recall? The theory underlying event studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, which argues that modern financial markets are information efficient. The markets can anticipate and correctly interpret news about a security and adjust the price of the security very quickly to reflect that news (Fama et al., 1969). Although most researchers agree now that financial markets are not "information perfect" in their performance, they do work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy (Holthausen, Leftwich, and Mayers, 1990). The methodology for event studies became standardized by the mid-1980s, before most of the CSR event studies meta-analyzed here had even been done. (This standardization served to facilitate this meta-analysis because it ensured that the results of the studies are roughly comparable, that is, homogeneous.)

This article includes only a brief summary of event study methodology that centers on the use of two key concepts: abnormal returns and average abnormal returns.

# Abnormal Returns (ARs)

Abnormal returns accrue when a stock outperforms the market. So when a stock earns significantly greater positive or negative returns than other stocks in the market, it is considered to have abnormal returns.

# Frooman MTA-ANALYSIS 245

According to the market model and its equation for calculating abnormal returns, its risk class, it is earning abnormal returns. Abnormal returns can be computed (Fama et al, 1969). An abnormal return can be defined as:

Abnormal Return = Actual Return - Expected Return,

Or, in mathematical terms, as:

ARit = Rit - E(Ri),

where ARit = the abnormal return for security i in time period t, Rit = the actual return for security i in time period t, and E(Ri) = the expected return for security i in time period t.

It should be noted here that E(ARi) = 0; that is, on average we expect a firm's abnormal returns to be zero - we expect nothing abnormal to be happening to a firm's returns (unless of course, as will be explained, something abnormal is happening to the firm). The expected return for individual stock i can be determined first by regressing its returns against the return of a market portfolio (e.g., the S&P 500) and calculating the slope (beta) and vertical intercept (αi) of that function. Then, given the return of the market portfolio on any given day (Rmt), the expected return for a stock can be calculated according to the market model:

E(i) = αi + βiRmt

where βi = the beta for security i (a constant), and Rmt = the actual return for the market portfolio (e.g., S&P 500) in time period t.

# Average Abnormal Returns (AARs)

The key to event study methodology is that it examines not just one action but rather many actions simultaneously. Put another way, an event study on automobile recalls would not look at only one recall made by Chrysler Corporation in August 1986, for instance, but rather at all recalls made by Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors between 1980 and 1989, for example. Thus, an average abnormal return could be calculated as:

AARt = (ΣARi) / n,

where AAR = the average abnormal return in time period t for all the events involved, and n = the number of events in the study. Standard hypothesis testing is used on the average abnormal returns for each day in the event window. If the market reacts specially to events, then the average abnormal return will be significantly different from zero. Finally, it should be noted here that 11 studies used a variation of this standard methodology and ended up computing cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs): This methodology is explained in detail in Dodd and Warner (1983).

# NOTES

1. The logic of my argument is as follows:

First the statements:

1. A: Firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner:
2. B: Shareholder wealth is increased.

Enlightened self-interest theorists argue:

1. A 5 B (i.e., if firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner; then shareholder wealth is increased.)

We have no data to substantiate (3) but argue that we can show A is a necessary condition for B, that is:

1. B > A (i.e., if shareholder wealth is increased, then firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner.)

The contrapositive of (4) that is, a logical equivalent of (4) is:

1. ~A → ~B (i.e., if firms did not act in a socially responsible and lawful manner; then shareholder wealth is not increased)

We focus our attention on this proposition because of the nature of the data, which are data on the effects of socially irresponsible behavior on shareholder wealth.

2. Event studies presume that the market finds out about the irresponsible behavior; it is possible that some firms engaging in illegal or irresponsible behavior succeed in concealing that behavior and would thus never become the subject of an event study.

# Determinants of corporate sustainability performance – evidence from Brazilian panel data

# Vicente Lima Crisostomo, Fatima de Souza Freire and Maria Rafaela De Oliveira Freitas

# Abstract

Purpose – Over the past two decades, there has been an increasing interest on corporate social responsibility by a number of constituencies – corporate managers, research scholars, policymakers and investors. In this context, corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has been a central focus of attention. This paper aims to analyze CSP determinants in Brazil, an important emerging market. Firm CSP is proxied by the membership to the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) which comprises environmental, social, economic and governance issues.

Design/methodology/approach – Logit panel data models are estimated for a sample of 2,685 firm-year observations in the period of 2006-2015.

Findings – Results show that firms operating in environmental risky industries tend to be leading CSP firms in Brazil which might be a positive consequence of the Brazilian environmental legislation that could be forcing such firms to be more committed to environmental issues. High ownership concentration reduces the probability of a firm’s membership to the ISE index signaling that large controlling blockholders may not see sustainability and governance concerns as relevant. Larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities tend to be CSP leaders. Additionally, the financial crisis of 2007-2009 had a negative effect on CSP in Brazil.

Practical implications – The implications of the present findings may be of interest to academics and firms’ stakeholders. The fact that firms from environmental risky industries exhibit higher concerns with CSP, probably because of the Brazilian environmental rules that has advanced in the past decades, show the prominence of policymakers in the critical scenario of environmental issues. When designing regulation, policymakers should be conscious of the importance of social issues and pay attention to all ways available to foster firm sustainability concerns. The additional evidence that dominant shareholders do not appear to see CSP as a relevant concern in Brazil points out an agency conflict in which large blockholders’ interests may be prevailing over other stakeholders’ interests. That is important to academics who study the role played by ownership structure on firm’s policies. Furthermore, larger firms, as well as the ones with more growth opportunities, seem to invest in CSP, possibly for seeing it as a way to generate competitive advantage.

Originality/value – As per the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper to point out the relevance of industry environmental sensitivity over firm’s commitment to sustainability issues in Brazil. Additional evidence is provided on the negative effect of ownership concentration on the probability of firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index using a longer period as well as robust logit panel data model estimates compared to previous studies. Unlike previous works, the paper analyzes the complexity of a sustainability index in the Brazilian market. Such index comprises corporate social responsibility, sustainability and corporate governance concerns. This set of concerns makes it a complex index and requires a deeper rationale for the determinants of CSP as proxied by the membership to it, under the stakeholder and agency theoretical frameworks.

and governance concerns cooperatively (Harrison et al., 2010). This range of stakeholders goes beyond the ones taken into account by the agency theory – shareholders, managers and creditors – and has caused a growing concern for firms about their operation, sustainability and relation with all stakeholders as predicted under the stakeholder theoretical framework. This means that the firm should not only worry about value creation for shareholders but also about the welfare of all social groups and the adequate interaction with the environment (Freeman and Phillips, 2002; Tullberg, 2013).

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions and the awareness to sustainability issues as a whole have been considered as able to improve firm’s reputation, with possible benefits on firm’s value, although the results are still inconclusive (Freeman et al., 2004; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Park et al., 2014). In this context, the assessment of corporate sustainability performance (CSP), taking into account environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) concerns, by specialized institutions has become usual, highlighting the importance given to social concerns and long-term sustainability of firms by market institutions (Chen and Nainggolan, 2018; Statman, 2006). The Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBOVESPA which comprises ESG issues of the Brazilian firm was launched in 2005 (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).

The motivating factors that drive corporate sustainability policy at the firm level have been highlighted as an important topic of research that requires additional attention (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007). Undertaking such research in emerging economies has also been highlighted as necessary (Ziegler and Schröder, 2010). In this regard, this work intends to advance research in the emerging markets framework by studying Brazil, an emerging economy with increasing international visibility, characterized by high private benefits of control, high ownership concentration and low protection of minority shareholders which favors the prevalence of controlling shareholders’ interests (Dyck and Zingales, 2004; La Porta et al., 1998). Besides, Brazil has faced some institutional advances in environmental protection in recent decades although there is still much to be done (Tollefson, 2016). Under the Brazilian environmental legislation, Law 10.165/2000 categorized industries’ environmental risk and enforced government environmental control. At this moment, it is important to assess whether these institutional advances observed in the Brazilian environmental legislation have been able to produce effects on the firm level.

This research aims to analyze firm’s attributes that are related to social and sustainability policies of Brazilian firms, focusing on firm’s environmental risk and ownership concentration. In this regard, more recently, ownership structure has been suggested to play a role on firm’s social and sustainability policies because of distinct shareholders’ interests and the diversity in institutional contexts (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007; Li and Zhang, 2010), as well as the environmental risk of firm’s activities (Adams, 2002; Crifo et al., 2015; Hackston and Milne, 1996). Additionally, the study also searches for the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and its eventual recovery in the aftermath.

To achieve this purpose, logistic regression models were estimated for a panel data set of 327 Brazilian listed firms, in a total of 2,685 firm-year observations, in the period of 2006-2015. The annual membership to the ISE of BM&FBOVESPA is used as proxy for higher CSP.

The results show that firm’s membership to an environmental risky industry, according the Brazilian environmental law, is able to improve firm’s CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries are leading CSP firms in Brazil given that they present higher probability to be a component of the ISE sustainability index. The findings also indicate that CSP proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index is adversely affected by high ownership concentration. This reveals the presence of an agency conflict in which dominant shareholders’ interests prevail over CSP, given that the presence of such shareholders lowers the probability that the firm becomes member of the annual Brazilian ISE. It is worth

mentioning that the negative effect of voting ownership concentration disappears with the presence of more large shareholders, taken into account by the voting ownership held by the four and five largest shareholders, signaling a possible contest power from other large shareholders who may favor CSR. Furthermore, other firm attributes also increase firm CSP, firm size and firm growth opportunities in Brazil.

The present work offers insights on the determinants of firm’s social and sustainability policies in an important emerging market (Brazil). The research builds on stakeholder and agency theories by investigating the possible effect of industry environmental risk and ownership concentration on CSP as proxied by firm’s membership to the Brazilian firm ISE. The study contributes to the literature that deals with firm membership to sustainability indices set by capital markets as a proxy for social and sustainability performance (Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Cris ostomo and Oliveira, 2016; Artiach et al., 2010). Specifically, the paper complements prior studies in the Brazilian market about CSP determinants by taking into account the industry environmental risk, using a larger variety of proxies for ownership concentration, extending the period of study and using panel data methodology that provides even more robust results and allows better analysis on the CSP determinants.

# 2. Background and hypotheses

# 2.1 The assessment of corporate sustainability

Literature suggests that firms actions related to sustainability are associated with ethical, environmental and economic criteria of a firm’s decision-making process to ensure business continuity, while corporate social policy may be more associated to the willingness of the firm to undertake actions that benefit stakeholders (Van Marrewijk and Werre, 2003). As a whole, corporate social and sustainability concerns integrate business ethics and stakeholder management, being all associated and complementary concepts under development (Sarkar and Searcy, 2016; Carroll and Shabana, 2010). Conceptual questions apart, assessing the degree of attention that a firm directs to social and sustainability concerns is a complex task and there is still no agreement on how it should be done. In fact, there are a variety of measures used in this context trying to adequately evaluate firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

The assessment of CSP as a whole may take into account firm sustainability, firm social concerns, business ethics, stakeholder management and environmental issues. Specialized institutions have worked on it and created indices that intend to convey information about the level of firms’ CSP (Statman, 2006). Examples of such indices are the ones created by market institutions like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index of the New York Stock Exchange; the FTSE-4Good in the London Stock Exchange; the Johannesburg Index in South Africa; and the Brazilian ISE set up by the Brazilian stock market.

# 2.2 The Brazilian corporate sustainability index

The ISE index is a theoretical portfolio, composed by up to 40 firms that are included into it based on an assessment process conducted by the ISE Advisory Committee. This committee is composed by 11 institutions, being headed by the Sa˜ o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) (Cunha and Samanez, 2013; BM&FBOVESPA, 2015). The information used in the assessment process is supplied by the company through a questionnaire. A firm that intends to participate in the ISE assessment process must fulfill the following requirements (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015):

- the firm must be among the 200 most traded in the stock market in the past year;
- the firm must have been traded in at least 50 per cent of the stock exchange sessions in the preceding year;

The firm must comply with the criteria endorsed by the ISE Advisory Committee Executive Council.

The ISE assessment process comprises seven areas or axes, related to both CSR and sustainability, distributed along the questionnaire:

- The axis “general information” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses how the firm behaves in relation to global agreements and whether the firm publishes social reports.
- The axis “nature of the product” (9.5 per cent of the questions) requires information about the risks and damages for human health associated with the firm’s products.
- The axis “corporate governance” (17 per cent of the questions) intends to evaluate shareholders relationships and the quality of the firm’s corporate governance system.
- The axis “financial-economics” (10 per cent of the questions) captures information about firm’s strategic planning, risk management and financial performance.
- The axis “social” (14 per cent of the questions) tries to assess firm’s relations with workers, suppliers and clients.
- The axis “climate change” (25 per cent of the questions) appraises whether the company is actually committed to policies for climate change prevention.
- The axis “environmental” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses firm’s concern with the natural environmental through the analysis of the number of problems with environmental licenses, or criminal prosecution because of environmental crimes.

Invited firms respond the ISE questionnaire in a voluntary manner. Firm assessment is based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis is based on the questionnaire score, in which all CSP axes have the same weight, with specific criteria and indicators in each axis. The qualitative analysis is based on the checking of supporting documents that are also requested from companies. Then, cluster analysis is run with the purpose of identifying groups of firms with similar CSP and make up firm ranking to compose the ISE portfolio that integrates up to the 40 best performing firms (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).

# 2.3 Determinants of corporate sustainability performance

The determinants of CSP are analyzed under distinct theoretical frameworks. Some firm’s attributes have been seen as able to affect CSP. Among such factors are, for example, firm size, profitability and leverage. More recently, agency conflicts, firm industry environmental risk as well as growth opportunities have also been considered.

There is evidence that ownership structure moderates agency conflicts among the main firm stakeholders. For instance, agency conflicts between shareholders and managers are moderated by ownership structure (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997).

Furthermore, there is evidence that ownership structure matters for firm value and performance as well as for firm strategic and financial policies (Allen and Phillips, 2000; Goergen and Renneboog, 2001; Schiantarelli and Sembenelli, 2000). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that ownership structure may also influence firm’s sustainability policy (Aguilera et al., 2007).

Research in different markets signals that ownership structure characteristics may matter for firm’s sustainability policy, under distinct arguments, although with inconclusive results (Faller and zu Knyphausen-Aufseß, 2016). For example, there is a positive effect of high firm ownership concentration in hands of the main shareholder on CSR in Spain (Godos Dı´ez et al., 2012). Equity ownership held by individual shareholder types has also received special attention. Institutional investors have a positive effect on CSR in USA.

(Harjoto and Jo, 2008). Government ownership favors CSR in Singapore and Malaysia (Eng and Mak, 2003; Said et al., 2009). In USA, internal ownership has a negative impact on CSR (Barnea and Rubin, 2010) and non-state ownership has an adverse effect on CSR in China (Li and Zhang, 2010). In Europe, ownership concentration held by the main shareholder is also detrimental to CSR (Lopez-Iturriaga and Lopez-de-Foronda, 2011). Ownership structure playing a role on firm’s policies is closely linked to the agency theory given that its influence may raise or minimize agency conflicts.

Firm controlling shareholders, who are common in high ownership concentrated firms, are interested in improving firm reputation which may be obtained from social and sustainability policies according to the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical approaches (Chiu and Sharfman, 2011). Thus, they may use social and sustainability policy to achieve this goal by prioritizing social and sustainability elements that may be more favorable to their purpose.

High concentrated ownership, frequently associated to a reduced number of controlling shareholders, may promote the exacerbation of private benefits of control (Riyanto and Toolsema, 2008) and may also be detrimental to the adoption of good corporate governance practices under the argument that controlling shareholders benefit from weaker corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Bozec and Bozec, 2007; Renders and Gaeremynck, 2012).

Sustainability indices, as is the case of ISE in Brazil, have corporate governance as a very relevant component as mentioned above (Section 2.2). In this context, high ownership concentration may also be negative to public firm accountability that tends to improve with a decrease in ownership concentration and more shareholders pressuring for better firm accountability in the opposite direction of high ownership concentration (Li and Zhang, 2010).

Although stakeholders theorists claim the value creation capacity of social and sustainability performance, such capacity for value creation is still uncertain (Husted and Allen, 2007). This doubtful value creation capacity of firm’s social and sustainability activities may discourage controlling shareholders to undertake social and sustainability policies. Besides, corporate governance which is not a priority for dominant blockholders is really important in the ISE sustainability index. Thus, it seems plausible to propose the hypothesis that dominant shareholders of the Brazilian firm are looking for private benefits of control and do not prioritize the improvement of firm sustainability in its entirety. This rationale leads to the proposal that voting ownership concentration is negative to CSP as proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index in the following terms:

# H1.

Ownership concentration has an adverse effect on the probability of the firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index which signals firm CSP.

Firm’s commitment to social and sustainability issues have been proposed to be favorable to firm’s image and reputation under the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical frameworks (Bebbington et al., 2008; Michelon, 2011). Nowadays, environmental concerns are relevant for firm’s external valuation, and this reality has motivated more complete firm sustainability disclosure (Crifo et al., 2015; Bouten et al., 2011). In fact, empirical research has proposed and found evidence on the influence that environmental activities have on corporate reputation (D’Souza et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2012).

Firms from environmental risky industries have more complex relation with the natural environment and external stakeholders tend to be more focused on such firms’ concerns on environmental issues (Hackston and Milne, 1996; Adams, 2002; Patten, 2002; Campbell, 2003). Because of this higher vulnerability to environmental concerns and pressure from stakeholders, firms with activities that are more aggressive to the natural environment will try to signal stakeholders that they follow adequate sustainable practices through adequate sustainability disclosure (Campbell, 2003; Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009; Dyduch and Krasodomska, 2017).

In Brazil, it is important to evaluate the role played by firm industry environmental risk on CSP, given the raising relevance devoted to this issue since the enactment of important legal instruments. It is important to mention the Brazilian Environmental Policy Law 6,938/1981 (revised by Law 10,165/2000), and the Brazilian Constitution/1988 are influential legal

instruments that highlighted the importance of firm environmental concerns. Both these influential legal instruments highlighted the importance of firms’ environmental concerns. The enactment of Law 10.165/2000 was a threshold for firms’ environmental concerns in Brazil by stratifying firm industry under environmental risk layers (low, medium and high), establishing the Control and Environmental Inspection Fee for all firms from stratified sectors, and also by compelling stratified firms to report annual activities to the government.

Firm’s relation with the government and with the natural environment is crucial under the stakeholder theoretical framework. Thus, together with increasing social pressures, Brazilian institutional setting has faced advances in environmental legislation to impose stricter rules on firms in relation with the natural environment. The advances in legal rules, associated with local and international social pressures, tend to force firms to be more committed to environmental, social and sustainability issues which may also be reflected in the search for higher CSP and positive visibility through the presence in sustainability indices as proposed in the following hypothesis:

# H2.

Firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

The stakeholder theory proposes the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm performance under the rationale that social responsibility actions are able to create value for the firm because society has a positive sensitivity to this type of corporate action (Freeman et al., 2004; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Stakeholder theorists indeed contend that under the perspective that the firm must be concerned with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, the company must look for maximizing not only shareholders’ interests but also all other stakeholders’ interests, which may be achieved through the commitment to ESG issues that are related to a wider range of stakeholders. They advocate that such commitment is able to foster the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm’s performance.

In fact, prior research on the relationship between CSP and firm profitability has seen it as dynamic with results revealing profitability as a determinant of CSP and also the opposite (Garcia-Castro et al., 2010; McGuirre et al., 1988). Thus, firm’s perspective is expanded by integrating an ethical and responsible conduct (Harrison et al., 2010). Such ethical conduct has been seen as able to improve firm’s image and create value in the mid- and long-run by promoting a virtuous cycle between firm and its stakeholders, favoring firm’s market share and competitive advantage (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

The argument about the effect of profitability on sustainability is associated with the fact that firms with higher profitability, under the financial slack resources theoretical framework, tend to have more funds available to undertake social and environmental actions (Husted and Salazar, 2006; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Following this argument, it seems appropriate to hypothesize that profitability contributes to higher CSP:

# H3.

Profitability has a positive effect on CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

Firm size has often been suggested as able to moderate firm social and sustainability policies and, indeed, it has been used as an important control variable in this context, although the arguments about the possible effect of firm size on these policies are still controversial (Baumann-Pauly et al., 2013; Orlitzky, 2001; Udayasankar, 2008). It is postulated that larger firms are able to provide more resources to support firm’s social and sustainability policy. Additionally, as the firm becomes larger, it interacts with a wider scope of stakeholders and, this way, experiences greater appeal for ESG concerns. In this vein, such concerns tend to be more relevant to larger firms which are more compelled to follow ethical behavior and integrate better corporate governance practices (Ullman, 1985; Ziegler and Schro¨ der, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013). Following this rationale, we propose that larger firms are more prone to be committed with sustainability issues as summarized in the following hypothesis:

# Larger firms are more likely to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

There are arguments suggesting that innovation process, which is closely related to growth opportunities, is positive to the firm production system by making it more effective, given that innovation leads to optimizing the consumption of energy and natural resources, and thus reducing its effect on the natural environment. This may lead to better corporate sustainability related to products and processes (Padgett and Galan, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Artiach et al., 2010). Besides, firm’s growth opportunities have been considered to be related to firm’s commitment to sustainability given that the firm needs to signal to the market that it is sustainable to be able to access external funds to seize its growth opportunities. Thus, to better maximize its growth opportunities, which is closely related to innovation process that is beneficial to firm’s sustainability, the firm needs to show that it is committed to sustainability in terms of natural environment concerns, stakeholder management and business ethics, which involves good standards of corporate governance, adequate relations with clients and supply chain and natural environment concerns. This rationale motivates the following hypothesis:

# H5. Growth opportunities have a positive influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

Creditors are usually effective in pressing for the meeting of their demands, as they finance firm’s investment and need guarantees for the return of their funds. This situation sometimes leads to firm monitoring if the firm increases its indebtedness (Artiach et al., 2010). Thus, in low leveraged firms, creditors exert less pressure over their rights. On the other hand, more indebted firms are more committed to creditor rights. The financial obligations with creditors may lead to reduced slack resources and to lower firm’s capacity to undertake social and sustainability actions which require available funds, constraining the firm to direct funds to CSR activities (Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). These arguments lead to the hypothesis proposal that debt may inhibit firm sustainability policy as follows:

# H6. Debt has a negative influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

# 3. Empirical research

# 3.1 Sample

The sample is composed of 2,685 firm-year observations from 327 firms, covering the period of 2006-2015. The year 2006 corresponds to the first year of the Brazilian Firm ISE. Firms financial and ownership data were obtained from Economatica database. Every firm’s sector was checked in Law 10.165/2000 to categorize each one according to the industry environmental risk. The status of composing the annual ISE, that is the proxy for higher CSP, was collected at the ISE website at BM&FBOVESPA. The sample period is also relevant given that it allows assessing the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and eventual recovery in the aftermath. The whole sample of firms is distributed among several sectors of the economy (Table I). As can be observed in Table I, membership to the ISE seems to attract firms from all industries. It is worth mentioning that three sectors – “Chemicals, paper products, metal-mechanical”, “Financial” and “Electrical, Water supply and sanitary services” – exhibit higher proportions of firms in the ISE than out of it. This can be motivated by characteristics of firms’ interests on positive visibility and also because of industry regulation. For example, in Brazil, the National Agency of Electrical Energy establishes specific sustainability guidelines for the energy sector (Braga et al., 2014).

# 3.2 Models and method

The difficulties in finding adequate measures for firms social and sustainability concerns are probably because of the diversity of actions a firm may undertake in such framework, the

absence of uniform disclosure format and also its non-mandatory nature (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Aguinis and Glavas, 2012). Sustainability concerns are associated with firm’s environmental concerns and also with firm’s capacity to maintain performance and competitive advantage which may be dependent on good management and corporate governance practices, which signals the relevance given to the economic pillar of sustainability (Moldan et al., 2012). All this means that CSP indices are subject to complex measuring strategies as can be seen in the multiplicity of indices used (Li and Tang, 2007; Hodgson et al., 2011).

This work uses the membership to the Brazilian Firm ISE as proxy for the level of firm CSP given that it integrates CSR and sustainability concerns. The annual membership to the ISE is the dependent variable (CSP) in the logit panel data model of equation (1):

CSPi;t = b0 + b1 OWNCi;t + b2 RSKINDi;t + b3 ROAi;t + b4 SIZE + b5 GOPPi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (1)

In model of equation (1), the dummy variable CSP, is set to 1 if firm i is present in the ISE at year t, meaning high CSP, and 0 otherwise. OWNC is a measure of ownership concentration in hands of the first up to the fifth main stockholder. It corresponds to the voting capital held by the main stockholder (OWNC1), the sum of voting capital in hands of the two main stockholders (OWNC2) and so forth up to the sum of voting stocks held by the five main stockholders (OWNC5). Additionally, for sensitivity analysis, we also estimate alternate logit panel data models. First, we use the annual Herfindahl index of voting ownership concentration in hands of the five main voting shareholders for each firm-year observation (HI5). The Herfindahl index corresponds to the sum of squares of voting stocks held by each of the five main shareholders following previous literature (Maury and Pajuste, 2005). Second, we use a dummy variable for the presence of a dominant controlling shareholder, i.e. a stockholder that holds more than 50 per cent of voting capital (MAJOR).

Environmental risky industry (RSKIND) was taken into account based on the Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment (Law 10.165/2000). Such law created a fee for environmental control and inspection that are to be paid by firms from environmental risky industries. Law 10.165/2000 lists which are those environmental risky industries in terms of the potential to damage the natural environment. Thus, RSKIND is a dummy variable that is set to 1 if the firm sector is in the list of environmental risky industries, and is set to 0 otherwise.

Growth opportunities (GOPP) is proxied by Tobin’s q which is calculated as the ratio between firm’s market value plus debt, and firm’s accounting value, as usual in the literature (Villalonga and Amit, 2006). Return on assets (ROA) proxies for firm’s profitability. Finally,

also as common in the literature, natural logarithm of firm’s total assets is used as proxy for firm’s size (SIZE). In equations (1) and (2), i refers to firm; t is related to period; dt is the error term related to time-specific effects; ai is the error term associated with firm-specific effects (which includes unobservable firm-specific characteristics); and mi,t is the random error term.

Alternate models [equation (2)] include the variable firm debt (DEBT), being measured by the ratio of total debt over total assets. These logit panel data models (for all measures of ownership concentration) are estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms, for which debt emerges as an important control variable commonly mentioned in the literature.

CSPi;t = b0 + b1OWNCi;t + b2RSKINDi;t + b3ROAi;t + b4SIZE + b5GOPPi;t + b5DEBTi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (2)

Models are estimated using panel data logistic regression model (“xtlogit” command in STATA). Panel data methodology allows the treatment of unobservable heterogeneity associated with fixed firm effects which are those specific firm attributes that do not change over time. With the purpose of having robust results, we kept in the panel data only firms with at least four years of available data. Description of models variables are summarized in Table II trying to make it clearer.

Notes: CV = Coefficient of variation. HI5 is the Herfindahl index for voting ownership concentration held by the five main shareholders. OWNC (1-5) refers to the sum of voting shares (%) held by the main first up to the five main shareholders. ROA is return on assets. GOPP stands for growth opportunities, proxied by Tobin’s q. DEBT refers to firm leverage (ratio of total debt to total assets). SIZE proxies for firm size (Ln of total assets).

Three main shareholders have 75.9 per cent of voting shares. The fairly low coefficient of variation (CV) also signals that there is little variation in the high levels of concentration. These numbers show that indeed ownership of Brazilian firm is highly concentrated as previously documented (Carvalhal, 2012). The reality of high concentrated ownership may lead to specific effects on certain firm strategic policies as abovementioned, including CSP as hypothesized in this work.

Table III also contains tests for the difference in means for model variables between leading CSP firms (ISE firms) and the other firms (non ISE firms). As can be observed, leading CSP firms (firms at the ISE index) present lower level of voting ownership concentration (OWNC), have more growth opportunities (GOPP), present higher profitability (ROA) and are larger (SIZE). Additionally, the proportion of firms from environmental risky industries in the group of leading CSP firms is 73.15 per cent which is significantly higher than 26.85 per cent from other sectors as detected by the test of difference in proportions (p-value = 0.000) (Table IV).

Notes: environmental risk industries. Pearson x2 (1) = 27,256; p-value = 0.000. Test for the difference in proportions of firms that are members and from high environmental risk industries.

cent of firm-year observations (1,606) are from environmental risky industries which means that Brazilian legislation has expanded more effective environmental control to a broad spectrum of industries. Among the firms that are members of the ISE sustainability index, the highest proportion is relative to environmental risky industries (73.15 per cent), while only 26.85 per cent are from other industries. That is a strong indication in the direction of H2 which predicts that firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have greater CSP.

Results for model estimates of equation (1) for the whole sample are exhibited in Table V. Alternate models that include debt as explanatory variable were estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms (Table VI).

As hypothesized, voting ownership concentration of the Brazilian firm negatively affects its CSP, proxied by the probability of the firm being in the ISE index (Table V) (H1). This result is consistent to models estimated with different measures of ownership concentration, i.e. the presence of a major controlling shareholder (MAJOR) (Table V, column i), the sum of voting stocks in hands of the first up to the three main shareholders (OWNC1 to OWNC3) (Table V, columns iii, iv and v) and also by the Herfindahl index among the five main stockholders (HI5) (column ii). Taking into account that CSP includes ESG concerns such result is consistent with the argument that large controlling shareholders of the Brazilian firm may not see sustainability concerns as so relevant. Together, corporate governance and the economic pillar of sustainability are very important in the ISE index (approximately 30 per cent of the questionnaire). The high importance of corporate governance concerns embedded in the ISE sustainability index may be relevant for this inverse relation given that prior literature has pointed out ownership concentration is associated to weaker corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Hu and Izumida, 2008; Branda˜ o and Cris ostomo, 2015). Under the agency theoretical framework, this situation may contribute to a rise in agency conflicts among controlling, minority and external stakeholders. It is also noticed that the negative effect of ownership concentration over CSP is absent when considering.

Notes: Estimates obtained from panel data logistic model. Dependent variable is the dummy variable CSP that is assigned 1 if the firm i is listed at the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA (ISE) in the year t and 0 otherwise. HI5 is the Herfindahl index for voting ownership concentration held by the five main shareholders. OWNC (1-5) refers to the sum of voting shares (%) held by the main one up to the five main shareholders. ROA is return on assets. GOPP stands for growth opportunities, proxied by Tobin’s q. SIZE (Ln of total assets) proxies for firm size. DEBT is leverage measured as total debt divided by total assets; and refer to 1, 5 and 10% significance levels, respectively ownership concentration is in hands of the four and five main shareholders (OWNC4 to OWNC5) (Table IV, columns vi and vii). That means that higher voting concentrated ownership among the four and five main large shareholders may signal that the presence of more than three large blockholders is able to reduce the detrimental effect of up to three controlling shareholders on sustainability performance. This finding is in the direction of the contest power of blockholders over the excess power of one or two large controlling shareholders (Jara-Bertin et al., 2008). Besides the contest power, this could also be because of advances in blockholders’ sensitivity to CSR issues in more recent periods because of local and global institutional pressures.

As proposed under the rationale of H2, an important firm attribute – the firm pertinence to an environmental risky industry (RSKIND) – may be an important determinant for the degree of firm CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries seem to be more committed to social and sustainability issues signaling that such firms believe that higher CSP is an important instrument to improve firm reputation and legitimacy of its activities. The activities undertaken by such firms to manage environmental concerns may probably increase their punctuation in ISE’s inquire at the same time that these firms are probably struggling to be a member of the annual ISE list as a way to show that they are actually concerned with sustainability issues. In fact, a detailed analysis of membership to the ISE sustainability index shows that firms seem to make an effort to be at the ISE index as depicted by the presence of firms in consecutive years. Among these persistent firms, many of them are from environmental risky industries, as is the case of AES ELETROPAULO, CEMIG, CPFL ENERGIA and BRASKEM which were present in ten periods at ISE, or GERDAU and SUZANO PAPEL which were at the ISE index in nine periods (Cris ostomo et al., 2018).

Contrary to our expectation, profitability is not a determinant for the degree of CSP (H3). In fact, the set of results in the literature are not conclusive about this effect. Perhaps, the

Financial slack resources proposal may not hold for the Brazilian firm given that it faces financial constraints for investment (Crisostomo et al., 2014; Bassetto and Kalatzis, 2011) which may signal the absence of slack resources that could be used to fund social and sustainability activities. Other firm attributes have shown to be able to affect CSP. In fact, firm size has a positive effect over CSP as argued under H4, supporting the suggestion that larger firms are more capable of addressing social and sustainability concerns given that they tend to have more resources available for that (Udayasankar, 2008). Firm growth opportunities also have a positive effect over CSP as proposed under the rationale of H5 that the need to seize growth opportunities will require more firm commitment to social and sustainability concerns, as well as with good corporate governance practices, given that this may be relevant in the search for funds to finance firms’ investment projects.

The alternate models estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms with the debt variable (DEBT) included as an explanatory variable are shown in Table VI. As can be derived from models coefficients, the aforementioned results were confirmed. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries (RSKIND) present higher probability of being a leading CSP firm. High ownership concentration indeed has a negative effect on firm’s CSP and the absence of such adverse effect for the concentration in hands of the main four and five shareholders (OWNC4 and OWNC5) signal that more large shareholders are able to minimize such negative effect on firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Table VI, columns vi and vii). The same result holds for larger firms and firms with more growth opportunities.

As hypothesized, growth opportunities have a positive effect on Brazilian firm CSP proxied by the firm pertinence to the ISE index. Indeed, a firm with more growth opportunities needs all available funds to maximize them. For so, the firm must signal that it ratifies good corporate governance practices and has sustainability as a relevant concern. This is crucial in the financial market. This finding of the positive influence of growth opportunities on CSP is in accordance with previous results (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Ziegler and Schro¨der, 2010).

The positive effect of firm size on CSP of Brazilian firm follows the theoretical proposal that larger firms are more able to undertake social responsibility actions (CSR) and, in parallel, are required to show more high standards of sustainability concerns. This finding is also consistent with previous studies in different markets, including Brazil (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Nunes et al., 2010).

Contrary to the expected negative effect, there is no effect of debt over CSP according to the results. In fact, debt costs and possible undesirable external control from creditors does not seem to adversely affect CSP. That could be because of the fact that more concern on firm sustainability is suggested to be positive to external financing given that the funding market may take such concern into account when analyzing firm funding requests (Magnanelli and Izzo, 2017; Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). This conflicting situation between favorable and unfavorable effect of debt over CSP may lead to the absence of association between debt and an index that incorporates CSR and sustainability.

Additional models were estimated to assess whether the financial crisis (2007-2009) which affected many countries, was able to deter CSP of Brazilian firms given its potential to decrease firms’ financial performance with possible negative effect on CSP. Table VII summarizes results of model estimates that integrate period dummy variables that refer to the periods before, during and after crisis. The findings signal that indeed the crisis period had an adverse effect on CSP (Table VII; Panel A). Mainly, important is that in the period after crisis there has been observed a strong trend for improvement in Brazilian firms’ CSP (Table VII; Panel B).

Overall, the findings show that indeed firm membership to an environmental risky industry is an important firm attribute for higher public accountability and better CSP. In fact, Brazilian

Additional evidence is provided about the adverse effect of high ownership concentration of Brazilian firms on CSP, revealing that large controlling shareholders are not so concerned with ESG issues. Perhaps, the great proportion of corporate governance and economic dimensions of the ISE index may be driving this result taking into account that previous literature has found important negative effect of ownership concentration over corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Branda˜ o and Cris ostomo, 2015). Worth noting is the new evidence provided that more large blockholders seem to be able to reduce this negative influence of high ownership concentration over CSP which may signal the existence of an initial contest power in this specific firm policy. It is important to note the relevance of firm size and growth opportunities in improving CSP, and that the

macroeconomic conditions during the international financial crisis (2007-2009) had adverse effect on Brazilian firms’ CSP. Table VIII summarizes all results found trying to leave it clearer.

# 5. Conclusions

The increasing relevance of CSP, which comprises ESG concerns, on business practices, has motivated research about its drivers. In this context, this work analyzes CSP determinants in an important emerging market, Brazil. CSP is proxied by the firm’s annual membership to the Brazilian ISE. Firm’s presence in the ISE index is conditioned on a tough competition among firms that fulfill a specific questionnaire comprising seven dimensions of corporate, social and sustainability concerns. A new large panel data set of Brazilian firms for the period of 2006-2015 was built, containing 2,685 firm-year observations with at least four years of observations for each firm.

Literature has suggested a set of firm attributes as able to affect firm CSP, as for example, firm size, firm performance, industry environmental sensitivity and ownership structure. This work provides evidence that firms from environmental risky industries are found to be leading CSP firms given that they have higher probability to be present in the Brazilian ISE. This reality shows that indeed firm’s industry environmental sensitivity is relevant to CSP. This may be a consequence of stakeholders’ pressure and institutional advances achieved in Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment which may be leading to positive enforcement results. It is important to highlight the negative effect of macroeconomic conditions during the financial crisis (2007-2009) on Brazilian firm CSP and that in the aftermath when such adverse situation seems to have faced a reversion.

Under the agency theoretical framework, high firm ownership concentration is proposed as able to align the principal and agent interests, at the same time that may favor the interests of controlling shareholders who become powerful enough to influence important firm policies, including social and sustainability responsibilities. The excess power of large

Blockholders has grounded the stakeholder framework used in this research that has documented an adverse effect of ownership concentration on Brazilian firm CSP. This result signals that controlling shareholders may not see the whole set of social and sustainability issues as a priority. It is important to highlight the new finding that more large stockholders appear to be able to contest the excess power of controlling blockholders and reduce the negative impact of high ownership concentration over CSP, signaling an emerging contest power in this context. Besides, larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities seem to be more committed to undertaking social and sustainability actions.

The contribution of the work is twofold and may be of interest to distinct constituencies. The research analyzes the composition of the ISE index (Brazilian ISE) which indeed integrates ESG concerns. For researchers, the index analysis is important given its relevance nowadays when social concerns in general have gained importance in financial markets. Starting from the ISE index analysis, the work provides additional evidence on the firm’s attributes that influence CSP, as proxied by membership to the ISE index. Similar research may be undertaken in other markets using similar methodology, given that indices such as ISE do not publicize firm punctuation.

New relevant evidence is provided about the fact that firms from environmental risky industries are linked to higher probability of composing the sustainability index and thus to higher standards of social and sustainability activities. This finding builds on stakeholder theory by highlighting positive results from the Brazilian environmental legislation, being an important discovery to both environmentalists and academics. The analysis of how voting ownership concentration affects firm’s CSP builds on both agency and stakeholder theories by exposing agency conflicts and stakeholders’ interests. This examination provides evidence that CSP is negatively affected by high ownership concentration in Brazil, in accordance with prior results but also pointing out the new finding that the presence of other large shareholders, who are associated to more ownership dispersion, seem to be able to contest the power of large controlling blockholders.

The paper concludes highlighting the importance of enforcing corporate social and sustainability institutionalization in Brazil. The positive effects obtained from the advances in environmental legislation must be taken into account to foster strengthening in other dimensions of CSP such as the relations with employees and civil society. Policymakers ought to observe society demands and the need to preserve the natural environment. In this regard, the encouragement of civil society to pressure government and firms for better CSP is very relevant.

The present findings are relevant to the ongoing debate on the importance of CSP and firms’ attributes that influence on it. Thus, this work meets the request from international audience for this kind of research in emerging economies which present distinct institutional environments and incipient capital markets. The results refer to the 9a economy in the world that is a BRIC member.

Some research lines are identified. Analyzing the seven ISE axes separately may be considered a limitation of this work while it is a challenge for future research. Studying the effect of other aspects of Brazilian firms’ ownership structure also emerges as another insightful research as is the case of controlling blockholders’ nature. Specific works may also try to capture the capacity of civil society organizations to pressure for CSP advances.

# Corporate sustainability disclosure’s importance in China: financial analysts’ perception

# Jhunru Zhang, Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta and Terri Trireksani

# Abstract

Purpose – Corporate sustainability in China has become a subject of increasing international concern. Corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) is considered a useful tool to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of stakeholders in the quest for sustainability. However, the degree of cultural and political influences for being sustainably orientated can be significantly different between countries. This study aims to examine the perception of financial analysts, as CSD report users, in China about the level of importance of various indicators of corporate sustainability described in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Design/methodology/approach – A set of questionnaires was developed based on GRI G4 guidelines to measure the perception of financial analysts in China on the level of importance of each sustainability indicator described in the GRI G4. A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the report users’ perceptions of each of the indicators.

Findings – The findings of this study increase our understanding of how Chinese CSD report users perceive corporate sustainability differently from the GRI guidelines. The main results show that the environmental aspect of sustainability was seen to be important in China, followed by the social and economic aspects. Indicator-wise, “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” were perceived as vital in the environmental category, while “customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” were considered significant in the social category.

Originality/value – This study addresses the need for differing corporate sustainability guidelines for different nations and cultures, specifically within the Chinese context. It also contributes to the corporate sustainability literature by adding to our understanding of how financial analysts in China, as CSD report users, perceive aspects of sustainability.

# 1. Introduction

While the economic development of China over the preceding decades has led to significant improvement in its national prosperity, it has also generated a considerable degree of concern about corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability disclosures (CSD) are generally considered to be the most effective and efficient way for companies to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of company stakeholders’ quest for sustainability and to inform the society about their sustainability performance (Qian et al., 2015). Because of the lack of comprehensive and effectively enforced CSD regulations, the growth of corporate sustainability practices in China extensively depends on voluntary disclosure practice (Zhang et al., 2015). However, as

Recognised the importance of issuing corporate sustainability reports because of the severe environmental deterioration and significant social issues raised in tandem with the boost of the Chinese economy.

For example, the serious milk powder corporate scandals in mainland China have raised extreme concern regarding companies’ social responsibility: in 2008, Sanlu Group added melamine into the formula of milk powder to boost the protein content. Infants who consumed this product were highly likely to develop kidney stones or even an illness that was fatal if seriously affected. Sanlu Group was one of the largest milk powder manufacturers and sellers in China for over 15 continuous years, and it was once the biggest taxpayer. The revelation of the scandal caused the failure and bankruptcy of Sanlu, and, more importantly, it destroyed people’s confidence in the Chinese milk powder supply industry. The 300,000 victims triggered considerable social pressure, which consequently affected thousands of workers, causing them to lose their jobs (Nornha et al., 2013). Society, as a result, had to bear this significant social cost.

As such, the unique context in China provides a significant setting to examine CSD perception from its users’ end. The local Chinese community, in general, has relatively high societal acceptance towards CSD information. Under the Confucius perspective, maximising shareholders’ value and financial profit should not be the only goal of making corporations sustainable (Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009). Xia et al. (2009) emphasised the idea of righteousness before profits and stated that the fundamental value of ethics should reflect the business values. Hence, concerns and actions should always be closely related to all of the customers’, employees’ and shareholders’ values, and sustainability information is in favour for the general community as Confucian culture has been embedded in the basis of modern corporate sustainability in Chinese companies (Zhu and Yao, 2008).

In addition, Chinese enterprises are increasingly pressured by numerous stakeholders and by the general public to engage in social and environmental sustainability. In particular, in China, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) have made a great effort to promote corporate governance initiatives in past years. Ho (2013) indicates that the rapid growth of these markets is significantly influenced by two essential pieces of legislation: the Company Law and the Securities Law, enacted in 1993 and 1998, respectively. The Company Law provides the legal requirement for the transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private or listed enterprises. To conform to the two legislations, the stock exchanges in China have implemented guidelines for their listed corporations to take responsibility for their stakeholders. The SZSE issued the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Guidelines for Listed Companies in 2006 and the SSE issued similar guidelines in 2008, and both stock exchanges begin to mandate CSR reporting in a subset of listed companies. However, the guidelines provide limited assistance to companies preparing for their disclosures. The lack of a prescribed reporting framework is, therefore, ambiguous and has led to large variations in reporting practice, such that users find the reports challenging to compare and use for decision-making (Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, sustainability information can be used for window-addressing and causes heterogeneous expectation among investors. The subsequent noise increases stock price volatility and decreases firm values (Orlitzky, 2013). Given the local community in China is in favour for CSD information, particularly under the sustainability promotional strategy by the state government, CSD reporting companies are likely to be inadequately guided by the existent guidelines and generating information that increases the dispersion of the market expectation. However, limited research has examined what is expected from primary stakeholders and how the reporting companies should address such expectations. As such, in this study, we focus on financial analysts’ perceived importance of CSD in the unique institutional setting of China.

# 2. Literature review and hypotheses development

# 2.1 The context of sustainability reporting in China

Sustainability reporting, which is also referred to as CSR reporting, focused solely on social issues at its very beginning stage in the early 1960s (Lin, 2010). Elkington (1994) suggested that there are six stages of CSD development, which include ignorance, awakening, denial, guilt reduction, displacement behaviour and tokenism, conversion and finally, integration. This was further extended and re-summarised by Dunphy et al. (2003). They developed more sophisticated concepts for each of the six stages of CSD development, which include rejection, non-responsiveness, compliance, efficiency, strategic proactivity and the sustaining corporation.

After the emergence of triple bottom line reporting, the number of companies that issued CSD increased, with different names to show different areas of focus. Reynolds and Yuthas (2008) explained this early stage of reporting sustainability as companies owing the duty to the society in which they are bonded with a social contract.

According to Freeman (1984), sustainability reporting is an approach for a company to identify its socially relevant behaviour, determine those to whom the company is accountable for its environmental and social performance and develop appropriate measures and reporting techniques. However, being sustainable or ecologically responsible is defined differently across cultures (Hofstede, 1980).

In China, CSD is mostly perceived to be a response to external government and public pressures on corporate management (Gao, 2009). The notion of corporate sustainability reporting was first proposed in 2006 in the amendment of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China, Article 5 of the General Law. Later in 2006, in the Chinese Communist Party Sixth Plenary Session, a national plan proposal was made to create a harmonious Chinese society with a focus on being socially responsible, particularly for business enterprises (Gao, 2010).

As a response to the national plan, the SSE and SZSE issued social reporting guidelines in 2006 and 2008, respectively, to create an appropriate system for corporate sustainability reporting. According to the SSE guidelines Notice for Better Reporting 2008 Annual Reports, a subset of industries that were listed in the Chinese financial market, including the SSE corporate governance sector, firms with shares listed overseas and financial companies, were mandated to prepare CSR reports alongside the annual reports. However, despite the introductions of a number of policies after the two stock exchange markets announced their guidelines, the meaning and definition of corporate sustainability were never specified. The guidelines also did not provide any indication of how to prepare and what to include in a CSD. While the CSR guidelines in China have initiated systematics rule and approaches to report CSR, the coverage and the specificity of the reports are still less comprehensive than those formulated in the Western context (Nornha et al., 2013).

The board indications from the CSR guidelines in China are provided below:

- Listed companies are encouraged to disclose non-financial information in CSR reports.
- Non-financial information should be based on the triple bottom line namely, economic, social and environmental information.
- CSR reports should be endorsed by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.
- Areas and circumstances in which listed companies should compulsorily disclose environmental information are indicated.
- A new concept of social contribution value per share (SCVPS), a ratio used to measure the listed companies.

(Nornha et al., 2013, p. 32)

As suggested further by Nornha et al. (2013), the reporting companies could choose their own methods to calculate the related ratio under the guidelines, which was subjective and challenging for companies to follow. While the concept of corporate sustainability has become more commonly accepted in China, there has been no agreed-upon definition of it. Therefore, the standardisation and the regulations of corporate sustainability in China are in a great need of development (Bai et al., 2015).

# 2.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines in China

In China, the GRI (2013) guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reportings. In recent decades, GRI has attempted to provide comprehensive guidelines for CSD by setting indicators in corporate economic, environmental and social sustainability (Chauvey et al., 2015). Firms that adopt GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines need to report their strategy in the company profiles, explain their management approach as to how they address corporate sustainability practices and disclose their company sustainability (economic, environmental and social) performance (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). GRI, overall, provides companies with information on how and what to report in CSD.

While GRI provides such comprehensive sets of guidelines on CSR, it ultimately aims to enhance companies’ information transparency and overall accountability. This has elevated the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to become the most commonly used framework internationally (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). The KPMG Questionnaire into CSR (KPMG, 2008) examined the top 250 companies listed on the Fortune Global 500 and the 100 largest firms by revenue in 22 countries. The results showed that more than 75 per cent of companies from the Fortune Global 500 and 70 per cent of the 100 largest revenue firms applied the GRI. GRI is also considered practical for firms to use as report preparers are able to self-examine their own level of corporate sustainability performance.

As suggested by Brown et al. (2009), GRI is significant in terms of its “broad range of stakeholders” approach, as well as institutionalising multi-stakeholders on reporting and accountability. However, Drori et al. (2006) indicated that GRI is mostly presented by multinational companies on a global basis and international accounting firms have large influence on standardising the guidelines. Western multinational firms, therefore, help to set the agenda on corporate sustainability reporting based on their own interests (Vigneau et al., 2015). It is suggested that “the guidelines’ lack of universal applicability creates a perceived unfairness inherent in imposing Western standards of social behaviour and associated reporting practices” (Adams and McNicholas, 2007, p. 484).

Nevertheless, GRI remains highly authoritative globally because of its context, language, concepts and assumptions (Brown et al., 2009). It has a significant role to highlight the importance of corporate sustainability reporting and has led to new practices of corporate sustainability and responsibility (Vigneau et al., 2015). Hopkins (2004) also contends that the GRI guidelines include some aspects of the other popular environmental and social guidelines, such as the ISO 14000 and the global Sullivan principles.

# 2.3 Perceptions and motivations of sustainability in China

Early studies on the topic of perception of CSR in the Chinese context have broadly discussed the differential impact to measure CSR based on the Western and the Chinese definitions. Both Western and Chinese literature indicates that corporate sustainability is, to some degree, directly related to shareholders and companies values, as well as the need for the companies to be legitimate and ethical. Cultural differences have also created some different perceptions about corporate sustainability in the West and the East. Many studies, which were conducted in China, into Chinese culture and corporate sustainability, have explored the idea of profits from righteousness (Yi) principle, derived from Confucius.

Another stream of studies on CSR perception in China is generally focused on the potential of political interference and government intervention, and it examines the disclosure content to reveal the propensity for firms to report on government policies (Gao, 2011; Kuo et al., 2012; Li and Zhang, 2010; Marquis and Qian, 2014). Kuo et al. (2012), based on a content analysis of Chinese data obtained from CSR reports, found that environmental sensitivity and ownership structures distinguish corporate environmental disclosures. Sensitive industries and government-owned firms are found to be more committed to providing environmental disclosures than less-sensitive industries and non-government-owned firms. They were also highly engaged in energy saving, carbon reduction, research and application of new techniques – beneficial activities that assist China in dealing with the global warming issue. Kuo et al.’s (2012) study also suggested that the Chinese government has an important role in promoting corporate CSR engagement.

Marquis and Qian (2014) examined corporate strategic response to government signals through CSR disclosure. They examined 1,600 listed firms between 2006 and 2009, and their results supported the findings of Kuo et al. (2012) that the Chinese government’s signalling is a critical driver for corporate reporting, particularly for the SOEs that exert substantial political influence. Further, they found that the reporting companies are highly subjective to decoupling risk under specific monitoring mechanism. The expectation of policymakers drove the reported CSR practices.

Gao (2011) found that the listed companies in the Chinese financial market had, overall, a positive attitude to engage in CSR. Specifically, they found that SOEs have a higher tendency to engage in social issues through CSR than the non-SOEs. Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.

Through a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”. They discussed the multiplexity of the business system and its impact on the CSR concepts in the Chinese context. In particular, they examined the “authorisation capitalism” within the family owned small and medium firms, which suggested that the CSR engagement in these types of firms was oriented to local concern and driven by the local community’s perception of the CSR.

# 2.3.1 Users’ perceived importance of corporate sustainability disclosure in China

While existing literature in Chinese CSR has focused more on SOEs, there are also some limited studies that explore CSR practices at non-SOEs. Kuo et al. (2015), for example, suggested that there were no significant differences between environmental disclosure at SOEs and those at the privately owned enterprises. Based on an evaluation of 781 CSR reports between 2008 and 2010, they found the higher disclosure quality in CO2 and SO2 emission was predominantly because of the government-led national strategy; however, other social activities were better reported by privately owned firms.

From the theoretical point of view, signalling theory has been getting attention in corporate disclosure studies in recent years, because it assumes that people send and explain signals to reduce information asymmetry (Lin, 2010). The theory considers that information asymmetry typically exists in a capital market. Under this assumption, information obtained from the management level is considered as much more accurate and reliable than information obtained from the market (Shan and Taylor, 2014). Therefore, investors seek information transparency through corporate sustainability information; without it, they cannot respond quickly to make rational decisions about the most effective investment (Shan and Taylor, 2014). It is also assumed that CSD could lower companies’ capital costs (Li et al., 2013) as well as increase sales (Creyer, 1997), market share and brand value (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2005), because firms with a higher degree of sustainability engagement have.

higher propensity to outperform the non-sustainability performing firms (Dhaliwal et al., 2011).

Companies that disclose non-financial information signal their willingness to communicate with their stakeholders about sustainability issues that are unknown by the market (Yang, 2011), and companies produce stand-alone reports when the benefit of providing such disclosure outweighs the related costs. Companies with sound performance will deliver their positive image to the public and be distinguished examples among their peers.

The users of CSD, in general, include a broad range of company stakeholders, such as socially conscious customers, employees, non-governmental organisations, regulators, investors and financial analysts (Cordeiro and Tewari, 2015). In the context of China, signalling theory is relevant for evaluating the users’ perception of CSD in China because most of the ordinary companies in China have no experience and are not willing to disclose voluntary sustainability information (Shan and Taylor, 2014). However, they have increasingly received significant pressure from the public, the government and industrial associations, to disclose.

For companies that have produced sustainability reports, and those that plan to do so, it is still not clear which sustainability indicators are considered important to disclose by the report users in China. Only if users perceive a strong and significant relationship between relevant indicators in sustainability reports and long-term corporate performance, they will find the data in the reports as useful. Therefore, understanding users’ perceived importance of CSD is essential.

This provides motivations to us to assess the level of importance of the CSD in China from the users’ perspective. Considering that GRI guidelines are mostly used in China for sustainability reporting, in this study, we use sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to evaluate users’ perceived importance of each of the indicators. Respondents in this study are asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. The data are accordingly analysed to reflect the users’ perceived level of importance of the corporate environmental, economic and social information disclosures.

# Hypotheses

Accordingly, this study proposes the following set of hypotheses:

- H1. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate sustainability information disclosure as high.
- H1A. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate environmental information disclosure as high.
- H1B. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate economic information disclosure as high.
- H1C. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of corporate social information disclosure as high.

# 2.3.2 Chinese report users’ perspective on Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability indicators

While GRI guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reporting, there have been some concerns regarding the potentially different perceptions of the level of importance of the indicators listed on the GRI guidelines. Wang and Juslin (2009), for example, based on their literature study on terms of differences between the West and East contexts, claim that Western corporate sustainability concepts do not adapt well to the Chinese market, because they have rarely defined the primary reason for corporate sustainability. The ethic approach to the corporate sustainability concept does not take the Chinese reality and culture into consideration. They point out that corporate sustainability is a term that may be legitimately interpreted within the Chinese corporate culture. However, Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasise the “cultivation of virtue and morality, as well

as the core of its harmony notion” (Wang and Juslin, 2009, p. 446), offer a better understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context. Accordingly, there may be some of the indicators listed on GRI guidelines that are not relevant within the Chinese context, and hence, they are not considered as necessary by the Chinese report users. This study tries to evaluate whether it is indeed some differences in the way Chinese report users’ perceived level of importance of sustainability information indicators listed in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines than what are intended by the GRI by including the indicators in the GRI guidelines.

In this study, we use a Likert scale of 4 being “important” as the basis GRI score for each of the GRI indicators and compare it with the respondents’ mean values for each of the relevant indicators. A t-test is used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores, which indicates whether Chinese report users perceive the level of importance of sustainability information in GRI guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1 Questionnaire design

Billings and Halstead (2005) suggested that one of the best ways to obtain information about beliefs, behaviours, views and perceptions of individuals in the business world is to ask questions with closed ends. In this study, a Web-based questionnaire was designed based on sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The scale of GRI has been validated by Chow and Chen (2012), in which corporate sustainability construct was modelled in social, environmental and economic dimensions.

To verify the measurement scale, they adopted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modelling and confirmed the validity of the proposed GRI model. While Chow and Chen (2012) address the partial concerns of the validity of GRI from the preparer’s end, their results are limited to interpret the perception from the report users. According to Brown and Deegan (1998), materiality within the sustainability report is used to be the way of potential organisational financial risks by address concerns from various stakeholders. It is imperative to consider corporate sustainability also from the report users’ perception.

In our data collection, each respondent was asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. A five-point Likert scale was used because the scale is considered suitable to provide sufficient discrimination for most purposes and can be easily understood by respondents (Brace, 2004).

jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j

As the questionnaire was designed based on the structure of GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, there were 11 questions about environmental disclosure, 4 questions about economic disclosure and 28 questions about social disclosure. The questions were translated into Chinese with the assistance of professional translators. To ensure the accuracy of the translation, we wrote emails to the first 30 respondents who left their contact details at the end in our pilot study. We asked about their understanding of our questionnaires with the Chinese version of GRI attached. Overall the respondents found the questionnaires are well written, and we decided to continue the full sample data collection. Discrepancies, reliability and validity were studied and tested in a pilot test, which involved 30 financial analysts from China. Appropriate adjustments were made to suit the terms used in China and the local dialect and expressions in the language.

# 3.2 Sample data

In this study, financial analysts were used as the target respondents as corporate sustainability information has always been one of the valuable inputs for financial analysts to evaluate and to predict firm value (Lin, 2010). Lin (2010) suggested that financial analysts are experts who assess corporate policies and performance on various issues of sustainability in China and that financial analysts are considered to be the prime CSD users who influence other investors extensively. A good corporate sustainability reputation captured by financial analysts could improve companies’ brand value and reputation, which in turn could enhance the appeal of firm’s products to consumers (Brown and Dacin, 1997) and lead to increased sales (Dhaliwal, et al., 2012).

Our sample responses were obtained in 2015, a time when President Xi initiated his leadership in China by imposing a higher degree of national sustainable development through the National Congress and the National Plan (Zhang et al., 2018). Our target respondents were the financial analysts who worked at securities organisations that were registered on the China Securities Regulatory Commission (www.csrc.gov.cn). To approach the financial analysts as our study’s respondents, we sent an email to 200 financial managers who worked at these registered security companies. Their contact information was obtained online. Each manager was also asked to distribute our Web-based survey URL to their financial analysts. We received 129 usable responses. Table I shows the demographic information of the respondents of the survey.

# 3.3 Data analysis

In this study, we build on and extend the work of Chow and Chen (2012). Chow and Chen (2012) have indicated the validity of the scale by GRI from the report preparers’ end. We did a validity test by applying the EFA to explore the perceived importance of corporate sustainability reporting from the report users’ perceptive. EFA is commonly used for interpreting self-reporting questionnaires which have been widely used in existing perception and motivation-based CSR research (Dincer and Dincer, 2012; Firmialy and Nainggolan, 2018; Hayton et al., 2004; Latif et al., 2018; Sheng and Chen, 2010). We performed EFA because it reduces a large number of reflective and latent measures into a smaller set (Hair et al., 1995); hence, it confirms the dimensions defined by the GRI and fosters our hypotheses testing in the later part of the study. EFA also provides the significance of validity for the construct under the GRI based on our questionnaires (Hayton et al., 2004).

To test our hypotheses, we adopted t-tests to confirm the level of importance based on our questionnaire results. t-tests are commonly used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores. A one-sample t-test is often considered when only a single sample of the participants and the questions are used to determine whether the

The mean of the population from which the sample is drawn is the same as the hypothesised mean (Hair et al., 1995). In this study, one-sample t-test was adopted because the mean value drawn from the users’ perceived importance of each type of sustainability disclosure was compared with the level of importance intended by GRI (i.e. the value of 4 as per the Likert scale used).

# 4. Results and analysis

# 4.1 Exploratory factor analysis

Based on the definition of the sustainability items from GRI, we prepared reflective indicators in the questionnaires in terms of environmental indicators, economic indicators, social indicators – labour and decent work, social indicators – human rights, social indicators – society and social indicators – product responsibility. The estimation of the EFA results is presented in Table II. Unsurprisingly, EFA reveals six underlying dimensions, which are consistent with the sustainability definition by GRI. We follow the similar approach of Latif et al. (2018) in the critical assumption of EFA. Firstly, our correlation matrix shows that all items were significant at p < 0.001 level. Interestingly, we detect that “environment grievance” in the environmental indicator construct has a relatively low factor loading of 0.134. One explanation is that there were limited ways of environmental grievance in the Chinese context because of the lack of government monitoring controls over corporate environmental performance (Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, our result also suggests the suitability of factors with Bartlett’s test of sphericity (x² = 3698.805, df = 946 and p < 0.01) that measures the probability of the correlation matrix with other components, where the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure is 0.849 at 0.01 significance level. Lastly, we accounted for 51.885 per cent of the variation in our data based on the six factors yielded from the scales based on EFA. We further performed a reliability test, in which our Cronbach’s alphas are substantially above the critical value of 0.7. Based on the results from EFA, our results overall show sufficient convergent validity in each construct, which allows us to perform the following t-tests for hypothesis testing.

# 4.2 Perceived importance of the environmental indicators

Table III presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for environmental indicators, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. Five indicators are found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level: “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” with mean values of 4.51, 4.48, 4.46, 4.35 and 4.20, respectively. The results suggest that CSD report users in China perceived these five indicators more important than what were intended by the GRI. The t-test for the other seven indicators shows no significant results. For “effluents and waste”, “emissions” and “compliance”, the perceptions of the respondents were consistent with the recent trend of carbon offsets and carbon emissions.

in many major cities in China, which has gradually gained significant international attention. Carbon offset refers to a monetary investment that abates greenhouse gas emission or sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, which is used to compensate for greenhouse gas emission from companies’ own activities. To combat severe air pollution, Beijing, for example, has had “APEC-blue” sky, because the government temporarily shut down the industrial area in Hebei. The overall mean value for environmental indicators is 4.20 (out of 5). Hence, H1A was supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2A.

# 4.3 Perceived importance of the economic indicators

Table IV presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for economic indicators, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “indirect economic impacts” and “procurement practices” are found to be statistically significant at the 0.01 level, while “market presence” is found to be significant at the 0.05 level. The t-test for “economic performance” shows no significant result. Interestingly, the mean values for all four indicators are below the test value of 4, suggesting that all economic indicators were not perceived to be as important as they were intended to be in the GRI guidelines. The overall mean value for economic indicators is 3.79 (out of 5). Hence, both H1B and H2B were not supported.

# 4.4 Perceived importance of the social indicators

# 4.4.1 Social indicators – labour practice and decent work.

Table V presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of labour practice and decent work, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “Occupational health and safety” is found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level and it has a mean value of 4.22, indicating that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. In contrast, “Employment”

and “Diversity and equal opportunity” are found to be statistically significant at 0.05 level, but their mean values are less than the t-test value, meaning that they are considered less important. The t-test for the other three indicators shows no significant results. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of labour practice and decent work is 3.98 (out of 5), which is very close to the test value of 4.

# 4.4.2 Social indicators – human rights

Table VI presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of human rights, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. Nine out of the ten human rights indicators are found to be statistically significant at either the 0.05 or 0.01 level. However, the mean values show that some indicators are considered more important, while the others are considered less important. With regards to indicators that were perceived as more important than what were intended by GRI, “child labour” and “security practice” obtained higher mean values than the t-test value of 4. In contrast, “non-discrimination”, “freedom of association and collective bargaining”, “indigenous rights”, “investment”, “human rights grievance mechanisms”, “assessment” and “supplier human rights assessment” are perceived as less important by the CSD report users in China than they were intended to be by GRI. The t-test for “forced or compulsory labour” shows no significant result. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of human rights is 3.89 (out of 5), which is quite close to the test value of 4.

# 4.4.3 Social indicators – society

Table VII presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of society, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “Compliance” is found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level and it has a mean value of 4.16, indicating that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. In contrast, “anti-competitive behaviour”, “public policy”, “local community” and “supplier assessment for impacts on society” are found to be statistically significant at either 0.01 or 0.1 level, but their mean values are less than the t-test value, meaning that they are considered less important. The t-test for the other two indicators shows no significant results. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of society is 3.91 (out of 5), which is quite close to the test value of 4.

Note: t-test at 95% confidence interval; significant at 0.05 level; significant at 0.01 level

Responsibility indicators are found to be statistically significant at either the 0.01 or 0.05 level. The mean values show that three indicators are considered more important, while one indicator is considered less important. “Customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” are found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level with mean values of 4.36, 4.31 and 4.25, respectively. These indicate that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. On the other hand, “marketing communication” is found to be statistically significant at 0.05 level, but its mean value is less than the t-test value, meaning that it is considered less important. The t-test for “Product and service labelling” shows no significant result.

The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of society is 4.17 (out of 5), which is higher than the test value of 4.

# 4.4.5 Overall social indicators

The overall mean value for social indicators is 3.96 (out of 5), which is very close to the t-test value of 4. Hence, H1C can be considered as supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2C, with various detailed results for the indicators.

# 4.5 Overall perceived importance of the sustainability disclosure

The overall mean value for all indicators of sustainability disclosure is 4.10 (out of 5), which is higher than the t-test value of 4. Hence, H1 is supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2, with various detailed results for the indicators.

# 5. Discussion

In general, our findings of the users’ perceived importance of CSD indicate that the importance of CSD perceived by the report users in China was partially different from what was intended by GRI. The degrees of difference varied across disclosure categories. Our findings show evidence that there are moderate differences in the Chinese report users’.

perceived importance of environmental, economic and social disclosures from what were intended by the GRI. Environmental disclosure, with an overall mean value of 4.20 (out of 5), was perceived as more important by the users than what was intended by the GRI. Social disclosure, with an overall mean value of 3.96 (out of 5) can be considered as having the same level of importance by the users as what was intended by the GRI and, lastly, economic disclosure with a mean value of 3.79 (out of 5), was perceived as less important by the users than what was intended by the GRI.

As shown in Table IX, our results overall show consistency with the existing literature in the context, whereas partial differences are apparent comparing with Western individualistic contexts. Looking closer, environmental indicators that received a high level of perceived importance often relate to the most publicly concerning issues, such as energy, water, emission, effluents and waste in environmental disclosure in China. The results are consistent with literature both in China and Western countries. Lu and Abeysekera (2017) and Chow and Chen (2012) both used Chinese data and found that effluents and waste, emission, compliance and energy are significant from report preparers’ end. In our case, as the data were collected in 2014, a series of promotion on the corporate sustainability development was fostered by President Xi because of the change in leadership. While there is no mandatory requirement on corporate sustainability reporting, environmental control such as carbon emission reduction and energy saving have been incorporated in the National Plan and have been continuously promoted in the national Congress Zhang et al. (2018). This can also be influenced by the 12th Five Year Sustainability Plan by the Chinese government, in which companies were encouraged to disclose use of material, energy consumption and general environmental performance. Although adherence to the plan is on a voluntary basis, seemingly users wanted to see information regarding these areas being disclosed in annual and sustainability reports.

With regard to social disclosure, it is notable that “product responsibility” indicators generally received a high level of perceived importance. Product responsibility is another area of concern in China, because of prior severe food product faults and the milk powder scandal in the community. In comparison with existing research (Chow and Chen, 2012; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017), product safety on customer health was broadly found as an essential factor perceived by report preparers. It is evident that the concerns and the fear of product safety in China are far from resolved. While other social items (e.g. occupational health and safety, employment, security practice, indigenous rights, investment and compliance) also show high consistency with prior literature, the majority of the social related sustainability information was not perceived importantly because of their exclusion from regulations and the voluntary nature in the Western context (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Chow and Chen, 2012; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017).

Economic disclosure was perceived as less important in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. Information included in economic disclosure presents a measurement of the economic outcomes of a company and the effect and relevance of these outcomes on a broad range of stakeholders. As most of the economic disclosure can be obtained from the annual reports, it may be considered less relevant within the context of sustainability reporting, in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. However, economic disclosures were perceived to be much more important in the Western settings (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008; Rueda-Manzanares et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2007). This is consistent without discussion in Section 2.1 that the Western context considers sustainability as a way to stretch the wealth creation, thereby producing the long-term sustainable economic performance (Zhang et al., 2018). In our results, we detected negative associations, which indicate that economic information is considered less attractive because the disclosures may have been released in financial reports.

# 6. Conclusion

This study provides some evidence of the Chinese report users’ perceptions on the importance of GRI indicators of sustainability disclosure. Because of the unique cultural and political background that influence companies in China, our results offer significant

relevance to existing research into China’s corporate sustainability or social responsibility practices and reporting mechanisms. We found that the Chinese concerns on corporate sustainability are partially different from the Western context-based literature, as well as that from the GRI. The national pursuit of sustainability development engaged by the government has an inevitable influence to change and lead corporate stakeholders’ perception of corporate sustainability. The government as a dominance among social actors has a substantial impact on societal acceptance towards corporates, which has gradually embedded in the Chinese culture. We urge future research to consider the political, cultural and policy impact on society’s expectation when analysing the scope and the extent of corporate sustainability reporting in the Chinese context, especially when comparing results again the Western-based studies.

Our study is subjected to the following limitations. Firstly, this study has limited the collection of its data from financial analysts in China who are considered as prime CSD users. It is suggested that future research may include other relevant report users to further enhance the findings. Secondly, respondents’ perceptions may change over time, and hence a follow-up survey may be necessary to measure the response in a long-run. Thirdly, the differences in the perceived importance of CSD in different countries is possible to be linked with the levels of their development. Because of the political system in China, corporate stakeholders’ perceptions may be considerably influenced by state government. Hence, it could be important for future research to address this concern by including multi-national perceptions for comparisons.

# Abstract

Finance research has shaped the modern financial system, influencing investors and market participants directly through research findings and indirectly through teaching and training programmes. Climate change presents major risks to the global financial system as well as new opportunities for investors. Is climate finance an important topic in finance research? We systematically analyse the content of 20,725 articles published in the leading 21 finance journals between January 1998 and June 2015. We find that only 12 articles (0.06%) are related in some way to climate finance. The three elite finance journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies) did not publish a single article related to climate finance over the 17.5-year period. We repeat our analysis across a sample of 29 elite business journals spanning accounting, economics, management, marketing and operations research, as well as finance. We find a similar dearth of published climate finance research. We consider four possible explanations for this failure of top finance and business journals to engage with climate finance as a research topic. These include methodological constraints and editorial policies. We conclude by arguing why it is critical for climate-related research to be given greater attention and prominence in finance journals.

# 1 Introduction

Climate change presents both major risks to the global financial system and an opportunity for investors. Climate finance has become a defining topic in policy and practice, with major current debates around stranded fossil fuel assets, divestment from carbon-intensive stocks, the direct (physical) impact of climate change on assets, carbon markets, green investing and development finance, risk management strategies including climate insurance and broader.

financial stability risks (Dietz et al. 2016; Pauw et al. 2016; Batten et al. 2016; Griffin et al. 2015; Van Renssen 2014; Leaton 2011). There is no accepted taxonomy of climate finance, reflecting its emergent nature. However, common distinctions are made between mitigation or adaptation climate finance, and between public or private climate finance (Pauw et al. 2016).

In this paper, we explore whether climate finance is an important topic in finance research. Finance research is principally concerned with the functioning of private finance and so can help advance understanding of the interplay between financial markets and investors on the one hand and climate change on the other—be it related to mitigation or adaptation.

All the ‘core’ areas of finance research—asset pricing, corporate finance and investments—are relevant to climate change. As an illustrative example, the ‘asset pricing’ branch of finance research, which takes the perspective of traders, could help uncover to what degree investors are pricing carbon risk into asset values and is thus relevant to contemporary debates on stranded assets (Ansar et al. 2013; Carbon Tracker Initiative 2013, 2015; Dietz et al. 2016; Griffin et al. 2015; Leaton 2011). ‘Corporate finance’ researchers, who take the perspective of companies, could help establish whether energy majors have the balance sheets to support the financing of a capital-intensive low carbon transition (Tulloch et al. 2017). ‘Investments’ researchers can evaluate if climate-friendly investment funds or bonds outperform their alternatives on a risk-adjusted basis (Muñoz et al. 2014). Finance research in non-core areas can also contribute to understanding the relationships between private finance and climate change. Finance researchers concerned with insurance, risk management and financial institutions can help answer questions such as the following: what impact will rising sea levels have on real estate assets in large cities? What financial instruments can be used hedge carbon risk in investment portfolios? How exposed are banks to carbon risk, and banking systems more generally? (see Alexander 2014; Andersson et al. 2016; Batten et al. 2016; Carney 2015; Carbon Tracker Initiative 2013; de Jong and Nguyen 2016).

Leading climate change journals (including Nature Climate Change, Climatic Change and Global Environmental Change) have clearly engaged with climate finance topics (Dietz et al. 2016; Patenaude 2011; Pauw et al. 2016; Van Renssen 2014). One would similarly expect leading finance journals to have engaged with climate change.

We use systematic content analysis to identify climate change-related and climate finance-related articles in a sample of over 20,000 articles during a 17.5-year period since the Kyoto Protocol introduced global carbon markets. We repeat this analysis for a further sample of over 31,000 articles in elite business journals during the same time period to determine if our results are specific to finance journals, or are more broadly representative of accounting, economics, management and other business journals. Content analysis is a widely used method for characterising published textual material through simple quantitative descriptors such as the frequency of occurrence of a defined set of ‘codes’. The codes are linked to specific words, phrases or meanings of the textual content. Content analysis has recently been applied to large samples of journal articles to identify the disciplines, methods and concepts of energy-related social science (D’Agostino et al. 2011), the main findings of research on smart home technologies (Wilson et al. 2015) and the constituent types of low-carbon behaviour (Karlin et al. 2014).

We find a minimal level of engagement of finance and business journals with climate change-related and climate finance-related research, and we develop arguments as to why this might be the case. We conclude that this research gap is a major issue for advancing theory and practice in climate finance given the importance of finance research in shaping the modern financial system, in influencing investors and market participants and in teaching the next

generation of finance, investment, and business leaders. In so doing, we build on previous findings that business academics up to 2008 were slow to embrace climate change as a field of enquiry, although this research did not consider climate finance explicitly (Patenaude 2011; Goodall 2008).

# 2 Method: content analysis

We identified leading finance journals ranked B and above (Currie and Pandher 2011) and elite business journals rated 4* (ABS 2015). The samples comprised 21 finance journals (Table 1) and 29 elite business journals spanning accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing and operations research (Table 2). The top three finance journals were included in both samples (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies).

We used Scopus to search the content of these journals for articles on climate change (‘climate’ OR ‘global warming’ OR ‘greenhouse’ OR ‘carbon’). We searched titles, abstracts and keywords in all article types. The search period covered a 17.5-year period from January 1998 to June 2015. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in December 1997 and provides a clear milestone in international climate policy including the formation of carbon markets. All the journals in our two samples were indexed by Scopus over the full search period with three exceptions (Review of Finance, Quantitative Finance and Journal of Financial Research). Coverage of these journals in Scopus began in 2004, 2003 and 2003 respectively. We used journals’ own websites to search for articles in the period from January 1998 to these start dates to ensure no missing data.

A total of 36 articles in finance journals and 156 articles in elite business journals matched our search terms on climate change. We compiled metadata on all these articles and checked for spurious matches. Over half of all articles were spurious and not related to climate change (e.g. referring to a ‘changing economic climate’). Two members of the research team (IDR, BR) independently carried out these checks, with inter-coder reliability (Krippendorff’s alpha) of 0.8854. A bootstrap procedure generates lower and upper 95% CI of 0.7799 and 0.9600 respectively. Any coding differences were checked by the third member of the research team (CW) and resolved.

As shown in Fig. 1, our final samples comprised 12 articles in finance journals (after rejecting 24 spurious matches) and 74 articles in elite business journals (after rejecting 82 spurious matches).

To determine whether the articles in these final samples were related to climate finance, we searched the compiled metadata using a set of financial terms (‘financ*’ OR ‘balance sheet’ OR ‘asset’ OR ‘valu*’ OR ‘market’ OR ‘trade’ OR ‘trading’ OR ‘securit*’). A total of 12 (of 12) articles in leading finance journals and 25 (of 74) articles in elite business journals matched our climate finance-related search terms.

We coded each of these climate finance articles using a simple coding template which distinguishes key finance topics: (A) carbon markets; (B) value and performance (including stranded assets, green funds); (C) risk and risk mitigation (including hedging and insurance); (D) investments and opportunities (including green bonds); (E) corporate strategies (including carbon accounting, socially responsible investment) and (F) other (including carbon taxes, public climate finance). These topics were initially derived from an iterative process of reading the climate finance literature and reconciling this with established areas of finance research (for instance, commodity markets for topic A, risk management and insurance for topic C). For the

Number of climate change-related and climate finance-related articles in leading finance journals (top panel) and elite business journals (bottom panel). Note: Shaded areas are proportional to number of articles.

In coding, these topics were then refined and clearly defined so they were both discrete (non-overlapping) and exhaustive. In each case, we coded the main topic covered in the article.

To normalise our samples of climate change-related and climate finance-related articles, we used Scopus ‘Compare Journals’ statistics on the total number of articles published per journal.

A total of 20,725 articles were published in our sample of 21 finance journals from January 1998 to June 2015 (see Table 1).

A total of 31,351 articles were published in our sample of 29 elite business journals over the same time period (see Table 2).

# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260

To account for more recent interest in climate finance, particularly with respect to stranded assets, carbon bubbles and divestment, we created subsamples of articles published during the period January 2012 to June 2015 (see Appendix, Table 3). The Carbon Tracker published its first report in November 2011 which was a milestone in raising general awareness of climate finance topics (Leaton 2011).

# 3 Results

The results of our content analysis show a remarkable lack of engagement with climate change-related risks and opportunities by leading finance journals and elite business journals.

# 3.1 Climate change-related research

Table 1
shows that only 12 (0.06%) of the 20,725 articles published in the 21 leading finance journals (Currie and Pandher 2011) since 1998 have related in some way to climate change.

Furthermore, this almost complete lack of engagement with climate change as a research topic is not limited to finance. Table 2
similarly shows that only 74 (0.24%) of the 31,351 articles published by 4* ‘elite’ business journals (ABS 2015) over the same period addressed climate change-related issues (see also Fig. 1).
This research gap has scarcely improved in recent years as climate change has grown ever greater in relevance for finance. Over the period January 2012 to June 2015, only 0.10% (leading finance) and 0.49% (elite business) of articles published engaged with climate change (see Appendix, Table 3).

Among the elite business journals, we find that finance and marketing have not engaged with climate issues at all (see Table 2). We do find some limited engagement with climate change in elite journals from accounting, economics, management, operations research and ‘other’ business disciplines. Economics has engaged the most with climate topics, with all five elite journals having published at least one climate change-related paper and 0.5% of all publications addressing climate issues. However, it is noteworthy that of the 42 publications in economics, 36 come from one journal (America Economic Review). This highlights the importance of editorial policy in establishing journal norms (we return to this below).

The 21 leading finance journals have only published 12 climate change-related articles since 1998. Six of those were published since 2012 suggesting only a marginal increase in recent interest. Of the top ten journals, only the Journal of Banking and Finance has published climate-related articles (n = 4). The Journal of Risk and Insurance is the only other journal to have published more than one article (n = 2) (see Table 1). Other than the Journal of Banking and Finance, the journals that have published climate change-related articles tended to be towards the bottom of the ranking list. The three elite finance journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies) did not publish a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period. These findings are consistent with a recent review of ‘what’s hot’ in finance research for the four leading finance journals over the period 2011 to 2015 (see Bhattacharya et al. 2016). In the review, there is no mention of climate, carbon or environmental finance.

# 3.2 Climate finance-related research

All 12 climate change-related articles in leading finance journals were coded as also being climate finance-related. In addition, 25 of 74 climate change-related articles in elite business journals were similarly coded as being climate finance-related. Figure 1 summarises the coding of these climate finance-related articles. Just under half of the 37 climate finance-related articles addressed carbon markets; an additional 14% (the ‘other’ category) mainly addressed carbon taxes. This leaves an almost complete absence of research on critically important issues of risk, valuation (including stranded assets) and investment opportunities related to climate change.

We conclude overall that there is a dearth of climate finance-related research in leading finance journals, and that this small number of contributions are disproportionately focused on carbon markets. Elite business journals, in particular in the accounting, economics and operations research disciplines, have addressed climate finance-related topics to a very slightly greater extent (n = 25 vs. n = 12) and while these address a broader set of issues, they also tend to be dominated by research on carbon markets and carbon taxes (see Table 2).

It is instructive to provide some context for our headline findings that 0.06 and 0.08% of all articles published from 1998 to 2015 in leading finance journals and elite business journals respectively are on climate finance-related research. In other words, what other topics are finance journals covering? Financial intermediation (including banking and related regulatory issues) and market microstructure (the study of how exchange occurs in financial markets) respectively accounted for 8% and 3.7% of articles published in the Journal of Finance between 2011 and 2015 (Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Research on financial intermediation has clearly grown in importance due to the global financial crisis, while market microstructure has become more prominent as electronic and high-frequency trading have expanded across financial markets (see Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015). Both areas are distinct from the ‘core’ focus of finance research on asset pricing, corporate finance and investments, which together accounted for 67% of research in the Journal of Finance over the same period (Bhattacharya et al. 2016).

# 4 Discussion

It is striking that finance research is so ‘behind the climate curve’ given that investment professionals (Van Renssen 2014) and financial regulators (Batten et al. 2016; FSB 2016) are strongly engaged with climate finance topics. We offer four possible explanations.

First, contemporary critiques of finance research suggest the discipline is isolated and increasingly distanced from practice or the reality of financial markets (Focardi and Fabozzi 2012; Keasey and Hudson 2007). For instance, Focardi and Fabozzi (2012, pp. 108–109) observe that ‘[a] true empirical science would revise its models so that they fit empirical data. Financial economics, however, takes the opposite approach and considers deviations from an idealized economic rationality to be anomalies of the true empirical price processes’. Similarly, Keasey and Hudson (2007) observe that finance researchers are reluctant to engage with practice, leading them to conclude that finance theory is ‘a house without windows’. Accordingly, finance researchers seeking to publish in leading finance journals may be unaware of climate finance-related issues worthy of research attention. Among the leading finance journals, the two which are most practitioner-oriented have both published climate change-related articles. These are the Financial Analysts Journal (the Chartered Financial Analysts

# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260

Institute’s journal) and the Journal of Portfolio Management. Proximity to finance practice, and in particular to institutional investors, may help support engagement with climate change. Indeed, in 2016 (beyond our sample period), there have been two notable climate finance risk-related publications in the Financial Analysts Journal, namely Andersson et al. (2016) and de Jong and Nguyen (2016). The five authors involved in these two publications were practitioners or practitioners with ties to universities. None were ‘conventional’ finance academics.

Second, finance is essentially a mono method discipline (applied empiricism encased in rational agent theory) which is ill-suited to tackling forward-looking challenges arising from dynamic system change (Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015; Focardi and Fabozzi 2012; Keasey and Hudson 2007). This ‘limited domain’ problem (Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015) may explain why the climate finance-related research that has been published in leading finance journals has tended to focus on carbon markets, as rich time-series datasets are readily available. If so, leading finance journals face fundamental epistemological challenges to remain relevant within the climate context.

Third, incentives within finance research publication may steer academics away from climate finance topics. There may be a perception among finance academics that climate finance-related topics do not provide the opportunities for high impact general theory development that ‘core’ research in asset pricing, corporate finance and investments allows for and which tend to dominate the leading finance journals (see earlier discussion, and Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Further, established research agendas and high teaching loads among finance academics in universities may create inertia. There is high demand to study finance and a limited pool of faculty talent, partly as a result of alternative career opportunities in the finance industry. Thus, rather than undertaking ‘risky’ research in new fields such as climate finance that leading editors may not be receptive to, busy finance researchers focus on incremental knowledge in clearly recognised fields (Goodall 2008).

Fourth, and related to the previous points, researchers’ concerns that editors will not be responsive to climate finance topics may be well founded. This in turn may be related to leading finance professors (and journal editors) considering climate topics to be overly politicised (Goodall 2008). This effect may be accentuated by the US dominance of the finance discipline given the greater polarisation of views about, and scepticism towards, climate change in the US (Boussalis and Coan 2016; Painter and Ashe 2012; McCright and Dunlap 2011; Goodall 2008).

To explore this argument further, we identified the domiciles of the editorial teams of the 21 leading finance journals in our sample. We included co-editors, managing editors and executive editors but excluded associated editors. We assigned 0 (‘US’) or 1 (‘INT’) to a dummy variable coding for editorial teams that were exclusively US-based or that included at least one non-US domiciled editor respectively (see Appendix, Table 4). Of the 12 journals coded as international (INT), most included a combination of US and non-US editors reflecting the US dominance of the discipline. Only two journals had no US-based editors (Journal of Portfolio Management and Journal of Business Finance and Accounting). The phi coefficient of our dummy variable for all journals with at least one climate change-related publication and the INT dummy was 0.481 (significant at the 5% level). Leading finance journals publishing climate change-related research were categorised as having international editorial teams in all but one case (Journal of Futures Markets). We thus find a positive and statistically significant relationship between international editorial teams in leading finance journals and climate change-related research publications. This does not prove causality but does at least suggest that exclusively US-based editorial teams may play a role in limiting climate change-related research in leading finance journals.

# 5 Conclusion

Respected field journals such as Energy Economics have engaged strongly with climate finance-related research (Griffin et al. 2015). There are many climate finance initiatives in academia, including the Oxford Stranded Assets Programme and the new Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment, although tellingly the former is based in a geography department and the latter is not ranked by the business journal ranking lists (ABS 2015). So to be clear, we are not arguing that researchers are not engaging with climate finance. Rather, our concern is that elite business journals and leading finance journals have either not engaged at all or only engaged in a very limited sense. This has important implications for policy and practice.

High-profile publications in leading journals are important both for impact and academic career progression. Finance research is no different. Indeed, rewards and prestige in finance research are particularly concentrated (Currie and Pandher 2011; Fishe 1998) in the three elite journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). As noted earlier, none of these journals published a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period of our sample. Emphasising their importance to the pursuit of knowledge generally, the three leading finance journals are placed among the top 100 journals in the world for all disciplines (according to 2016 SJR rankings).

Meaningful action to understand and address the impacts of climate change on the financial system requires the engagement of the best minds from academic finance and the attention of the leading journals that define the agendas in their fields. Leading finance journals should be publishing research on a range of climate finance-related topics including risks (e.g. speculative bubbles, financial contagion), valuation (e.g. carbon-risk disclosure requirements and related market impacts across numerous asset classes), opportunities (e.g. debt and equity market ‘green’ financing) and corporate strategies (e.g. divestments and used of hedging instruments).

Until the top journals in finance and business signal that they are receptive to climate finance-related research, the best finance researchers are unlikely to engage. Since the articles from leading finance journals tend to underpin the finance curriculums of undergraduate and especially postgraduate qualifications in finance, perhaps the most prominent impact of the dearth of climate finance-related research in leading finance journals is that the next generation of finance practitioners may be underprepared to tackle climate change-related issues.

What might be done to alleviate this situation? First, there needs to be a better understanding of why leading finance journals have not engaged with climate change. We have offered several possible explanations above, but surveys or interviews of finance academics could provide substantiating evidence. Roundtables and seminars where senior finance academics (especially editors) are introduced to climate finance topics might also help. In this respect, professional and regulatory bodies engaged with climate finance issues could play an important role in bringing academics to the table. The Chartered Financial Analysts Institute and the Financial Stability Board (especially its Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) could be possible conduits. Finally, research funders can help by creating dedicated funding streams for climate finance issues that require interdisciplinary teams including finance researchers.

Through the data and analysis presented here, we do not in any way seek to diminish finance research. We hope it can provide a stimulus to encourage leading finance researchers to engage with climate change and the many financial risks and opportunities it creates. That way, climate finance topics can benefit from the knowledge, methods and insights in finance research. This in turn will lead to better policymaking in what is surely one of the defining topics for finance and capital markets in the coming years and decades.

# Abstract

This study develops the concept of Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility (Strategic CSR) by meta-analyzing the available empirical evidence on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP). Using meta-analytic structural equation modeling on effect size data from 344 primary studies, our study documents four empirical mechanisms explaining how CSR positively affects CFP: by 1) enhancing firm reputation, 2) increasing stakeholder reciprocation, 3) mitigating firm risk, and 4) strengthening innovation capacity. We propose these four mechanisms to identify four causally relevant attributes that allow us to conceptually distinguish Strategic CSR from CSR more generally. Our findings indicate that this article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

that the four mechanisms combined explain 20 percent of the CSR-CFP relationship, suggesting that considerable room remains for future empirical research. The development of an empirically informed, causal conceptualization of Strategic CSR responds to a long-heard call for better-specified concepts in empirical CSR research.

# INTRODUCTION

The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has inspired empirical research in management for almost half a century (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012). Early empirical CSR research initially had the (often only implicit) ambition of showing that the socially beneficial activities denoted by the CSR concept could be strategically justified by their positive performance implications for the firms undertaking them (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995). Orlitzky and colleagues (2003) synthesized the findings of 52 primary studies on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) produced in these early years. By documenting a small positive association between CSR and CFP, they corroborated that CSR can indeed be justified strategically.

Over the last two decades, however, CSR research has shifted its focus from investigating the CSR-CFP relationship as a whole to identifying the concrete empirical mechanisms through which CSR activities affect firm-level financial outcomes. This shift seems to have been motivated by three reasons. First, the documentation of a small positive relationship between CSR and CFP by Orlitzky and colleagues (2003) obviated the justificatory ambition to show that CSR mattered, thereby making room for the explanatory question of how CSR mattered instead (Barnett, 2007; Wang, Tong, & Takeuchi, 2016).

Second, scholars became increasingly critical of the coarse-grained and over-inclusive approach to conceptualizing CSR, which produced a concept referring to a diverse set of empirical phenomena (Gond & Crane, 2010). As a response, finer-grained research was increasingly undertaken, focusing on specific types of CSR activities and their indirect effect on firm performance (Flammer, 2013; King & Lenox, 2002; Wang & Qian, 2011). Third, CSR research became methodologically more sophisticated as scholars started to use more advanced research designs (Flammer, 2013, 2015; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016), better data (Henisz, Dorobantu, & Nartey, 2014; Lev, Petrovits, & Radhakrishnan, 2010; Zhao & Murrell, 2016), and more rigorous analytical techniques (Cheng, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Surroca, Tribó, & Waddock, 2010), that required a shift towards more focused research questions (Godfrey, Merril, & Hansen, 2009; Koh, Qian, & Wang, 2014; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016).

As individual CSR-CFP studies became finer-grained and more focused, however, the field as a whole became more fragmented. A diverse and growing body of empirical findings has emerged identifying a wide variety of empirical mechanisms linking CSR to CFP. One of the most persistent conceptual critiques on CSR involved its lack of theoretical foundations (Ullmann, 1985), resulting in a poorly specified construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995) that has highly permeable boundaries (Lockett, Moon, & Visser, 2006). This has led some scholars to claim that CSR hardly meets even the most basic requirements for explanatory concepts in social science (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). Although several attempts at conceptual clarification were made (Clarkson, 1995; Swanson, 1995; Windsor, 2006), scholars seem to have accepted that CSR is better conceived of as an umbrella term rather than a well-defined theoretical concept (Gond & Crane, 2010). But as empirical research on CSR and on the CSR-CFP relationship continues to proliferate, the absence of a well-defined theoretical concept increasingly hinders the development of the field (Lockett et al.).

al., 2006; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006; Pfeffer, 1993), since a minimal degree of consensus regarding the defining features of a concept is required for scholars to effectively engage with each other to advance common knowledge (Kuhn, 1962; Suddaby, 2010).

Within the general field of CSR research, we focus specifically on the stream of research investigating the CSR-CFP relationship in order to isolate and develop the concept of “Strategic CSR”. Following Goertz’ (2006) causal approach to explanatory concepts in social science, we develop a three-level conceptual structure of the concept of Strategic CSR in an effort to identify its causally most relevant properties for explaining financial performance differentials between firms.

We review the empirical CSR-CFP literature, and ask three questions about the current state of research. First, what do we currently know about how CSR affects firm financial outcomes? Specifically, what are the most important empirical mechanisms through which the variety of CSR activities investigated in the literature affect CFP? Second, does our current knowledge about how CSR activities affect CFP ‘exhaust’ the overall CSR-CFP relationship, that is, is the relationship between CSR and CFP fully explained (i.e. fully mediated) by the four empirical mechanisms that we identify in this study? Third, based on the findings of this study, what potentially fruitful avenues can we suggest for future research on (Strategic) CSR?

We answer these questions using advanced meta-analytic techniques on the empirical evidence accumulated over five decades of empirical CSR-CFP research. Based on a review of the literature, we identify four theoretical mechanisms for which empirical evidence is sufficiently available. We then use meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM: Bergh, Aguinis, Heavey, Ketchen, Boyd, Su, Lau, & Joo, 2016) on a combined sample of 402,863 firm-year observations retrieved from 344 empirical studies to provide a simultaneous meta-analytic test of the four empirical mechanisms identified.

We seek to make three contributions to the CSR literature. First, we synthesize the growing and increasingly fragmented body of research on the relationship between CSR and CFP. We document four mechanisms through which CSR activities may contribute to the financial bottom line of firms: firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, risk mitigation, and innovation capacity. Second, we rely on these four mechanisms to theoretically develop the concept of Strategic CSR by defining it in terms of its causally most relevant attributes in explaining CFP. By developing an evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR that can be isolated and carved out from the conceptual domain of CSR more generally, we respond to the long-heard call for better-specified concepts in CSR research around which CSR researchers may unite and contribute to the development of a shared paradigm (Gond & Crane, 2010; Jones, 1995; Lockett et al., 2006). Third, our findings serve as a guide for future CSR-CFP research, both in terms of establishing what we already know and in identifying possible avenues for innovative research contributions still to be made.

# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The concept of CSR initially developed in the context of a normative debate, as much of the early CSR literature evolved around the normative question whether firms have an obligation to promote social betterment over and above their economic and legal obligations (Carroll, 1999; Frederick, 1994; Matten, Crane, & Chapple, 2003). In this debate, CSR was mostly residually conceptualized as socially valuable firm activities not required by law or shareholder interests (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), which explains the coarse and over-inclusive meaning that the concept subsequently acquired in the literature (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). The move to position CSR as a positive explanatory concept emerged from one particular line of argument in this debate; that CSR activities can be strategically justified because, next to promoting socially beneficial outcomes, they will also positively affect CFP.

(Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995). In support of this argument, an entire stream of empirical CSR-CFP research emerged. Since its inception, however, the concept of CSR has met with various critiques. Referred to as a(n) “contestable” (Windsor, 2006, p. 93), “elusive” (Clarkson, 1995, p. 92), and even “epiphenomenal” concept (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008, p. 210), the main concern has always been that CSR is theoretically poorly defined (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Ullmann, 1985; Wood & Jones, 1995) and therefore does not satisfy even the most basic requirements for explanatory concepts in social science.

# A causal approach to conceptualizing Strategic CSR

To carve out and further develop the explanatory concept of Strategic CSR from the conceptual domain denoted by the concept of CSR more generally, we follow Goertz’ (2006) causal approach to concept formation. Arguing that explanatory concepts in social science are essentially constructed from our causal knowledge on how the phenomenon denoted by the concept interacts with other phenomena, Goertz proposes to define explanatory social science concepts in terms of their causally most relevant general attributes. This causal approach is also a positivist approach to concept formation, because the causally most relevant attributes that jointly define a concept can only be identified through empirical research on the mechanisms through which the phenomenon interacts with other phenomena (a process sometimes referred to as ‘nomological validation’ (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955)).

Empirically validated causal propositions that prior research has found to explain social reality are therefore deeply embedded in explanatory social science concepts, and can be used to foster an ever better theoretical understanding of these concepts themselves.

As the bulk of empirical research has used the CSR concept to explain CFP, we are able to develop an understanding of Strategic CSR by identifying those general attributes of CSR that prior research has found to be causally most relevant in explaining CFP. The concept of

# Strategic CSR

Strategic CSR was first coined by Baron (2001), and subsequently developed further by McWilliams and Siegel (2001) and Waldman and colleagues (2006), who explicitly connected it to the strategic management field’s academic objective of explaining firm competitive advantages from observed performance differentials between firms (Nelson, 1991; Rumelt, Schendel, & Teece, 1991). The development of strategic management concepts by inferring them from performance differentials between firms is an established conceptualization strategy in the strategic management literature and has been foundational for some of the field’s core theories and concepts (for example, the resource-based view: Barney, 1991, 2001; Priem & Butler, 2001; and dynamic capabilities: Winter, 2003; Zahra, Sapienza, & Davidsson, 2006).

It is also a useful strategy to conceptually demarcate and carve out Strategic CSR from the empirical domain denoted by the CSR concept more generally, as there may also exist CSR activities that do not enhance CFP (Wright & Ferris, 1997). Our conceptualization strategy to demarcate Strategic CSR from CSR more generally is graphically illustrated by the Venn diagram in Figure 1. The outer rectangle captures the universe of all firm activities. Within this universe, CSR activities are those firm activities that “appear to further some social good” (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001, p. 117). Within the set of CSR activities more generally, there are some CSR activities that positively contribute to firm performance and some that do not. Only the former are part of the empirical domain denoted by the concept of Strategic CSR. We aim to further develop the concept of Strategic CSR by unveiling the mechanisms through which CSR contributes to CFP, and which identify the causally most relevant attributes of Strategic CSR.

To identify the general attributes of Strategic CSR, we survey five decades of empirical research on the CSR–CFP relationship. While early empirical research investigated the direct relationship between CSR and CFP (Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Cochran & Wood, 1984; Mcguire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), more recent research has documented that the relationship is mediated by other strategically relevant variables (Surroca et al., 2010). By surveying the available research, we seek to uncover the most important mediating mechanisms through which CSR has been found to affect CFP. We focus only on those mechanisms for which sufficient primary studies are available to test the hypotheses developed through our review using MASEM (Bergh et al., 2016). This leads us to identify four empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to affect CFP, that is, through: 1) enhanced firm reputation, 2) stakeholder reciprocation, 3) risk mitigation, and 4) improved innovation capacity.

Below, we review the literature on these four mechanisms, and conclude each subsection with articulating a hypothesis that theoretically predicts how CSR affects CFP through this mechanism. We propose that these four mechanisms are conceptually and empirically distinct and identify four different causally relevant general attributes of Strategic CSR. Because our survey suggests that these four mechanisms are the main mechanisms through which CSR has been documented to affect CFP, we also conjecture that they jointly identify the causally relevant general attributes of the Strategic CSR concept exhaustively. We test this conjecture by introducing a fifth hypothesis predicting that the CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by these four mechanisms.

# HYPOTHESES/DEVELOPMENT

# The enhanced firm reputation mechanism

One well-researched empirical mechanism through which CSR has been found to affect CFP involves reputation enhancement. This mechanism captures the strategic benefits of CSR that result from stakeholders perceiving the firm as a more attractive partner to do business with (Boyd, Bergh, & Ketchen, 2010; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Turban and Greening (1997) were among the first to demonstrate this effect empirically, showing that a strong CSR rating increases firm attractiveness to prospective employees. Subsequent research corroborated this finding by uncovering that a firm’s involvement in CSR activities signals organizational norms and values, which influences prospective employees’ perceptions of the working conditions at the firm (Backhaus, Stone, & Heiner, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000), and increases their willingness to be associated with the firm (Jones, Willness, & Madey, 2014).

Firms signal their CSR activities to stakeholders through their advertising or via external “infomediaries” (Carter, 2006; Deephouse & Heugens, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Schuler & Cording, 2006). A CSR activity for which the effect on reputation is particularly well established, for example, is philanthropic donations (Brammer & Millington, 2005; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Lev et al., 2010; Williams & Barrett, 2000). Such CSR activities are strategically useful because they attract attention and evoke positive attributions by stakeholders (Godfrey, 2005; Groza, Pronschinske, & Walker, 2011). Firms are sometimes criticized for using CSR to convey a positive image without making material changes within the firm (Haack, Schoeneborn, & Wickert, 2012; Marquis & Qian, 2014; Wickert, Scherer, & Spence, 2016). For example, firms may use corporate philanthropy symbolically, to divert attention away from potential misconduct or to buy goodwill after being accused of misconduct (Du, 2015; Koehn & Ueng, 2010).

For the reputation

enhancement mechanism to be enacted, however, all that is required is that CSR activities target a broad audience and are visible to both existing and prospective stakeholders.

stakeholders are more attracted to CSR firms, these firms have access to a larger pool of stakeholders with whom they can develop productive relationships (Greening & Turban, 2000). Research has also shown that CSR reputations may enhance CFP. Because many customers, for example, are more attracted to and derive more satisfaction from purchasing products or services from CSR firms (Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006; Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001), which increases their purchasing intention (Sen, Bhattacharya, & Korschun, 2006), as well as their willingness to pay premium prices (Homburg, Koschate, & Hoyer, 2005; Marín, Rubio, & Ruiz De Maya, 2012). Investors have also been shown to be more attracted to CSR firms. While investment analysts used to give negative investment recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings in the early nineties, they often perceive CSR as a legitimate and even positive signal of a firm’s future profitability today (Ioannou & Serafeim, 2015). Indeed, share prices often increase after the public announcement of CSR initiatives (Arya & Zhang, 2009; Ramchander, Schwebach, & Staking, 2012). We therefore hypothesize:

# Hypothesis 1:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by firm reputation: CSR is positively related to firm reputation, and firm reputation is positively related to CFP.

# The stakeholder reciprocation mechanism

A second mechanism involves stakeholder reciprocation. When firms engage in CSR, they take actions that benefit at least certain stakeholder groups (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Stakeholders reciprocate by endorsing the firm, resulting in more cooperative, productive, and enduring relationships (Bosse, Phillips, & Harrison, 2009; Bosse & Coughlan, 2016; Jones, 1995). In contrast to the reputation enhancement mechanism, for this path to operate.

The adopted CSR activities must specifically benefit the firm’s existing stakeholders, but need not be visible externally.

Stakeholders while also increasing CFP. Employees of CSR firms benefit from practices such as fair pay, a safer work environment, and professional development opportunities (El Research has documented various ways in which CSR activities create value for Akremi, Gond, Swaen, De Roeck, & Igalens, 2018). In turn, they experience greater job satisfaction (De Roeck, El Akremi, & Swaen, 2016), exude higher levels of organizational commitment (Ali, Rehman, Ali, Yousaf, & Zia, 2010; Brammer, Millington, & Rayton, 2007), and engage more in organizational citizenship behaviors (Bode, Singh, & Rogan, 2015; Hansen, Dunford, Boss, Boss, & Angermeier, 2011). Firms profit from such motivated employees, not only because they are more productive, but also because firms can contract with them based on trust, which substantially decreases contracting costs (Jones, 1995).

A firm’s suppliers of financial capital also reciprocate CSR activities. Research has found that high CSR firms tend to engage in elaborate voluntary reporting (Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang, & Yang, 2011), which reduces information asymmetry and agency costs (Cheng et al., 2014). As a result, debtholders, institutional investors, and other equity providers are willing to offer their resources to the firm at more favorable terms (Cheng et al., 2014; Dhaliwal et al., 2011; El Ghoul, Guedhami, Kwok, & Mishra, 2011).

Local communities and government bodies may similarly endorse the firm in CFP-enhancing ways (Frooman, 1999). Governments depend on a public mandate, which incentivizes them to scrutinize the firms in their jurisdictions for how they handle and affect community interests (Doh & Guay, 2006). Higher levels of community endorsement resulting from CSR may thus lead to more favorable regulatory and enforcement conditions for the firm (Campbell, 2007; Sharma & Henriques, 2005) and higher levels of public procurement (Flammer, 2018; den Hond, Rehbein, de Bakker, & Lankveld, 2014). Communities may also...

reciprocate by granting CSR firms a societal license to operate (Henisz et al., 2014; Prno & Slocombe, 2012). For example, firms in extraction industries often sign community benefit agreements, which are contracts between the firm and local communities stating how firms compensate communities for the social and environmental disruptions they will cause (Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017). In the absence of such initiatives, firms may face persistent stakeholder conflicts resulting in a depreciation of intangible assets and investor skepticism (Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017; Henisz et al., 2014). CSR may thus have beneficial effects on a firm’s existing stakeholder relationships, leading to stakeholder reciprocation and higher levels of CFP. Hence:

# Hypothesis 2:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by stakeholder reciprocation: CSR is positively related to stakeholder reciprocation, and stakeholder reciprocation is positively related to CFP.

# The risk mitigation mechanism

CSR firms are involved with a broader set of issues and engage with more diverse stakeholder groups than firms focusing strictly on their core business and operations (Hart & Sharma, 2004). With this broader perspective, firms can access new information that can be used to reduce firm-specific risk. Indeed, a prior meta-analysis has found a negative relationship between CSR and firm risk (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). More recent research supports this conclusion (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Lee & Faff, 2009; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009; Oikonomou, Brooks, & Pavelin, 2012), showing that stock price crash risk (Kim, Li, & Li, 2014) and firm default risk (Sun & Cui, 2014; Verwijmeren & Derwall, 2010) are both reduced by CSR activities.

There are two main explanations of how CSR can reduce risk. CSR may directly mitigate risk because many CSR activities are especially designed to avoid harm to

stakeholders. Such activities are for instance, pollution prevention practices, employee health and safety programs, and fair-trade policies. Implementing these initiatives can reduce the firm’s risk exposure. ISO 14001 certification, for example, requires that firms have clear systems in place for monitoring and measuring environmental performance, creating awareness and competence among all employees, and organizing for emergency preparedness and response (Morrow & Rondinelli, 2002).

CSR may also indirectly reduce firm risk. Through CSR, firms can develop closer relationships with their stakeholders, which makes them more willing to share information with these firms (Harrison, Bosse, & Phillips, 2010). CSR can thus prove instrumental for sensing changes or threats, as stakeholders may transmit early-warning signs to managers (Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Volkswagen’s emission-scandal, for example, was partly caused by its authoritative corporate culture, which made employees afraid of questioning targets or sharing bad news with their superiors (Cremer & Bergin, 2015). Had Volkswagen fostered open and collaborative relationships with its employees, these problems might have been resolved before materializing into a costly public scandal. Thus, stakeholder relationships enable firms to anticipate and prevent foreseeable risks (Klassen & Vereecke, 2012; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016; Porter & Kramer, 2007).

Lower firm-specific risk creates value not because it directly generates higher CFP, but because it helps to preserve it (Choi & Wang, 2009; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Being implied in misconduct exposes firms to direct legal expenses such as litigation costs, administrative fines, and criminal sanctions, but also to indirect expenses such as turnover of key personnel, refinancing costs, and forgone sales (Karpoff & Lott, 1993; Koh et al., 2014). Because CSR firms are able to identify threats early on and correct potentially illegal acts, they can prevent these costs (Mcguire et al., 1988; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). In sum, firms that engage in CSR are more risk-aware, allowing them to manage and mitigate these risks.

more effectively. Lower firm-specific risk, in turn, reduces the likelihood that firms incur unproductive costs that burden CFP. Hence:

# Hypothesis 3:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by firm risk: CSR is negatively related to firm risk, and firm risk is negatively related to CFP.

# The improved innovation capacity mechanism

Scholars have long recognized the potential of CSR to be a lever of innovation and competitive differentiation (Husted & Salazar, 2006; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Because firms that engage in CSR tend to adopt a broader perspective and develop closer relationships with stakeholders, they are better able to identify new opportunities (Harrison et al., 2010; Tantalo & Priem, 2016). Close relationships with external stakeholders such as local communities, customers, and environmental groups for example, offer new knowledge pools that can become an important source of innovation (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Hart, 1995; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Good relationships with internal stakeholders are also important for innovation. Employees may be more willing to share information with the firm (Aragón-Correa, Martín-Tapia, & Hurtado-Torres, 2013; Harrison et al., 2010), and be better able to overcome the sort of short-term orientation that tends to impede innovation (Flammer & Kacperczyk, 2016; Wang & Bansal, 2012).

Another reason why CSR may enhance the firm’s innovativeness is that the adoption of many CSR activities requires the development of existing innovation capabilities or triggers the creation of new capabilities. The extent of a firm’s absorptive capacity (Delmas, Hoffmann, & Kuss, 2011; Luo & Du, 2015) and presence of complementary assets (Christmann, 2000), for example, facilitate the successful implementation of CSR. Researchers have established that firms adopting proactive environmental strategies tend to engage in higher-order learning and continuous innovation (Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998).

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

which may result in the development of new dynamic capabilities (Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003). Danone, a food products multinational, offers an illustrative example. Since the early 2000s the firm has been launching base of the pyramid projects in rural areas of developing countries. These initiatives were an important source of strategic renewal, as it encouraged experimentation and learning within Danone, and allowed it to develop unique expertise in creating low-cost solutions (Faivre-Tavignot & Dalsace, 2014).

The relationships between innovation, absorptive capacity, and CFP are well established in the strategy literature (Tsai, 2001; Zahra & George, 2002), but there is increasing evidence for the presence of these relationships in the CSR context as well (Delmas et al., 2011; Tang, Hull, & Rothenberg, 2012). Innovations resulting from a firm’s engagement with stakeholders can enhance CFP in at least three ways. First, CSR offers a powerful means of product differentiation (Flammer, 2015b; Hull & Rothenberg, 2008; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Siegel & Vitaliano, 2007). Second, radical process innovations, especially in the context of environmental management, may reduce both waste and production costs (Christmann, 2000; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand & Romi, 2013; King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Finally, as illustrated by the Danone example, CSR initiatives may lead to new business models and offer completely new sources of value creation (Hart & Christensen, 2002; Hart & Sharma, 2004). Therefore:

# Hypothesis 4:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by innovation capacity: CSR is positively related to innovation capacity, and innovation capacity is positively related to CFP.

Does our current knowledge allow an exhaustive conceptualization of Strategic CSR? Thus far, we have theoretically unveiled and articulated four broad empirical mechanisms through which prior empirical research has suggested CSR to improve CFP. We propose that

these four mechanisms identify the four causally relevant properties of Strategic CSR. In developing explanatory concepts in social science, it is not only important to incorporate the available knowledge about a phenomenon into its conceptual understanding, but also to establish whether this understanding is more or less complete in terms of accounting for the available empirical evidence. Methodologically, this implies assessing whether the four empirical mechanisms identified thus far fully mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP. If not, the implication is that there is at least one alternative causal path connecting CSR and CFP, which is currently absent from our theorizing. To determine whether the current conceptualization of Strategic CSR is indeed exhaustive, we therefore tentatively hypothesize that the CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by the four empirical mechanisms identified above:

# Hypothesis 5:

The CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity.

# METHODS

# Sample and coding

We used five search strategies to identify CSR-CFP studies. First, we read review articles (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams et al., 2006) and prior meta-analyses (Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2007; Orlitzky, 2015). Second, we examined six electronic databases: (1) ABI/INFORM Global, (2) Business Source Premier, (3) JSTOR, (4) Google Scholar, (5) ECONLIT, and (6) SSRN, using search terms such as: ‘corporate social responsibility’, ‘corporate social performance’, ‘ethical investment’, and ‘green investment fund.’ Third, we manually searched 15 leading journals in management and finance, including: Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Corporate Finance, Journal of Management Studies, and Strategic Management Journal. Fourth, we emailed all researchers who had written empirical studies.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

papers on CSR and CFP with missing effect-size information, asking them for a correlation table and any studies we could not retrieve by other means. Finally, using a two-way ‘snowballing’ technique, we backward-traced all references reported in the identified articles and forward-traced all articles that cited the original articles via Google Scholar. These five search strategies yielded a final sample of 344 primary studies. Of these, 296 were published journal articles and 48 were working papers at the time of our analysis. The publication window ranged from 1978 to 2016.

We then developed a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) for extracting effect size and sample size information for all the variables in our study, including dependent, independent, mediator, and control variables. One author coded all effect sizes. To assess inter-rater agreement, a second rater coded a subsample of 200 randomly selected effect sizes, after which we computed a chance agreement-corrected measure of inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa coefficient; Cohen, 1960). With a value of 0.90, kappa signified high inter-rater agreement (cf. Van Essen, Otten, & Carberry, 2015; Klier, Schwens, Zapkau, & Dikova, 2017).

# Measurement

Table 1 provides a description of all our variables. Existing studies have used many different measures for CSR, including both composite indices and single-item measures such as emission reductions (e.g. King & Lenox, 2002) or philanthropic donations (e.g. Zhang, Rezaee, & Zhu, 2010). We included all CSR measures in our study. CFP is operationalized using accounting-based measures such as Return on Equity (ROE) or Return on Assets (ROA), or market-based measures such as Tobin’s Q or market-to-book ratio. To measure firm reputation we included both third-party assessments such as expert ratings and firm expenditures on reputation building (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Stakeholder reciprocation has not been measured before.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

In primary studies, so we constructed this measure by capturing any manifestation of positive reciprocal behavior by stakeholders (Bosse & Phillips, 2016), such as employee commitment, customer satisfaction, and the involvement of government, institutional, or inside investors in the firm’s ownership structure. Firm risk was typically measured as variability in financial performance (e.g. Jensen’s beta or the standard deviation of stock returns). To capture innovation capacity we used both generic measures, such as the fraction of R&D expenses over sales, as well as more CSR-specific ones, such as the degree of environmental innovativeness.

We include several control variables in our analysis. We include prior CFP, since research has shown that this variable affects CSR through the mechanism of organizational slack, as well as current CFP through momentum effects (Waddock & Graves, 1997). We control for firm size, as larger firms tend to be more prone to invest in CSR and profit from it because of the economies of scale involved in the acquisition and deployment of CSR-related resources (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). We include firm leverage because prior CSR research has shown that resource availability is an important predictor of firms’ ability to profit from CSR (Brammer & Millington, 2008). Finally, we control for capital intensity, as prior research has suggested that incorporating CSR initiatives can be more difficult and more costly to implement in capital-intensive industries (Surroca et al., 2010). All variable operationalizations are listed in Table 1.

A common problem in meta-analysis is that the measures used in primary studies tend to involve measurement error. In our case, especially the constructs firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, and innovation capacity are often measured through self-report surveys (Boyd, Gove, & Hitt, 2005), which are often not corroborated with archival measurements (Bergh et al., 2016). Following best-practice recommendations (Bergh et al.,

2016), we deal with measurement error by applying a conservative 0.80 measurement reliability standard to all hypothesized mediator variables.

# Meta-analytic procedure

We used Hunter and Schmidt (2004) meta-analysis (HSMA) to compute the meta-analytic mean association between CSR and CFP, standard deviations, percentage of variance due to sampling error, and 95 percent confidence intervals around mean correlations (Whitener, 1990). Since our constructs of interest are usually reported as a continuum, we provide correlations rather than standardized differences (d) (O’Boyle, Pollack, & Rutherford, 2012). HSMA “allows for the correction of statistical artifact and thus provides a relatively accurate estimate of the true average strength and variance of the relationship in the population of interest” (Geyskens, Steenkamp, & Kumar, 2006, p. 526). Compared to Hedges and Olkin meta-analysis (HOMA; Hedges & Olkin, 1985), which only corrects for sampling error, HSMA corrects for a broader array of statistical artifacts, including measurement error, dichotomization, and range restrictions (Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2009), making it a more appropriate choice for estimating mean effect sizes including subjective measures (Kepes, McDaniel, Brannick, & Banks, 2013). The HSMA method involves (1) estimating the population mean correlation and variability, (2) correcting for the statistical artifacts of sampling and measurement error, and (3) evaluating the existence and impact of moderators (Judge, McNatt, & Xu, 2011). We performed sub-group analyses to assess whether c was sensitive to: (a) the source of the CSR data (survey, archival, or third-party evaluations); (b) the stakeholder group targeted by the CSR activities (employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, community, natural environment, or mixed stakeholders); (c) the CFP measures used (accounting- or market-based); and (d) industry (manufacturing, financial services, non-financial services, or mixed industries).

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

We used both Pearson product-moment correlations (r) and partial correlations (rxy.z) derived from primary studies to compute c and the corresponding confidence interval.

A partial correlation is a standardized measure of the degree of association between two variables (x and y), controlling for the influence of a vector of other factors (z). We obtained the partial correlations from primary studies by converting reported t-statistics using the relevant formulas.iv rxy.z-based HSMAs generate useful additional information because they measure the direct impact of CSR on CFP, holding other factors constant (Doucouliagos & Ulubaşoğlu, 2008). By using rxy.z, we can also compare the mean effect size of the group of primary studies using endogeneity corrections, such as instrumental variables, with that of the group of studies that does not.

When multiple measurements for the same relationship were reported, we included all of them. Monte Carlo simulations have shown that procedures using all reported measurements outperform those that represent each study by a single value in areas such as parameter significance testing and parameter estimation accuracy (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001).

To test whether this nested research design was causing distortions in our results, we conducted a Hierarchical Linear Modeling Meta-Analysis (HiLMMA; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The HiLMMA results indicate that 30 percent of the variance in the effect size distribution resides at the within-study level. After correcting for this component, the mean effect size for the CSR-CFP relationship (i.e., the intercept of the HiLMMA model) is 0.08, which is nearly identical to the uncorrected HSMA mean effect size (0.07; see Table 2). Hence, all effect sizes reported in primary studies can safely be included in our analyses.

# MASEM Procedure

We used meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM; Bergh et al., 2016; Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2011) to test our hypotheses. MASEM

combines the techniques of structural equation modeling with those of meta-analysis (Cheung & Chan, 2005). This technique allows us to analyze: (a) the direct effect of CSR on CFP, (b) the effect of CSR on firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity, and (c) the consequences of these mediating variables for CFP (Baron & Kenny, 1986). MASEM has two advantages over conventional meta-analytic techniques. First, not all specified relationships need to be included in each primary study, as each cell represents an independent accumulation of primary studies (Carney et al., 2011). Second, MASEM allows for the testing of research hypotheses that have never been tested in prior research, especially those connecting previously unlinked streams of literature (Bergh et al., 2016).

MASEM involves a two-stage procedure (Bergh et al., 2016). First, a series of separate r-based HSMA analyses are conducted to construct a meta-analytic correlation table specifying the mean correlations between all independent, mediator, dependent, and control variables. This table is based on bivariate correlations, as partial correlations usually cannot be computed between the independent and control variables included in each primary research study. To deal with sample size differences, we based our analysis on the harmonic mean sample size (N = 3,704). The harmonic mean is less sensitive to outliers than the arithmetic mean, making it more appropriate for estimating correct and conservative t-values (Geyskens et al., 2006).

In the second stage, the meta-analytic correlation matrix is treated as the observed correlation matrix and subjected to structural equation modeling routines (Cheung & Chan, 2005). The data were analyzed using the full information maximum likelihood method with the LISREL 8.80 software package. To investigate whether a direct and significant relationship between CSR and CFP exists, and whether this relationship is mediated by our hypothesized variables, we estimated six nested models. We commenced with a model examining the direct relationship between CSR and CFP while controlling for prior firm.

# RESULTS

# Descriptive results: The conceptual structure of Strategic CSR

Following Goertz’ (2006) approach to concept formation, we present in Figure 2 the three-level conceptual structure of Strategic CSR. The concept “Strategic CSR” features at the basic level, at which theoretical propositions are developed such as propositions about the causes and consequences of strategic CSR. At the secondary level, Strategic CSR is intensionally defined in terms of its causally most relevant properties, which in our case are identified by the four empirical mechanisms mediating between CSR and CFP: reputation enhancement, stakeholder reciprocation, risk mitigation, and innovation capacity. At the third, or indicator level of the conceptual structure, we extensionally define Strategic CSR in terms of observable empirical phenomena that operationalize the causally relevant properties by which Strategic CSR is defined. For each causally relevant property, we list three illustrative indicators (i.e. examples of CSR activities) that in our view are most likely to trigger this mechanism.

The reputation enhancing property of Strategic CSR, for example, captures visible and symbolically-laden CSR activities that may trigger positive attributions from existing and prospective stakeholders. Examples include affiliation with the United Nation’s Global Compact, announcing donations to charities, and voluntary CSR reporting.

# Reciprocation Property of Strategic CSR

Reciprocation property of Strategic CSR denotes CSR activities that make a substantive contribution to the betterment of the firm’s existing stakeholders. Examples are adopting minority employment policies or family friendly HR practices and signing community benefit agreements. The risk mitigation property of Strategic CSR may involve incremental improvements in practices and processes such as waste reduction and pollution prevention, as well as the adoption of employee health and safety programs. Innovation capacity, finally, captures more comprehensive and transformative CSR initiatives. Potential indicators are public-private partnerships, investments in renewable energy, and base of the pyramid projects.

# Hunter-Schmidt Meta-Analysis Results

Table 2 presents the results for our r-based (left-hand panel) and rxy.z-based (right-hand panel) HSMA analyses pertaining to the CSR-CFP relationship. In addition to the meta-analytic corrected mean effect size (c), we report the number of samples (k), the cumulative sample size (N), the sampling error variation, the sample correlation variance, the estimated variance in population correlation, the 95 percent confidence interval around the (CI c 95%), as well as the p-value based on tests. The for the focal relationship is 0.07 (k = 1,466) and the rxy.z-based mean is 0.03 (k = 1,516). These means are somewhat smaller than those reported in prior meta-analyses (Margolis et al., 2007: 0.13; Orlitzky et al., 2003: 0.18).

In part, this is due to the fact that our study relies less on self-report data than earlier work (9% vs. 35% for Orlitzky et al., 2003). This has a deflationary effect, since self-report studies usually show larger effect sizes. Yet there is also an independent time effect at play. Even when measured objectively, the effect of CSR on CFP wanes over time (is 0.14 for studies published before 1998, but only 0.03 for studies published later), suggesting that the...

widespread diffusion of CSR practices over the last two decades may undercut some of its value as a strategic differentiating factor.

survey data are higher (r-based mean = 0.13; rxy.z-based mean = 0.10). Because few effect sizes are based on archival and third-party rater data are close to the overall, those based on sub-group HSMA analyses reveal the presence of methodological artifacts: whereas the sizes are based on survey data (12.7% of the r-based effect size distribution and 7.4% of the rxy.z-based distribution), removing these effects has no material consequences. When we break down our results by individual stakeholder groups, we find a few effects that are statistically significant but none that seem materially important. Like Orlitzky and associates (2003), we find CSR to be (somewhat) more strongly linked to accounting-based measures of performance than to market-based measures in the r-based distribution (r-based mean = 0.07 vs. 0.06). But in the rxy.z-based distribution we found CSR to be more linked to market-based measures of performance than to accounting-based measures (rxy.z-based mean = 0.04 vs. 0.03). Finally, we found limited evidence for moderation by industry context, with the exception of the financial service industry in the r-based distribution (r-based mean = 0.23).

# MASEM results and hypothesis tests

Table 3 contains the meta-analytic correlation matrix. Each of the 45 cells below the diagonal reports the results of a separate HSMA analysis for each bivariate relationship. We report both the observed correlation and the 95 percent confidence interval, total number of observations (N), as well as the total number of samples (k) on which the meta-analytic mean is based. Since no primary sample included all correlations included in our model, the total number of samples far exceeds the number of samples in any single cell.

# Results

Table 4 contains the results pertaining to our Hypotheses 1 through 5. Figure 3 visually presents these same results. The model fits the data well (χ2 = 122.25; RMSR = 0.024; GFI = 0.99).

# Hypothesis 1

Hypothesis 1 is supported. CSR is positively related to firm reputation (β = 0.10, p < 0.05), and firm reputation is positively related to CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that is channeled through firm reputation is 0.005 (p < 0.05). A formal test for statistical mediation corroborates these findings (Sobel: z = 2.65, p < 0.01).

# Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis 2 receives marginal empirical support. CSR is positively related to stakeholder reciprocation (β = 0.04, p < 0.05), which in turn has a positive effect on CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05), but the Sobel test is only borderline significant (z = 1.77, p < 0.10) and the total indirect effect of CSR that flows through stakeholder reciprocation amounts to only 0.002 (p < 0.05).

# Hypothesis 3

Hypothesis 3 is supported. CSR is negatively related to firm risk (β = -0.04, p < 0.05), and firm risk is negatively related to CFP (β = -0.09, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that is channeled through firm risk is 0.004 (p < 0.05) and the Sobel test is significant (z = 2.08, p < 0.05).

# Hypothesis 4

We also found support for Hypothesis 4. CSR has a positive and significant effect on innovation capacity (β = 0.07, p < 0.05), and innovation capacity positively affects CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that flows through innovation capacity is 0.004 (p < 0.05) and the Sobel test is significant (z = 2.53, p < 0.05).

# Hypothesis 5

Hypothesis 5 is rejected, however. On the one hand, the Sobel test confirms that the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly channeled through the four hypothesized pathways (z = 4.51, p < 0.001), with the total indirect effect amounting to 0.01 (p < 0.01). On the other hand, firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity only partially mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP, as the focal effect remains significant (β = 0.06, p < 0.05) upon their inclusion. Specifically, inspection of the path coefficients for the indirect effects suggests that the four hypothesized mediators combined explain 20.0 percent.

of CSR-CFP relationship. This suggests that there may be alternative causal paths connecting CSR to CFP.

# Additional analyses

We performed several additional analyses to address a number of problems that commonly affect meta-analyses. The first of these is the ‘file drawer’ problem, or the underrepresentation of studies reporting weak effects due to publication bias. To address it, we crafted r- and rxy.z- based funnel plots of effect and sample sizes (see Figures 4a and 4b). These figures show a symmetrical pattern with nearly half of the samples to the left of the mean effect size and half to the right; thus suggesting the absence of publication bias (Duval, 2005). We also used the triangulation method to detect the possible presence of publication bias in the CSR-CFP relationship (Harrison, Banks, Pollack, O’Boyle, & Short, 2017). This method involves three complementary tests to detect potential differences between the retrieved HSMA mean effect size and a publication bias-adjusted mean effect size estimate: (a) Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill (Duval, 2005), (b) cumulative meta-analysis (CMA), and (c) moderate selection models (Harrison et al., 2017). The results of these tests suggest the absence of publication bias in our meta-analysis.

A second common problem is undetected measurement error in the underlying primary studies. We already applied a 0.80 level of reliability to all our mediating variables in the main results (see Tables 3 and 4). As an additional robustness check, we re-ran our models using the 0.80 level of reliability for all constructs (Bergh et al., 2016). The findings of this more conservative analysis are consistent with those presented in Table 4.

A third common problem in meta-analyses of literatures based on archival data is overlapping primary samples. We therefore ran a robustness check in which we deleted effect sizes stemming from similar sources (e.g. Fortune 500 firms) with comparable median.

sampling years. This resulted in the removal of 39 r-based studies and 16 rxy.z-based studies. Our results were not materially affected by the removal of these overlapping samples.

self-report studies tend to report larger effect sizes, possibly due to social desirability and self-aggrandizing biases. We therefore ran a separate MASEM analysis on effects derived from studies reporting objective data. Our results were identical to those of the original analysis.

A fourth issue hampering meta-analyses that also partially include survey data is that they tend to be based largely on cross-sectional studies lacking appropriately lagged variables, which might violate the implicit assumption of temporal sequentiality underlying path analysis. In our sample, 40 percent of all studies are in fact based on longitudinal designs. As an additional robustness check, we therefore re-ran our hypothesized model on the subset of effect sizes derived from this set of studies. The results rejected the mediation effect of firm reputation (Hypothesis 1), possibly due to statistical power attrition, but confirmed Hypothesis 2, 3 and 4.

A sixth issue, again specific to MASEM studies, is that the theorized model may not be the model that empirically fits the data best. To account for this possibility, we tested two alternatively specified models (cf. Bergh et al., 2016). In a first alternative model, we related (a) CSR to reputation enhancement and stakeholder reciprocation; (b) reputation enhancement to CFP; and (c) stakeholder reciprocation to CFP via firm risk and innovation capacity. In a second alternative model, we related (a) CSR to firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity; (b) firm reputation to firm risk and innovation capacity; and (c) stakeholder reciprocation to firm risk and innovation capacity, and (d) firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity to CFP.

We found the theorized model to show better performance on 10 out of 14 commonly used model fit indicators.

Occasionally affect the reliability and validity of meta-analytic findings. The results of all robustness tests are available in an online appendix. In sum, we conclude that our results are largely robust against a number of issues that.

# DISCUSSION

After reviewing almost half a century of empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship, we have developed hypotheses on the causally most relevant empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to positively affect CFP. We subsequently used MASEM to test these hypotheses on the accumulated empirical evidence. As such, we aim to make several contributions to the literature.

First, our study offers a new synthesis of the available evidence that includes the last two decades of CSR-CFP research. In the fifteen years since the publication of the last two meta-analyses on the relationship between CSR and CFP (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003), the field of empirical CSR research has grown significantly as evidenced by the fact that our analysis counts no less than 224 new papers. During this period, the focus has shifted from empirically assessing the CSR-CFP relationship as a whole to examining the more concrete empirical mechanisms underlying it. Given this development, an up to date assessment of the accumulated empirical evidence is timely and useful. Next to identifying and testing four key mechanisms through which CSR activities affect CFP, our meta-analysis also found that these mechanisms do not fully mediate the CSR-CFP relationship. This implies that there is still room for future research to identify empirical mechanisms causally connecting CSR with CFP that have gone unobserved to date. We return to this below.

A second contribution of our study is that we respond to calls for more conceptual clarification of CSR (Gond & Crane, 2010; Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008; Rowley & Berman, 2000). By focusing on the empirical relationship that has received most scholarly attention to date (Margolis & Walsh, 2003), we were able to distinguish and conceptually carve out Strategic CSR from CSR more generally, and provide a definition of Strategic CSR that is both intensionally and extensionally explicit (Van Oosterhout, 2005). Specifically, we define Strategic CSR as those firm activities that appear to further some social good, while at the same time benefitting the firm financially by either enhancing its reputation, increasing stakeholder reciprocation, mitigating firm-specific risk, and/or improving innovation.

With this evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR, we address an important conceptual problem that has burdened much of the CSR literature to date. By positioning a firm’s economic responsibilities as one of a larger set of social responsibilities that comprise CSR (Carroll, 1979), a central critique of the CSR concept has always been that it confounds two fundamentally conflicting views: that of positive economics and normative ethics (Gond & Crane, 2010; Jones, 1983; Swanson, 1995; Windsor, 2006). Some scholars have indeed argued that CSR is a normative concept (Matten et al., 2003) that has little positive explanatory value (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). In this study, we have conceptually developed the Strategic CSR concept that can be used for positive research in strategic management, however. This concept only bears on CSR activities that enhance CFP, making Strategic CSR a purely instrumental form of CSR. By excluding those CSR activities that may be good for society but not for the firm, we have sought to conceptually separate some of CSR’s main positive explanatory features from the normative beliefs as to what CSR ought to comprise. By disentangling the normative and positive features of CSR in this way, we hope to provide some relief to a field that has consistently confused normative and positive.

# Discussion

On what Strategic CSR is, is now completed, nor that all issues on what CSR should be taken to mean more generally have now been resolved. With respect to the former, the development of a conceptualization of Strategic CSR does not mean that it should be clear that future empirical research may still lead to further evidence-based adjustments of the Strategic CSR concept, as would be true in general for all causal approaches to explanatory concept formation. With respect to the latter, our study has conceptually clarified Strategic CSR by carving it out of the domain denoted by CSR more generally, but only at the price of leaving that domain as conceptually opaque as it was (claimed to be) before. Both observations may help to guide future research on CSR.

# Limitations and Future Research

A third contribution of this study, therefore, is that its findings and limitations offer guidance to future research. A salient finding of our study is that the four mechanisms combined explain only 20 percent of the CSR-CFP relationship. These mechanisms therefore do not fully mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP, suggesting that our conceptualization of Strategic CSR does not yet fully account for the mechanisms connecting CSR to CFP. One explanation for this may be that research to date has not yet captured the full breadth and depth of each of the four mechanisms identified. With respect to stakeholder reciprocation, for example, we found studies on employee, government, customer, and shareholder reciprocation, but hardly any studies on community reciprocation (but see: Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017), and none on supplier reciprocation. Similarly, the benefits of stakeholder reciprocation may become manifest in different guises, including retention, word of mouth, and commitment, which all require further empirical measurement.

investigation (Bosse & Coughlan, 2016). As more empirical research fleshing out these four mechanisms accumulates, however, we expect the explanatory power of each of these mechanisms to strengthen further.

research has not yet unveiled all empirical mechanisms through which CSR may contribute to CFP. There may be other mechanisms at play than the four that we identified in this study, implying that our definition of Strategic CSR may need to be expanded and adjusted. As observed above, this is consistent with a causal approach to explanatory concepts in social science, in which new empirical knowledge about a phenomenon may require adjustments or expansions in its conceptual definition (Goertz, 2006).

Using meta-analysis to investigate our research question is one of the strengths of our paper, but it also has limitations. While our conceptualization of Strategic CSR assumes that the empirical mechanisms that we document involve causal relationships, meta-analysis is not the best method for identifying causality in empirical research. Rather, meta-analysis is more suited for investigating which theoretical views about causal relationships are supported by a preponderance of the available evidence. The growing and increasingly fragmented nature of existing CSR-CFP research makes such an assessment of the literature imperative. By identifying the four causally most relevant empirical mechanisms underlying the CSR-CFP relationship, our study may therefore constitute a counter-force to further fragmentation of the field, and provide guidance to researchers seeking to address ever finer-grained research questions in order to identify causality through their research designs.

A related limitation of meta-analysis is that the effect sizes that can be included as data depend on their availability in primary studies. Because available empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship is highly diverse, we were able to incorporate many effect sizes and empirically test finer-grained models than have been meta-analytically tested to date.

we could not address any questions for which effect sizes were not or insufficiently available in primary studies. This problem is most pressing with respect to the measurement of CSR itself, which prior research has often operationalized by using overly inclusive indicators that lump together many different phenomena (Chatterji, Durand, Levine, & Touboul, 2016; Gond & Crane, 2010; Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008; Rowley & Berman, 2000). If anything, we urge researchers to use more specific measurements of Strategic CSR, derived from the empirical mechanisms that are or have been investigated (or, to say the same in other words: to adopt level 3 indicators that derive from secondary level mechanisms, as illustrated in Figure 2).

Finally, we acknowledge that our study offers conceptual clarification on the part of the CSR concept that has strategic value for the firm. As a result, our study says very little about CSR that does not benefit the firm financially. Some scholars have explicitly argued that managers should only engage in CSR if it simultaneously advances the bottom line (Jensen, 2002; Waldman & Siegel, 2008). We do not agree, however, that all CSR is or ought to be strategic. Some CSR activities may have a neutral or insignificant impact on CFP, while others may have a significant negative effect, at least in the short to medium term (Wright & Ferris, 1997). Our meta-analysis did not touch upon the non-strategic side of the CSR concept as this has mostly been a blind spot to CSR scholars.

To understand and conceptualize non-strategic CSR, empirical research is needed that explores when and why managers sometimes pursue CSR activities that are not directly financially beneficial to the firm. Do such activities only serve managerial self-interests (Jensen, 2002; Waldman & Siegel, 2008), or are managers driven by more altruistic motives (Husted & Salazar, 2006)? Moreover, under what conditions do a firm’s stakeholders, especially its shareholders, accept non-strategic forms of CSR? This will likely depend on the consequences of non-strategic CSR, not only for the firm, but also for society. The literature currently defines CSR as all.

firm activities that appear to further some social good (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), but

CSR scholarship has mostly ignored the empirical question of whether CSR actually creates

value for its intended beneficiaries or not (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). As the value of CSR

should not be evaluated on the basis of its strategic benefits for the firm alone, we hope that

the next of wave of CSR research will focus more on empirically investigating the field-

defining assumption that CSR furthers some form of social good and thereby increase our

understanding of non-strategic forms of CSR.

# NOTES

Overall, the causal approach to concept formation that we subscribe to therefore relies on a functionalist rather than essentialist understanding of concepts. In this functionalist view, concepts are understood in terms of what they do (e.g. how they explain reality) instead of what is assumed about the nature of reality that the concept refers to (e.g. what that part of reality is essentially like even if there exists no feasible way of ever truly knowing what it is like). In this view, which Goertz (2005) develops for social science concepts, our conceptual understanding of a phenomenon therefore evolves with our empirical understanding of how the phenomenon denoted by the concept interacts with other phenomena.

One might object, as an anonymous reviewer did, that ‘hardwiring’ causal knowledge on the consequences of CSR into the conceptualization of strategic CSR would frustrate these causal claims from empirically being tested. This is a legitimate concern for empirical research indeed, as has previously been explained in the literature (Mackenzie, 2003; Mackenzie, Podsakoff, & Podsakoff, 2011) and which has also been acknowledged by Goertz (2006, p. 65–67). For three reasons, however, we do not believe this concern to burden our evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR, however. First, as we have indicated in the body of the text, developing strategic concepts by inferring them from performance differentials between firms is well-established in the field of strategic management, given its field-defining objective of explaining firm competitive advantages from observed performance differentials between firms. In any academic field, however, an important part of conceptually understanding a phenomenon will result from making sense of how the phenomenon causally influences other phenomena.

Second, as the main aim of this study is to develop the concept of strategic CSR based on the body of causal knowledge and empirical evidence already available at this time, we are not overly worried about these claims being precluded from empirical testing. Not only do we provide a comprehensive meta-analytic test of all the mechanisms that we use to identify the causally most relevant properties of CSR in explaining CFP, but all causal claims involved in our conceptualization of Strategic CSR are open to later empirical scrutiny should there be substantive or methodological reasons for empirically testing these claims further.

Finally, Goertz (2006, p. 65–67) acknowledges that hardwiring causal knowledge into our theoretical conceptualization of social reality may not only increase our theoretical understanding of social reality, but may also be problematic precisely because conceptual knowledge is assumed rather than tested in any particular empirical research project. He proposes a pragmatic approach to this problem, however, by arguing that hardwiring available causal knowledge into our conceptualizations should be avoided as much as possible when conceptualizing the explandum (or dependent variable) in research. This is because in explaining a phenomenon,

one should strive to make all explanations of this phenomenon as explicit as possible, in order to be able to empirically assess and test all of them separately and against each other. These concerns are mitigated, however, when conceptualizing the explanans (or explanatory variable) in research, because in that case we would be wise to use all currently available causal knowledge in our concepts and theories in order to develop and test novel theories and predictions. Note that our evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR treats it as an explanans in explaining CFP, while we do not make any explanatory claim in this study about Strategic CSR as an explanandum. In sum, we believe our strategy to conceptualize Strategic CSR based on available knowledge of how it causally affects CFP not only increases our theoretical understanding of Strategic CSR, but also our understanding of how Strategic CSR differs from CSR more generally.

iii A complete overview of the included studies in our meta-analysis can be offered upon request.

iv The partial correlation coefficients were calculated by using the t-statistic reported in the primary studies. If the t-statistic was not reported, we approximated it using the regression coefficient and the standard errors. The formula used to calculate partial correlation is: (t2 / (t2 + df)), where t is the t-statistic and df is degrees of freedom. Note that this will always produce a positive number, so it is necessary to convert it to a negative number if the regression coefficient is negative (Greene, 2008).

v As a separate robustness check, we also ran our MASEM analyses again without the survey data-based effect sizes. All our findings are robust against this exclusion.

vi For the Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method, we used the left-of-mean (L) estimator (Kepes, Banks, McDaniel & Whetzel, 2012). We then calculated the absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size to the left of the trim and fill-adjusted observed mean effect size (Harrison et al., 2017). For the CMA, we calculated the weighted mean correlation of the 10 percent most precise (i.e., largest samples) in our meta-analysis (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009; Harrison et al., 2017). Again, we calculated the absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size, but now to the most precise 10 percent of samples (Harrison et al., 2017). For the moderate selection model, we followed the Hedges and Vevea (2005) technique, since several of our meta-analytic relationships present a k lower than 100. We identified the specific weights and probability value cut-off points for our sample based on Vevea and Woods (2005). The absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size was calculated to the moderate selection model adjusted mean effect size (Harrison et al., 2017).

absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size to: (a) the trim and fill adjusted observed mean effect size, (b) the most precise 10 percent of samples (CMA), and (c) the moderate selection model. We then calculated the average degree of change across these three publication bias tests (Harrison et al., 2017), which was equal to 0.01. We also computed Rosenthal’s Fail-Safe N values: N = 829,029 and 436,029 for the r- and rxy.z-based correlation results respectively. These numbers represent the number of missing studies averaging a z-value of zero that should be added to our sample to make the combined effect size statistically insignificant.

# Abstract

Sustainable development refers to an economic, environmental and social development that meets the needs of the present and does not prevent future generations from fulfilling their needs. In this context, businesses play an important role. However, progress towards sustainable development has been slow, indicating the need for more concrete guidance that will allow businesses to act strategically and successfully in a sustainable way. This theoretical paper connects three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management as viewed from the perspective of sustainability in order to encourage the integration of sustainability issues into corporate activities and strategies. These three dimensions are: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context. Sixteen propositions related to these dimensions have been developed to explore the contributions of corporate sustainability management to the creation of value for businesses, society and nature. This theoretical discussion contributes to existing research in that it reveals relationships between strategic management and sustainable development and provides an agenda for further empirical research.

# 1. Introduction

Sustainable development, as defined by the Brundtland commission, tackles global environmental and social challenges and aims to provide a generic framework that allows the development of solutions that address these challenges (WCED, 1987). However, in its basic normative and ethical form, the concept of sustainable development offers no clear guidance with regard to which strategies, plans or activities need to be implemented. Consequently, a plethora of related guidelines and definitions have emerged. In order for the concept to become more binding, concrete and actionable, participation is required from numerous actors at various levels of society. Contributions from individuals, organizations, regions, states and societies are all relevant in any kind of sustainability-oriented development.

The focus in this paper has been placed on the role of industrial organizations in this process, since these play important roles in the transition of societies towards sustainability (the term sustainability is used here to describe the final goal of sustainable development, that is, a state where sustainability principles have been met (Broman and Robèrt, 2015)). Approaches such as corporate environmental management, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting have all been developed to help corporations manage various aspects of sustainability. Other examples are the integration of sustainability issues into cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000), the discussion of change management processes for corporate sustainability (Benn et al., 2014), integrated management systems to support corporate sustainability (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005), differences in institutional settings that influence corporate sustainability practices in the US and in Europe (Tschopp, 2005), or frameworks based on the EFQM model (van Marrewijk and Hardjono, 2003).

However, the impacts of these approaches seem to be rather limited (Hopwood et al., 2005; Sneddon et al., 2006; Goncz et al. 2007). One reason for this is the lack of strategic orientation with respect to the introduction and implementation of sustainability-related practices and goals (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). In this paper, it is our intention to describe how the strategic relevance of sustainability management may be improved (i.e., in the sense that both business success and sustainable development may be reinforced). This line of reasoning follows the approach of Korhonen, who distinguished between two different levels of sustainability theory: that of generating favorable planning and management outcomes with respect to sustainable development, and that of concrete and practical action (Korhonen, 2004). The propositions presented in this paper relate explicitly to the first level. Hence, the main objective of this research is a) to reflect upon the link between sustainability-oriented management and the attainment of sustainable development goals, and b) to improve the strategic relevance of management approaches in the sense mentioned above. The intention is to overcome a central limitation of current corporate sustainability management and CSR, namely, the difficulties inherent in identifying and attaining goals that contribute significantly to sustainable.

development. Specific propositions are formulated related to sustainability-oriented practices and goals that can help overcome these barriers and provide support for decision makers during the strategic implementation and execution of sustainability management.

The following research questions are addressed in this paper:

1. How can a strategic perspective of corporate sustainability management be conceptualized?
2. How can strategic success of corporate sustainability management be defined?
3. How can corporations act more sustainably from a strategic point of view?

To answer the first research question, three strategy perspectives (i.e., strategy process, strategy content and strategy context) are introduced, and the relationships that can be correlated with corporate sustainability management are defined. To answer the second research question, the potential effects of corporate sustainability activities on the individual corporation, the business sector, the society and the natural environment are analyzed. To answer the third research question, the process dimension is operationalized. Key propositions are then presented to exemplify the answers to the research questions (see sections 3 and 4). In addition, an example for each key proposition is presented; however, the propositions themselves need to be verified through future research.

The paper is structured as follows: three strategic perspectives are introduced and discussed in section 2; the outcomes and impacts of corporate sustainability management with respect to business and society are described in section 3; an analysis of the process dimension of corporate sustainability management appears in section 4; and the research results are interpreted and discussed in section 5.

# 2 Strategic perspectives of corporate sustainability management

In the context of business management research and practice, Hinterhuber (2004) defines strategy as a way of using the resources and capabilities of an organization. Boddy (2005) describes strategy as a way to decide what business an organization should be in, where it wants to be and how it is going to operate. Strategic management theory distinguishes between the market-based view of strategic management (Porter, 1980), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991), the emergent strategies view (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985) and the relational view (Dyer and Singh 1998).

In general, the use of the term ‘strategic’ implies that there is an overall goal, or some specific vision concerning the nature of success. All actors and their actions contribute to a common vision, an overall goal. A plan for attaining the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

defined goals under conditions of uncertainty is named a ‘strategy’, and ‘strategic’ can, thus, be employed to describe anything that is believed to contribute to strategy implementation and goal attainment (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010).

As used in this paper, the term ‘strategic perspective’ sheds light on two important aspects of corporate sustainability management:

1. The aspect of the goals and benefits of corporate sustainability management. Usually, environmental and social goals are embodied in all approaches to sustainability management. However, the question of who specifically will benefit from sustainability management is subject to much less discussion. For example, which individual, group, organization, or system is expected to be better off after the implementation of corporate sustainability management?
2. The aspect of how to implement corporate sustainability management. This is related to the process of identifying sustainability-related goals and determining how they may be implemented in an organization. Since the notion of sustainability often lacks clarity and can be subject to many forms of interpretation, the identification of appropriate goals and their effective and efficient implementation are challenging tasks in any type of organization.

By way of providing a theoretical starting point, three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management are used here: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context (Pettigrew, 1987; De Wit and Meyer, 2004). These dimensions were first introduced into the field of sustainability science by Baumgartner and Korhonen (2010).

Strategy process, content and context are distinct, but interrelated, components of strategy. These three dimensions provide a framework to explain and interpret strategic thinking in the present paper. Developing a strategy for a company entails the definition of the content of a strategy. Specifically, the ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ of strategic activities with respect to specific external and internal factors (the context) must be determined. The starting point for this process is the ‘why’; the purpose of the whole endeavor must be ascertained. The purpose can be, for example, to develop economically efficient and ecologically sustainable products.

The three strategy dimensions may be defined as follows:

- The strategy process itself comprises the construction and development phase of a strategy.
- The conditions surrounding strategic activities are the strategy context. The context influences the possibilities and limitations of the strategy. For example, regulations, natural resource scarcities, or pressures/innovations arising from NGOs can impose limits on, or provide opportunities for, organizations and communities.
- The strategy content represents the output of the strategy process, what is termed the result of strategic activities. This covers what is offered, what is.

created, the goals that the organization/community in question should pursue, what the organization/community in question needs to do to achieve their goals and the implications of the endeavor for the organization, community and its different shareholders and stakeholders (including the implications for the global social system and the natural ecosystem).

A closer examination of corporate sustainability strategies and sustainable strategic management is also presented in this paper. Corporate sustainability strategies describe how sustainability issues are dealt with in practice. In profit-oriented organizations, these usually form a subset of the corporate competitive strategy. One essential item here is the advantage that is identified by the management board while pursuing sustainability, that is, the strategic reason stated for developing and implementing a specific corporate sustainability strategy. This strategic decision can be grounded in normative-ethical considerations or in (pure) economic rationality, or both. If it is the former, sustainable development is seen as a superior goal that is motivated by ethical issues. If it is the latter, the economic advantages that may be gained from improving sustainable behavior are stressed. The term ‘economic’ is used here in a relatively broad sense and encompasses such things as cost reductions, increased competitiveness, improved company image and reputation, all of which help ensure that corporate activities meet the legal requirements (Baumgartner, 2014). Viewed in an even broader context, this may also include the proactive influence that a company seeks with regard to their influence on public policy and regulations on sustainability.

The main reason for choosing a sustainability approach is to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of corporate activities while improving (or at least not reducing) the economic performance of the corporation. In addition, corporate sustainability can improve the sustainability performance of other actors and systems. In principle, the individual company, business community, society and nature can all benefit from more sustainable corporate behavior. Both external developments and internal strengths and weaknesses need to be considered when attempting to integrate sustainable development issues into strategic planning (Eccles et al., 2012; Engert et al., 2016). Consequently, a corporate sustainability strategy integrates social and environmental dimensions into the strategic management process and highlights the strategic position of a company with regard to sustainable development.

The integration of environmental and social issues into corporate mid-term and long-term goals demands that a careful balance be achieved between the needs of internal and external stakeholders. This is essential to maintain or improve corporate sustainability performance. As the needs of stakeholders and the environment tend to vary, both over time and according to the geographic setting, the strategic planning process must be sufficiently flexible. Basically, corporate sustainability strategies can be distinguished on the basis of whether they have

An internal focus (introverted or conservative) or an external focus (extroverted and visionary) (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Operational and normative issues also impact the integration of sustainability (Baumgartner, 2014). The normative management level comprises those values that are shared by the management board and embedded in the organizational culture. For example, the degree to which the prevailing culture welcomes or resists the notion of sustainable development is likely to have a huge impact (Baumgartner, 2009; Linnenluecke and Griffith, 2009). At the operational level, clear, short-term, departmental goals must be derived on the basis of the corporate sustainability strategy. This means that it has to be clearly communicated throughout the organization (Baumgartner, 2014). Further cultural elements that support the adoption of a sustainable strategy are an ability and willingness to accept change, a commitment to innovation and the existence of high levels of trust within the organization (Eccles et al., 2012).

# 3 Societal and business outcome of sustainable strategic management

In this section, the societal and business values of strategic sustainability management are discussed. Here, two aspects are relevant: first, the definition of sustainability-related outcomes, and second, the question of which entity is expected to benefit from this sustainability-related outcome (on this point, also see the definition of the term “strategic perspective” in section 2). Regarding the latter point, it is necessary to distinguish between the societal and business values of corporate sustainability. Creating societal value1 through corporate sustainability management requires the achievement of compatibility between the content of the strategy and the needs of society and the biosphere. This is discussed in section 3.1. Integrating the context dimension into strategy formulation enables corporate sustainability management to create business value. This is discussed in section 3.2.

# 3.1 Societal value of sustainable strategic management – the content dimension

In its most basic form, sustainable development meets the needs of the present generations such that the needs of future generations are not compromised (WCED, 1987). Once it has been agreed upon that all members of society are responsible for creating such a sustainable form of development, companies are also expected to act responsibly. All corporate activities have an influence on society and the natural environment and, therefore, may (or may not) contribute to sustainable development.

How can companies create societal value while contributing to sustainable development? To answer this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

impacts of business on societies and the natural environment. These impacts then need to be integrated into the content dimension of strategy. One must clarify how sustainable strategic management can reduce negative social and environmental impacts and contribute to improving social and environmental outcomes.

A company is a system that transforms resources (i.e., inputs) into saleable products and services as well as into unwanted by-products, waste and emissions (Hinterhuber, 2004). In order to do so, the company must deliver appropriate returns to those who provide the company with resources (see Figure 1). Management coordinates internal activities as well as its relationships with customers, shareholders, suppliers, partner companies, authorities, society and the stakeholders in general.

Sustainability issues can be divided into economic (see Table 1), environmental (see Table 2) and social issues (see Table 3), and are related to all input and output flows. With regard to management methods and instruments, companies can implement and run environmental (e.g., ISO 14001; EMAS) or social (e.g., SA 8000) management systems, integrated management systems (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005; Jørgensen et al., 2006), or use specific management instruments to address environmental or social issues (such as LCA or social LCA, sustainability balanced scorecards (Figge et al., 2002), or environmental cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000)).

Economic sustainability embraces several general aspects of an organization that need to be respected, in addition to environmental and social aspects, in order to maintain the competitiveness of the company (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Financial stability and liquidity, profitability and financial benefits that are the result of sustainability activities are primary elements making up the economic dimension (Labuschagne et al., 2005). Therefore, issues such as

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Innovation and technology management, collaboration, knowledge management, organizational processes and purchase or sustainability reporting are important economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010).

|Economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010)|Description|
|---|---|
|Innovation and Technology|Effort made in sustainability-related R&D to reduce the environmental impacts of new products and business activities. Use of BAT (Best Available Techniques) and integrated environmental technologies, concentrating on cleaner production and zero emission technologies.|
|Collaboration|Good cooperation and active collaboration with various partners (e.g., suppliers, R&D institutions, universities). Working in shared programs and networks on the development of innovative products and technologies. Exchange of information and knowledge.|
|Knowledge Management|Activities and approaches that keep knowledge related to sustainability in the organization. Methods to plan, develop, organize, maintain, transfer, apply and measure specific knowledge and improve the organizational knowledge base.|
|Processes|Clear processes and roles are defined so that business activities are efficiently conducted, and every employee knows what the organization expects from him or her (also with respect to sustainability). Adaptations of process management to achieve sustainability necessitate the systematic implementation of corporate sustainability. Integration of sustainability into daily business life.|
|Purchase|Consideration of issues related to sustainability in purchasing. Awareness and consideration of issues related to sustainability in the organization, as well as throughout the supply chain. Relationships with suppliers, with a focus also placed on sustainability.|
|Sustainability Reporting|Inclusion of issues related to sustainability in company reports, either in individual sustainability reports or integrated in corporate reports.|

These sustainability issues provide the basis for the definition of a corporate sustainability strategy (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Baumgartner, 2014). The strategies with an external focus (extroverted and visionary sustainability strategy) are likely to have a particularly strong societal impact. By achieving improvements in terms of the sustainability issues described above, both internal and external stakeholders (employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, neighbors and society itself) are likely to benefit.

An important task for management is now to identify the economic, environmental and social issues that are important to the company. This may be done by applying the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) with its five-level model sustainability principles, ABCD-planning procedure and funnel-metaphor (Broman and Robèrt, 2015). The FSSD is recommended because it provides robust, comprehensive and generic principles for sustainability, as well as a logical process for integrating these principles into strategic planning. The funnel-metaphor is included in the FSSD to indicate how a current (non-sustainable) business practice will reduce the decision-making autonomy of companies in the mid- to long-term, since they are confronted with, for example, continually increasing social pressures and resource costs. This will lead to increased financial risks, and these are likely to be lower for more sustainable companies. By using the ABCD-planning process, a company can identify its options to comply with the FSSD sustainability principles and reduce the risk of sudden costs that jeopardize opportunities and are difficult to predict, as well as stay informed about cutting edge sustainability-driven business developments (Ny et al., 2006).

Not all businesses have a positive social value, however, and whether a company delivers a positive societal value or not is based on societal perceptions about the company’s products and services, as well as its physical impact on the natural environment. There is, for instance, a considerable consensus that producing nuclear weapons does not generate positive societal values. In the case of conventional weapon systems, however, arguments concerning their relative social value are more mixed. Whether cars or coffee pods have a positive societal value is also debated.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

value is even more controversial. While both products have positive impacts on individual users, they also have clear systemic disadvantages. However, identifying the societal value of business activities from a sustainability perspective requires the application of robust sustainability principles as defined by the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015).

Below, four propositions are made, indicating how corporate sustainability management may enhance societal value.

# Proposition 1a:

Integrating environmental and social issues into the content dimension of strategic management is a prerequisite to creating societal value.

# Example 1a:

Considering environmental (such as CO2 emissions in production processes or the product portfolio) and social issues (such as working conditions throughout the supply chain) in strategic decisions to reduce negative impacts is beneficial for society and the biosphere.

The measurement of whether a company creates societal values from a sustainability perspective requires a benchmark or reference point. With regard to economic criteria, indicators such as tax payments, investment in local communities, or R&D expenditures are commonly used. With regard to environmental and social sustainability criteria, the Brundtland definition of sustainable development must be operationalized. Environmental and social problems may arise, for instance, from damage caused by emissions or poor working conditions. For example, Labuschagne et al. (2005), Krajnc and Glavic (2005) or Cunha Callado and Fensterseifer (2011) provided frameworks that could be used to measure corporate economic, environmental and social impacts. However, defining all kinds of environmental and social impacts is highly challenging, not only because different spatial conditions that change over time apply, but also because of the interdependencies between different issues and their impacts. Nevertheless, by focusing on the major factors involved, relatively robust sustainability principles can still be defined (Robèrt, 2000). Using the principles as defined in the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015) provides a solid, stable and comprehensive basis for assessing whether corporations create societal values or not. Additionally, these sustainability principles can be used as guides to define sustainability criteria (Hallstedt, 2015).

# Proposition 1b:

In order to measure the societal value of corporate sustainability management, the operationalization of sustainable development needs to be testable. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers this kind of operationalization.

11

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Example 1b: Companies that are aware of their sustainability activities

measure them by using criteria and key performance indicators linked to the FSSD principles.

The sustainability performance of a company is based on the environmental, economic and social impacts of the resources used by the company, the products and services provided and the emissions, waste and by-products generated. The overall impact of these effects on society, however, also depends on the prevailing perceptions of the external stakeholders and the prevailing socio-cultural and economic conditions. The relationship between the company’s performance and its impacts is referred to as the sustainability impact chain (see Figure 2). The existing level of welfare in a region will have an influence the acceptance level of the environmental or social impacts. For example, in times of economic crisis, the relevance of environmental protection might decline as compared to that of job opportunities.

# External stakeholders

|---|---|---|---|
|Culture|Strategy|Sustainability performance| |
|Actions| | | |

Figure 2: Sustainability impact chain (based on Laudal, 2011)

The environmental impacts on nature are not dependent on socio-cultural or economic conditions, since they are based on physical and chemical processes. However, the relevance of the extent of a given impact on nature with respect to societal and organizational decision processes depends on both the prevailing socio-cultural and economic conditions and the relevance of these impacts as perceived by the stakeholders. Within society, those negatively affected can articulate their problems themselves. Nature and the biosphere do not have this option. Therefore, they need some form of ‘translator’, or voice in society.

12

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Proposition 1c

The sustainability performance of an organization is based on corporate activities. The extent to which the related impacts on society and nature are considered relevant and tolerable is additionally influenced by socio-cultural and economic conditions.

# Example 1c

This proposition addresses the public perception of the relevance of sustainability issues and the perceptions of members of the management team. For instance, climate change is usually more often interpreted as a severe threat to society and nature than the loss of biodiversity due to corporate activities. When assessing a company’s sustainability performance, the socio-cultural and economic conditions should be taken into account. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers principles that can be used for such an assessment.

The environmental and social performance of existing structures, systems and processes can be increased without altering the existing structures. In this case, the efficiency of the system (i.e., its probability of functioning correctly) is increased; this type of performance is defined as first-order sustainability performance. In many cases, however, increasing efficiency alone might not be sufficient and existing structures and systems must be challenged to increase environmental and social performance (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002). The need for a second-order level of sustainability performance exists, which allows the systemic effects to be taken into account and integrates the idea of effectiveness (i.e., that the correct things are being done) into the analysis. Drawing a distinction between the first- and second-order sustainability performances highlights the difference between attempting to make short-term improvements in efficiency and creating a more systematic form of innovation with sustainable development in mind. Second-order sustainability performance helps both the organization and society, in general, to become more sustainable.

# Proposition 1d

While assessing the impact of business activities, one needs to take both first- and second-order levels of sustainability into account. First-order levels are related to narrow issues of efficiency, while second-order levels are broader, and more closely related to systemic effectiveness.

# Example 1d

Increasing the efficiency of existing processes and products, such as raising the fuel efficiency of gasoline-fueled cars or improving the efficiency of recycling processes are examples of first-order sustainability performance. Second-order sustainability performance involves the introduction of new technologies, products and services such as new closed-loop electronic waste management with a focus on reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing.

These four propositions describe concepts of the societal value of corporate sustainability management, which is based on the integration of robust sustainability principles into the strategy content. The distinction made between

# 3.2 The business value of sustainable strategic management – adding the context dimension

Companies that want to achieve higher levels of sustainability emphasize the potential extra value that can be created for the business by choosing this path; the impact of their choice on society and the natural environment tend to be secondary considerations. Corporate goals must be more carefully examined, before a discussion of the business value of corporate sustainability management can be made. The analysis of corporate goals is a central topic in management research (Macharzina and Wolf, 2008). From the viewpoint of sustainability, the question arises as to what extent environmental and social goals are considered by companies, and how sustainability-related goals and other corporate goals are related. The relationships between environmental and/or social goals and economic goals can be complementary, competitive, or irrelevant (Wöhe and Döring, 2008). In the case of complementary relationships, fulfilling one type of goal helps achieve other types of goals; where relationships are competitive, pursuing one type of goal can have a negative influence on the attainment of other types of goals; and where relationships are irrelevant, no mutual influences between different goals, antagonistic or otherwise, can be observed.

Companies pursue environmental and social goals for two basic reasons. First, companies may be forced to do so by the owner, members of legislation, stakeholders, or market pressures. Second, companies voluntarily pursue sustainability, either because they are ethically motivated (Wöhe and Döring, 2008) or because they expect economic benefits to be gained (Kurucz et al., 2008). In other words, the desire to integrate sustainable issues may be driven by normative considerations, ethical rationality or economic rationality. The latter can be internally derived, when sustainable actions are combined with competitive advantages, or externally derived, when a company is forced to undertake sustainable activities (Baumgartner, 2014).

To understand the business value of sustainable strategic management, the interests or utility to the company must be analyzed. Corporate sustainability management can influence the productivity and efficiency of processes, support the development of more sustainable products and services, reduce the risks associated with environmental and social impacts and improve the credentials of a company. The resulting benefits may reveal themselves in the form of an improvement in financial performance or improved competitive strength. The former may arise in the form of higher profits, reduced costs, or increases in share prices. The latter are, in turn, derived from the increased innovation capacity, enhanced public image or reputation, increased revenues, increased employee satisfaction, productivity increases, or an increase in the market share.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

For instance, Kurucz et al. (2008) differentiated among the following four benefits of corporate sustainability management:

1. reductions in costs and risks
2. improvements in competitiveness
3. improvements in reputation and legitimacy
4. creation of value by seeking win-win outcomes

Companies are part of the business sector, and sustainability orientation can also enhance the competitiveness of this business sector. However, the risk of path dependency also exists. Taking only first-order sustainability performance into account (see section 3.1) can lead to situations where the overall sustainability performance of a sector is lower as compared to situations in which second-order sustainability performance is realized. For instance, improving the efficiency of a given industry structure can increase its short-term competitiveness, but lower its opportunities to shift the whole sector to a higher sustainability level (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). As mentioned above, the benefits in a narrow sense could have a positive influence on costs or revenues.

# Proposition 2a:

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a narrow sense is based on reduced costs or increased revenues.

# Example 2a:

Energy savings can be achieved in operations or higher margins can be gained by focusing on organic food. These so-called win-win-situations can be verified by examining the ensuing reductions in costs and environmental impact (e.g., where less energy is used to heat a building).

Freeman points out the important role that stakeholders play in long-term company success (Freeman, 1984). Stakeholders may support or hinder the implementation of corporate strategies (Michelon et al., 2012). A credible CSR policy allows a company to expand its operations without incurring stakeholder resistance (i.e., on the part of neighbors, NGOs, or society, in general). It is, therefore, important that sustainability management policies are perceived as being legitimate and worthwhile.

# Proposition 2b:

When embarking on corporate sustainability, improving public and stakeholder perceptions with regard to acceptability of company activities is likely to generate economic benefits.

# Example 2b:

A policy of active stakeholder management (i.e., a policy that genuinely takes into account the expectations and wishes of stakeholders) can be used to heighten public acceptance of company activity.

Decision makers must be open and reflect critically on their actions while considering the social and environmental aspects of products, services, processes and strategies. This is particularly true where systemic effects (i.e.,

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Second-order sustainability) are taken into account. Improving corporate environmental and social performance implies a readiness to engage in new ideas about how more sustainable technologies, structures, services and products can be employed and is, therefore, a potential source for organizational innovation. Moreover, a willingness to question the value of current services, products and processes, engage in critical self-reflection and provide room for organizational learning processes are fundamental for innovative activities (Vollenbroek, 2002; Schiederig et al., 2012; Bönte and Dienes, 2013).

# Proposition 2c

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased innovation.

# Example 2c

The integration of sustainability topics into the product design process may lead to more innovative products as compared to those generated using a conventional product design process. For instance, introducing a lightweight design in industry strengthened technological competence in several sectors.

Offering sustainable products and services provides an opportunity for market differentiation and segmentation and to meet the specific demands of ‘green’ or ‘fair’ consumers. Sustainable products and services can address the needs of sustainability-oriented consumers and, therefore, help a company gain a selective advantage over its competitors. For instance, higher prices may be charged in customer segments such as LOHAS (lifestyle of health and sustainability) (Aburdene, 2007):

# Proposition 2d

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased market differentiation.

# Example 2d

Toyota’s introduction of its hybrid car “Prius” in the US is one example. In general, at the operational level, companies also need to critically analyze services and products offered, the related turnover and market developments over a certain period of time in order to better understand whether sustainability management has led to increased market performance.

One important aspect to consider when providing sustainable products and services is the minimization of negative environmental and social impacts throughout their lifecycle. This is often associated with the ‘dematerialization’ of a product or service, which can lead to product-service systems (Roy, 2000; Mont, 2002; Tukker, 2004; Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Gelbmann and Hammerl, 2014). The resulting systems tend to be characterized by the fact that the need for a ‘product’ as a service, rather than the product or service itself, is the selling point.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

for customers. In such cases, customers no longer wish to buy a product, they merely wish to pay for the use or service the ‘product’ delivers.

# Proposition 2e:

The change from classical product-selling business models to product-service systems can significantly reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of a product.

# Example 2e:

Product life cycle analyses are used to reveal the impact of a product on the environment and illustrate which respective actors are responsible for various impacts (producer, consumer, or disposer). This helps introduce changes into the business model (although potential rebound effects also need to be considered) where the economic rationale supports selling services, rather than only products.

A business model describes how a company delivers products and services to customers and how revenues are generated (Zott al., 2011, Boons and Lüdeke-Freund, 2013). In proposition 2e, the number of services sold within the product-service system, rather than the number of products sold, determines economic success. This represents a new type of business model. Another example is related to the creation of a stakeholder value as opposed to a shareholder value (i.e., an essential element of second-order sustainability performance). Such arrangements are often referred to as “sustainable” or “green” business models (Bocken et al., 2014; Rauter et al., 2015).

# Proposition 2f:

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on the development of new business models.

# Example 2f:

Looking for ways to increase corporate environmental and social performance can provide an impulse to redesign the current business model and/or develop a new business model. This is done in the textile industry when companies fully restructure their supply chains, taking sustainability issues into account (e.g., Rauter et al., 2015).

Capturing the potential business value that will be derived from corporate sustainability management is only possible when relevant opportunities are identified. To do this, the various aspects of sustainability need to be integrated into the ‘context dimension’. The business value gained in a narrow sense is based on the ability to reduce costs and increase profits. In the broader sense, benefits are based on improved competitiveness, improved innovation capacity and the introduction of new business models.

# Developing and initiating a sustainable organization – the process dimension of sustainable strategic management

While sections 3.1 and 3.2 dealt with strategy content and strategy context, this section focuses on strategy process. The strategy process concerns the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Construction and development of strategy (i.e., the ‘how’, ‘who’ and ‘when’ of strategy formation) (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). In terms of corporate sustainability management, the strategy process must ensure that sustainability issues are integrated across all relevant corporate levels and systems such that the resulting business and societal values may be adequately captured. This means that sustainability issues are integrated into the organizational culture, the strategic goal setting, learning and feedback loops and into the daily activities of the company.

Three management levels can be distinguished (Ulrich, 2001), which are also relevant for corporate sustainability management (Baumgartner, 2014): the normative, strategic and operational levels. The normative level encompasses the basic management philosophy: the values, attitudes, beliefs and judgments, which together make up the organizational culture. This culture provides the basis for managing the organization (Baumgartner and Zielowski, 2007; Baumgartner, 2009; Linnenluecke and Griffith, 2009). The normative level guides issues that are related to the question “Who are we and who do we want to be?” This leads to the following proposition that refers to the normative level:

# Proposition 3a

The organizational culture has a strong influence on the different steps necessary in the development towards a ‘sustainable organization’. The higher the level of sustainability awareness within an organization, the more ambitious the goals and strategies deployed when pursuing sustainable development.

# Example 3a

Baumgartner (2009) provides the example of a global mining company in order to illustrate the relationships between basic values, assumptions and strategic orientation.

Long-term goals and product/service-market combinations are defined at the strategic management level. From a sustainability perspective, it is important that the business and societal values of corporate sustainability management are clearly identified and developed (see section 3.1 and 3.2; again, the FSSD with its backcasting approach and sustainability principles is very helpful). This requires the identification of specific contextual factors and evaluation of the relevance of sustainability issues for the company:

# Proposition 3b

Defining short-term and long-term goals in corporate sustainability management requires the clarification of the societal and business values that will be derived.

# Example 3b

A short-term goal could be the reduction of energy consumption per employee per year. A corresponding long-term goal might be the constant reduction in energy consumption together with the exclusive use of renewable energies in energy production.

18

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Implementing a corporate sustainability strategy at the operational level requires the integration of non-economic issues of sustainability. Matters that are not normally considered to be part of the remit of standard business administration must be addressed. The need to rely on and enhance employee capabilities is a key point. Specific feedback and learning loops must be established across different management levels. Most importantly, it must be possible to transfer the experience gained at the operational level to the strategic and normative levels, or experience gained at the strategic level to the normative level (Baumgartner, 2014). Furthermore, all organizational departments need to be involved in sustainability implementation, at least to some extent. To summarize these issues, the following proposition has been developed:

# Proposition 3c

A corporate sustainability strategy matches its goals with its organizational capabilities, the organizational responsibilities of different departments and the geographical and temporal system boundaries.

# Example 3c

To define and implement a corporate sustainability strategy, it is necessary to identify the capabilities needed within the organization (e.g., the respective competencies in LCA or materials technology), and the departments involved in corporate sustainability activities (e.g., marketing, engineering, R&D). Additionally, decisions must be made in terms of time, location and operational technique.

Implementing corporate sustainability management requires change and learning processes in any organization. Usually, three different levels of organizational learning may be distinguished: adoption-learning (single-loop-learning), change-learning (double-loop-learning) and learning to learn (deuteron learning) (Argyris and Schön, 1978). From a sustainability point of view, the organizational learning processes raise a number of interesting questions, such as those that address the extent to which it is possible to communicate and understand the long-term aspects of sustainability, or those concerning the nature and extent of the uncertainty associated with long-term development and interactions among environmental, social and economic issues from local, regional and global perspectives (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2009; Probst and Büchel, 1994; Müller-Christ, 2001). According to Siebenhüner and Arnold (2007), sustainability-oriented values must be integrated into an organization before any sustainability-oriented learning processes can take place. It is essential, therefore, to gain sufficient qualifications and receive enough training support.

Change processes are doomed to failure unless the members of an organization possess the sufficient ability to learn (Bieker, 2005). The newer the strategy, structure and processes are to a company, the less compatible they are with the prevailing organizational culture, and the more intensive the organizational change and learning processes needed (Schein, 1995). This consideration led to the development of the following proposition:

19

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Proposition 3d

Corporate sustainability management should facilitate mutual learning processes to address challenges related to sustainable development. These learning processes are based on feedback loops in and among all organizational departments and management levels.

# Example 3d

Goal-oriented learning mechanisms, the integration of milestones into existing R&D processes, formalized instruments of communication, self-organized working groups, guideline-oriented learning processes and project work for learning processes all illustrate how learning may be embedded in the context of corporate sustainable development (Siebenhüner and Arnold, 2007).

The objective of operational management is to execute strategic guidelines and plans and attain the set strategic goals in the most efficient way. The corporate sustainability strategy is implemented at the operational level of management, in terms of how the vision, mission, long-term goals and strategic plans are executed within the company. The focus is placed on the various corporate functions such as on logistics and materials management, production, maintenance, marketing, public relations, human resources and communication. Innovation and continuous improvement are seen as cross-functional areas, which are integrated into other corporate functions. Specific sustainability-oriented activities must be carried out as part of each corporate function.

# Proposition 3e

Developing a sustainable organization requires the integration of issues of sustainability into the operational management level and the consideration of their relevance for all activities, routines and processes.

# Example 3e

Sustainability needs to be operationalized for all activities, processes and routines, for instance, with the implementation of ISO 14001 with regard to environmental issues. Additionally, various aspects of sustainability need to be specified and should appear in all relevant organizational and decision processes (e.g., in descriptions of functional specifications, criteria for the selection of suppliers, eco-design-principles).

While, in theory, the focus tends to be placed on so-called win-win situations, in reality, companies must deal with the conflicts and trade-offs among economic, social and environmental goals. They must often choose between generating business value and societal value in corporate sustainability management. Companies are embedded in a dynamic form of interplay that involves economic, societal and natural systems (Hjorth and Bagheri, 2006). To deal with any emerging or prevailing antagonisms and trade-offs, decision makers need to understand the nature of the economic, environmental and social benefits and how these are related to corporate activities.

20

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Proposition 3f

In order to deal with trade-offs and win-lose situations that are related to economic, environmental and other social goals, decision makers need to consider both short- and long-term effects of their decisions on the company, society and natural environment.

# Example 3f

One example is the difference between the investment cost of new production equipment, the total costs of ownership (TCO) and the environmental impact over the product life cycle. Sometimes, higher investments can lead to reduced TCO and environmental impacts. The question is whether decision makers are aware of the respective trade-offs involved and are willing to accept the long-term consequences.

This last proposition presents the final component in our discussion of the strategy process of corporate sustainability management. The FSSD provides support (see section 3.1) for overcoming trade-offs in win-lose situations and provides businesses with general assistance that enables them to gain a cutting-edge position in sustainability-driven markets, while achieving a balance between sustainability compliance and return on investment.

# 5 Discussion and Conclusions

Businesses are central actors in any societal transition towards sustainability. However, even though concepts such as CSR, environmental management and corporate sustainability management have been subjects of discussion for many years, the advances that have been achieved are still limited. In fact, to date, only limited progress towards sustainable development has been observed.

The underlying goal of this paper was to introduce strategic management into the discussion of corporate sustainability in order to clarify various aspects related to corporate sustainability management. This should enable companies to create business and societal value through their sustainability-related activities. Arguments posed in this paper not only suggest theoretical propositions, but also provide concrete examples of how these propositions could be practically applied (see Table 4).

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

of strategic management is a prerequisite to creating societal value. In order to measure the societal value of corporate sustainability management, the operationalization of sustainable development needs to be testable. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers this kind of operationalization.

# Proposition 1b

The sustainability performance of an organization is based on corporate activities. The extent to which the related impacts on society and nature are considered relevant and tolerable is additionally influenced by socio-cultural and economic conditions.

# Proposition 1c

While assessing the impact of business activities, one needs to take both first- and second-order levels of sustainability into account. First-order levels are related to narrow issues of efficiency, while second-order levels are broader, and more closely related to systemic effectiveness.

# Business value of sustainable strategic management – the context dimension

# Proposition 2a

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a narrow sense is based on reduced costs or increased revenues. When embarking on corporate sustainability, improving public and stakeholder perceptions with regard to the legitimacy and acceptability of company activities is likely to generate economic benefits.

# Proposition 2b

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased innovation.

# Proposition 2c

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased market differentiation. The change from classical product-selling business models to product-service systems can significantly reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of a product.

# Proposition 2d

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a broader sense can be based on the development of new business models.

# Developing and initiating a sustainable organization – the process dimension

The organizational culture has a strong influence on the different steps necessary in the development towards a ‘sustainable organization’. The higher the level of sustainability awareness within an organization, the more ambitious the goals and strategies deployed when pursuing sustainable development.

# Proposition 3a

Defining short-term and long-term goals in corporate sustainability management requires the clarification of the societal and business values that will be derived.

# Proposition 3b

A corporate sustainability strategy matches its goals with its organizational capabilities, the organizational responsibilities of different departments and the geographical and temporal system boundaries.

# Proposition 3c

Corporate sustainability management should facilitate mutual learning processes to address challenges related to sustainable development. These learning processes are based on feedback loops in and among all organizational departments and management levels.

22

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Developing a sustainable organization requires the integration of issues of sustainability into the operational management level and the consideration of their relevance for all activities, routines and processes.

# Proposition 3e

In order to deal with trade-offs and win-lose situations that are related to economic, environmental and other social goals, decision makers need to consider both short- and long-term effects of their decisions on the company, society and natural environment.

# Proposition 3f

The lack of strategic orientation in corporate sustainability management is one major reason for lack of progress in this field. This can be offset to some extent by clarifying the respective opportunities, benefits, risks and trade-offs associated with the implementation of corporate sustainability.

Three dimensions of strategic management – strategy content, context and process – have been introduced in order to clarify how corporate sustainability management can help create economic, environmental and social value. The various propositions presented highlight the relationships among the three strategic dimensions and the various elements of corporate sustainability management.

Propositions 1a-d show how (first- and second-order) sustainability performance may be linked to the generation of added value for society. Propositions 2a-f describe the benefits that may be derived from corporate sustainability management for a company. Finally, propositions 3a-f describe how the various aspects of sustainability may be integrated into organizational structures at the normative, strategic and operational management levels.

Figure 3 provides an overview of the relationships among the three strategy dimensions and societal and business values by making use of a sustainability impact chain.

Figure 3: Strategic perspectives integrated into a corporate sustainability impact chain

The answers to the research questions (see section 1) are discussed below.

The first research question (“How can a strategic perspective of corporate sustainability management be conceptualized?”) was addressed by introducing three dimensions of strategic management: strategy process, content and context.

The second research question (“How can strategic success of corporate sustainability management be defined?”) was addressed by distinguishing between the societal value and business value of corporate sustainability management. By making use of first- and second-order sustainability performance levels, the various elements relevant to the assessment of the success of corporate sustainability management were identified. First-order sustainability performance focuses on the maximization of economic, social and environmental efficiency, whereas second-order sustainability performance is characterized by its focus on systemic effectiveness.

The third research question (“How can corporations act more sustainably from a strategic point of view?”) was addressed in section 4 through a description of the process dimension and related propositions. Figure 3 shows how the strategic perspectives are integrated in the sustainability impact chain (as described in section 3.1). Integrating sustainability considerations into the strategy context is necessary to create business value. In the absence of the latter, companies.

would ignore the relevant sustainability issues. Matching strategy content to societal needs allows a company to create societal value.

The paper offers both scientific and practical contributions. By combining the currently somewhat distant fields of classical management and sustainability, the paper makes a scientific contribution in that it provides, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first holistic perspective on corporate sustainability management. This helps fill gaps in the ongoing discussion about connections between issues of (strategic) management and sustainability. The practical contribution consists of specific examples, which were given to support the theoretical propositions made. This provides managers with a comprehensive overview of topics that are relevant to the integration of sustainability into daily business activities. Scholars and practitioners are invited to improve, test and amend these propositions as part of further research.

# 1. Introduction

Over the past few decades, there has been a growing emphasis on technological innovation within organizations leading to increased attention in research [1,2]. Organizations have recognized the potential of technological innovations to enhance their competitive advantage. Numerous studies have demonstrated that firms can leverage technology to improve their performance and drive innovation [3,4]. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of AI in today’s market has been shown to have a significant impact on firms’ innovation strategies, as evidenced by several studies [5]. Economists and industry experts have been attempting to comprehend the effect of GAI on innovation and have urged for further investigation on the subject [6,7]. Scholars, who are focused on utilizing technology in creation, have also started to investigate this issue [8–10]. Studies on the use of GAI by customers in various sectors have primarily focused on identifying the barriers that prevent them from achieving the maximum outcome and how AI can assist them in making decisions and enhancing their operations [11,12].

Conceived as a sub-discipline within AI, GAI allows users to create new content, such as text, images, audio, and videos. It has attracted the interest of various tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Apple. OpenAI’s Codex, DALL-E, and ChatGPT are some of the tools used for this process [13]. Every year, a single overarching idea tends to define the major tech trend. For instance, in 2022, XAI and Web3 emerged as buzzwords.

Technologies 2023, 11, 44

that caught the tech world’s attention. Although these trends show no signs of slowing down, 2023 is expected to be dominated by GAI. The concept of GAI involves using algorithms to generate new content. ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing articles, poems, and computer programs, is a prominent example of this technology. Its ability to generate high-quality content is both impressive and a little scary [14]. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI—a research organization backed by Microsoft—has garnered significant attention since its unveiling in November 2022. Its debut has led some to believe that AI is becoming more mainstream. With the commercial success of ChatGPT, Google recently launched an experimental service called Bard, which demonstrates how AI could potentially revolutionize search by providing more nuanced responses to users. [15]. The same week, Microsoft also unveiled a new Bing-powered version by ChatGPT, designed to provide users with more accurate and timely search results. Instead of relying on the traditional ladder approach to search results, ChatGPT takes a request, scans for answers, and provides a response that includes citations to the sources.

Despite the increasing importance of the role of GAI in innovation studies, there has been little effort to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing its applications in various sectors. Moreover, the lack of a clear framework for assessing the impact of GAI on the innovation management process has hindered the development of effective strategies [16, 17]. To tackle these issues, a comprehensive theoretical review of the literature on GAI was conducted. The aim of the review is to provide a basis for developing new theoretical models to study GAI in different sectors [18]. Understanding the diverse needs of customers is essential for creating value that resonates with them. This is because their subjective evaluation of wants and needs can significantly influence the design and implementation of strategies to meet those needs. In addition to identifying customers’ requirements, research emphasizes the importance of customer involvement in co-creating value [19]. Value co-creation refers to the process of involving various stakeholder groups in the creation of a product or service [20]. To enable this process, organizations must leverage appropriate technologies. This can lead to a better customer experience. Information and communications technology (ICT) has become integral to all aspects of life, allowing businesses to enhance their customer experience. By using GAI, companies can further improve their customer experience and provide personalized services [21]. Due to the increasing number of people using social media platforms, the demand for interactive technology has become more prevalent in every industry. It has led to the emergence of GAI as a leading technology flag bearer.

This paper takes a multi-disciplinary approach to explore the potential impact of GAI on customers’ experience across various sectors. It reviews the volume and trends of operative outputs related to GAI applications and identifies factors that influence the adoption of GAI by firms. The paper also proposes a conceptual business model for implementing GAI to achieve goals. However, the study is limited by a lack of comprehensiveness and a narrow scope, making it challenging for scholars to identify relevant gaps in understanding the topic.

To broaden the field’s scope, the research agenda aims to develop new research tools and methods that can enhance the understanding of the various factors influencing the decision-making process and the adoption of GAI. The paper’s main findings suggest that the framework for GAI applications should be interpretive, interactive, and immersive (3I), providing a deeper understanding of the technology’s drivers and outcomes. As GAI applications continue to impact our daily lives, developing a particular framework for sustainable behavior in the future is feasible.

The paper is organized into several sections. It begins with an exploration of GAI, followed by a discussion of its impact on consumers and content creation, as well as the advantages it offers manufacturers. Best Practices for using GAI in the Customer Experience Journey are presented. The paper also includes a discussion of GAI’s potential for businesses, and its future applications. Next, the practical and industrial implications

Technologies 2023, 11, 44

of GAI are examined, as well as a policy framework to address its limitations. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the findings.

# 2. Exploration of GAI

GAI is used to create new content such as videos, audio, and text. Recent breakthroughs in this field have the potential to significantly change how we create content. One example of a chatbot that uses GAI is ChatGPT, which can answer questions on the spot. The OpenAI chatbot (ChatGPT), released to the public in November 2022, is regarded as the best. It already had over a million users in just five days [22]. Its creators also posted impressive examples of its output, such as poems and computer code. While the impact of GAI on content creation is still uncertain, some experts in fields such as advertising and education are keeping a close eye on developments in this area.

While there are concerns about the impact of GAI and machine learning on various industries, there is also significant potential for these technologies to have a positive impact. In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated potential in a variety of fields, including medical imaging. Aside from the technology, multiple questions must be answered to develop GAI models [23]. For instance, how does it fit into the broader machine learning framework?

Although ChatGPT has received a lot of attention recently, it is not the first text-based AI model to generate interest. Google’s BERT and OpenAI’s GPT-3 have been released to some fanfare in the past couple of years. Despite their impressive capabilities, AI chatbots were not always well reviewed [24]. Google’s chatbots have been criticized in some cases for their limited abilities and inability to provide satisfactory responses to user queries. However, recent advancements in GAI have shown promise, and chatbots such as ChatGPT demonstrate the potential for these technologies to continue to evolve and improve. It will be important to continue to explore new ways to apply AI chatbots in a way that maximizes their benefits and minimizes their limitations.

In the past, human-trained models could classify text according to labels suggested by researchers. This type of training is referred to as supervised learning and involves a human overseeing and instructing the model. Text-based models, on the other hand, are currently being trained using a self-supervised learning approach. This method feeds a model a large amount of text, which helps it generate predictions. For instance, models can predict how a sentence will conclude. These models can become very accurate with the correct sample text, such as a broad swath of online text.

In 2023, GAI was showcased in an epochal manner. AI disrupted the world in 2022 as multiple startups such as DALL-E, MidJourney, and StableDiffusion appeared. Then, in just five days, ChatGPT became one of the most used platforms on the internet, with over a million users. In response to ChatGPT, Google on 7 February 2023 introduced Bard [25]. Google’s newly launched web app, Bard, is expected to be integrated with the company’s other products, including Google Maps and Gmail. The emergence of large language models such as Bard and ChatGPT highlights the evolution of AI from being innocuous to invasive. However, they also pave the way for more productive and creative applications of AI. GAI, for instance, has already begun to shape our entertainment preferences. Streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix use this technology to suggest content based on our past viewing habits [26].

# 5. Best Practices with GAI and Customer Experience Journey

The emergence of GAI capabilities has compelled businesses to reconsider their approach to engaging with customers and building lasting relationships. To achieve this, companies must begin by developing a strategy that involves an active presence in the GAI ecosystem. With GAI, businesses can transform the way they interact with their customers, seamlessly engaging with them across physical and virtual environments. In B2C interactions, customers should be empowered to create their own experiences by leveraging technology, enabling them to promote brands in a more immersive and engaging manner.

The customer journey consists of several distinct phases, beginning before using GAI, then during use, and post-use. Consumers can consume and distribute content simultaneously through the multiple media and information resources produced during the

journey [30, 32]. Today, many consumers spend a considerable amount of time researching and communicating before making a purchasing decision. During this process, they can access various interfaces and tools that enable them to manage their options and make informed choices. GAI eliminates the need for manual data analysis and can provide diverse solutions to meet customers’ needs, making it valuable in use cases that involve environments. Due to the emergence of new technologies such as smart devices and networks, it is now possible for customers to share their experiences in real time [32]. Personal decisions are often influenced by the stimuli encountered while using a product or service, and these experiences can be shared with others through social media or blogs.

GAI technology seamlessly enables businesses to interact with their customers in physical and virtual environments. It allows them to operate in hybrid mode, making it easier to switch between the two [33]. It also bridges the physical and digital worlds, allowing them to implement various experiences seamlessly. Figure 2 shows how consumers can interact with GAI before, during, and after using it. It means that different aspects of the customer experience can be performed using this technology. Because of this, consumers are more likely to develop an immersive relationship with their brands.

# Figure 2. Customer experience and co-creation process with GAI. Source: authors’ conception.

The increasing importance of customer-to-customer (C2C) interactions is becoming more critical as businesses look to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations. With the help of GAI, they can create and share rich and interactive experiences designed to make their interactions more effortless [34]. GAI enables interactions to share information and experiences, allowing businesses to deliver a more seamless customer experience. In real time, consumers can also engage and influence each other. Collaborations with other organizations can provide customers with a complete and unified experience. After interacting with ChatGPT and Bard, consumers can freely share their experiences on GAI, influencing both physical and virtual environments. Figure 3 represents the theoretical model of integration for B2C and C2C.

# 6. Discussion of GAI and Business

GAI tools are utilized in various functions in the banking industry, such as fraud detection and data privacy. In the education sector, these tools can be used to create personalized learning programs that cater to students’ different learning styles [32, 34]. In the fashion industry, GAI is used to design models of different clothing types. Furthermore, the healthcare industry can use GAI to enhance the efficiency of medical imaging and drug discovery. Although the ethical issues surrounding AI have been widely discussed in the past few years, the discussion about GAI is relatively new. The emergence of ChatGPT by OpenAI has quickly made it famous. The language model can create high-quality content across various topics. Here are the most common ethical concerns that people have about GAI:

- One of the ethical concerns is that GAI tools can create and distribute fake videos or images that are humiliating or negative. Machine learning techniques can create deep fakes, artificial images, and audio that are not real. Such content can be challenging to distinguish from real-world media, raising ethical issues [35]. Deep fakes can also spread misinformation, and they can also harass and defame individuals.
- The accuracy and truthfulness of information are both threatened by machine learning. For instance, large language models such as ChatGPT do not keep up with the changes in the world around them [36]. Despite the increasing number of persuasive and eloquent language models, they can still be used to create false and misleading information. For instance, they can make up conspiracy theories that could cause significant harm. Before implementing GAI tools, the individuals and organizations that use them must check the truthfulness of the information they produce.
- One ethical issue concerning GAI is the copyright of the creations generated by the technology [37] that determines how and what works can be used. Although machine learning models can be trained using generated data, it is unclear how they should be used in compliance with the fair use doctrine.
- Large language models are commonly used to create human-like text and speech, increasing biases [38]. However, they can also be biased by their training data because the systems are more likely to absorb social preferences.
- Misuse in education and common sectors: Using GAI in schools could create misleading or factually incorrect information. It could result in students being misled or...

# 7. Limitless Future of GAI

Despite the moral arguments about the potential of GAI, it has a bright future. The increasing number of reused IT infrastructure facilities is helping fuel the market’s growth. This will allow more developers to create exciting new platforms and programs and encourage faster technology adoption. The rapid emergence and evolution of machine learning has created a unique competitive advantage for many companies. This technology can help them improve customer support and workflows and develop new research materials. In the future, there will be a shift in how content is generated and presented, with AI-generated text, program code, and stock images becoming more prevalent. Although GAI is still in its infancy, its use is already creating various ethical problems. This will make it harder to distinguish between misleading and unethical content. This technology will eventually have to be appropriately managed to avoid affecting the public. Despite its challenges, it is still expected to continue developing and revolutionizing how people use the internet.

AI developers commonly use GAI to create texts, images, and videos. However, it is also helpful in various practical applications. For instance, one of the most popular projects in this field is Grammarly, which helps people improve their English writing. Due to AI’s potential to improve people’s quality of life, investors are starting to support the development of GAI in the biotech industry. According to Gartner, by 2025, 50% of all drug discovery will be carried out using AI. The medical technology and pharmaceutical sectors are expected to benefit from this technology. According to experts, GAI could also revolutionize the marketing industry by 2025 [32, 39]. AI is expected to generate around 30% of all outbound marketing messages, benefiting the marketing industry. Beyond this, GAI plays a crucial role in advancing human communication by enabling computers to understand and converse in natural language instead of programming languages. This technology is helping to make our interactions with machines more natural. Models powered by GAI can simultaneously process various types of images and texts, making them more versatile [34, 37]. The generalization of the human–machine interaction process and the availability of experts to train models are two of the factors that contribute to the quality of generative models. This technology is expected to play a significant role in the evolution of AI, making generative models more complex and capable of performing various tasks instead of being fun.

A study was conducted on 20 recently published technical blogs on Twitter from December 2022 to January 2023, along with a few related information science academic publications on these topics, to come up with a word cloud which provided a base for the study. Figure 5 represents the word cloud for the study.

# 8. Practical Implications

Robots will eventually devalue the administrative and clerical skills of people. They can perform tasks such as generating advertising copy and human resources letters. Automobile experts have predicted that up to 70% of the work people do in front of a computer could be automated in the next few years. According to technical experts, many now trust chatbots as writing assistants. Although it is not a job killer, outsourcing this work could help motivate human employees to focus on more productive tasks [36,38]. The ChatGPT language model can process various types of natural language. It can potentially replace humans in specific tasks, such as those that are simple to complete. ChatGPT can help programmers identify common errors in their code. It can also be used to create an email to facilitate a meeting. ChatGPT could have “massive implications” for various tasks.

# 9. Industrial Implications

The rise of ChatGPT is redefining what a machine can learn. The new models created and launched are designed to help organizations improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Many executives believe that the process is like that of the Industrial Revolution. Over the years, executives have warned that AI could replace people’s repetitive and mundane tasks [34, 38]. According to one executive, machines could replace manual tasks, such as performing maintenance on microscopes and images. However, another executive expressed skepticism about the vision of robots freeing people up to do more productive work, calling it too far-fetched.

According to a retail expert, the rise of machine learning and robotic process automation is helping organizations improve their efficiency and effectiveness. He noted that GAI allows them to get the answers they need much faster. However, many AI skeptics are still concerned about the potential impact of technology on people. They noted that it could lead to the development of false information and the loss of jobs [12, 38]. Some of the issues they are worried about include the noise in the data, which could lead to costly errors, and the threat of bias. One of the most common copyright issues that could arise is the ownership of intellectual property (IP). One industry tech officer stated that the complexity of this issue makes it one of the most challenging factors to address.

AI aims to get the bots to the point where they can become human-like. Some mental health apps are currently testing ChatGPT, which has been designed to provide users with answers to their questions [39]. However, there are still many issues that companies must address to protect their users’ privacy and safety. When adopting AI, one of the most critical factors that corporate boards should consider is establishing a strategy to address the ethical issues associated with the technology, as this could attract attention from ESG investors.

The launch of OpenAI’s latest GPT was motivated by the increasing number of countries looking to use AI. China is one of these countries that sees the potential of GAI to challenge the US. In recent years, the government has been restricted from accessing advanced chips. The logistics industry feels that it is irresponsible for companies not to use AI to reduce the environmental impact of their operations.

# 10. Policy Framework to Overcome Limitations of GAI

Despite the inception of GAI models, their full potential and impact are yet to be seen, which leaves uncertainties surrounding their use. While proponents of GAI models claim that they can produce compelling outputs, the models can also be biased due to being built on societal and internet biases, which could enable criminal activity or unethical behavior [34]. For instance, ChatGPT does not provide instructions on how to hot-wire a car, but it will comply if you tell it to do so to save a baby. Organizations using GAI models must consider the potential risks of publishing biased or copyrighted content.

Despite the risks, GAI models can still be used safely. One of the most critical steps organizations should take is to ensure that the data they use for training their models are unbiased. They should also consider using specialized models. Organizations with more

resources can customize their GAI tools to fit their requirements and minimize biases while ensuring that a human checks the outputs before they are published or used. The rapid emergence and evolution of GAI models has highlighted the immense potential of this technology. However, the landscape is still very unpredictable. In the coming years, new models will be introduced and tested regularly. The regulatory environment will also change as this technology becomes more widely used [36, 40]. As organizations start experimenting with GAI models, they should monitor the changes in the regulatory environment.

To effectively utilize GAI, executives should first identify the parts of their organization that could be affected by the technology and establish a mechanism to monitor its progress. Prior to the implementation of GAI, executives must identify the areas of their organization that it could potentially affect. For example, should we wait for the technology to evolve or develop new business models, or invest in pilots? Furthermore, should the approach vary across different areas of the organization? A good starting point would be to establish a cross-functional team consisting of data scientists, legal experts, and functional business leaders.

To establish an effective ecosystem, it is important to develop partnerships and platforms. Before implementing GAI, executives must identify the areas of their organization that could be impacted by it. As existing models have limitations, the company should have a clear strategy for identifying use cases and ensuring that the models comply with community and legal standards [37]. Encouraging thoughtful innovation is also crucial for organizations, and this can be achieved by creating sandboxed environments and implementing regulations to prevent unauthorized use.

For creators and developers, responsible AI practices and principles should be followed. Some leading platforms, such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have committed to this matter [41]. In response to the increasing number of complaints about the quality of its search results, Google has updated its guidelines for search raters. These new guidelines are designed to help them evaluate the company’s search ranking systems for providing relevant and helpful information. Some of the world’s leading platforms, such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have dedicated significant resources to developing responsible models. They should prioritize developing agile and iterative processes to ensure their platforms have the tools and resources to respond efficiently to events [26, 28]. For instance, OpenAI has a robust approach to addressing the issue of harmful prompts by implementing a crowdsourcing method for ChatGPT. They should also reinforce the use of generative AI by educating people about its capabilities [42]. Although these tools are helpful, they are not perfect. Commercial and individual users should also have access to more information about how these models work.

If users are interested in learning more about how GAI can be used to create content, it is important to apply a critical lens to its development. Since it can produce content alongside human-generated content, it is crucial to avoid taking any content at face value [43]. When using GAI to create content, it is crucial to apply a critical lens and verify the accuracy of the information. To maintain integrity in one’s work, tools to identify and add citations to AI-generated content should be considered. Additionally, it is important to recognize that generative models do not consider the concept of confidence when responding to questions, so additional research may be necessary to verify the accuracy of the data generated by these models [44, 45].

Although GAI tools have the potential to be used ethically, it is important to be aware of their potential shortcomings and conduct due diligence on the frameworks used to develop them. Consideration should be given to intellectual property rights when developing products using GAI [46, 47]. Some models “reproduce” the content they draw from, which can lead to a situation where a license for a particular piece of code is mistakenly “generated” as a new solution. Because of this, copyright protection is an important issue. Moreover, ownership and rights may be affected due to the data used in developing these systems [48, 49]. Even though third-party developers use GAI, you might

# 11. Conclusions

Despite the impressive results of GAI, it is still not yet clear that this technology is ready for prime time. Many ethical and practical issues still need to be resolved before it can be considered a viable technology. It is important to note that reinforcement learning systems designed to detect and correct biases can still make mistakes. For instance, ChatGPT, a chatbot, sometimes produces completely inaccurate information after responding to a user’s query. It lacks a built-in mechanism to challenge or warn the user if this results in an error. In addition, filters are still not yet effective at catching inappropriate content. For instance, an image-generating app that lets users create avatars from photos could still display inappropriate content even though they had the appropriate images. One of the challenges companies face when integrating GAI technology into their operations is the lack of consistency across different company values and norms. Addressing this issue requires a long-term approach that involves significant investments in computing power and technical expertise. Due to the nature of GAI models, intellectual property issues are still being debated. These AI tools can predict the next content that will be used in each sentence or design or image. These tools do not have a database of facts to draw on. Instead, they can make plausible-sounding claims. According to GPT-3 of OpenAI, the company’s AI tools can make false claims due to how plausible sentences are not always true. Here, we tried to offer a framework that is interpretive, interactive, and immersive in all applications. The success of GAI applications depends on their ability to engage their users in a more productive manner. This can be achieved through the development of interactive features that allow them to share knowledge and ideas.

# Abstract

Financial market information can provide an objective assessment of losses anticipated from temperature changes. In an APT model in which temperature shocks are a systematic risk factor, the risk premium is significantly negative, loadings for most assets are negative, and asset portfolios in more vulnerable industries have stronger negative loadings on a temperature shock factor. Weighted average increases in the cost of equity capital attributed to uncertainty about temperature changes are 0.22 percent, implying a present value loss of 7.92 percent of wealth. These costs represent a new channel that may contribute to cost of climate change assessment.

# 1. Introduction

We examine to what extent temperature shocks affect the cost of equity. If temperature fluctuations are uncertain and systematically affect cash flows, temperature shocks could represent a priced Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) risk factor, resulting in increases in expected returns. Higher expected returns mean a higher cost of capital to firms, which can have a profound and adverse impact on economic growth (Henry, 2003). To study empirically whether temperature shocks are a priced APT factor, we follow the empirical asset-pricing literature (e.g. Vassalou, 2003; Kapadia, 2011). We find that the average cost of equity capital is 0.22.

1 Our investigation is motivated by substantial uncertainty in temperature variation, which can be illustrated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s widely quoted estimates for the increase in the global mean temperature. IPCC’s range for the possible increase of global mean surface temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) relative to the 1986–2005 period is vast: from 0.3°C to 4.8°C (IPCC, 2014). Kamstra, Kramer and Levi (2003) examine how temperature affects human mood and investor behavior, but not from the climate change perspective. Fankhauser and Tol (2005) study the impact of climate change on capital accumulation, but not from the cost-of-capital perspective. Brunner (2002) analyzes the effects of the El Niño weather cycle on commodity prices and economic activity but does not consider the cost of capital. Previous finance literature has examined the interaction between weather and financial markets. For instance, Roll (1984) and Fleming et al. (2006) study how weather-related information affects, respectively, mean returns and return variances in particular weather-sensitive markets, and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) consider how weather impinges on returns by affecting trader attitudes. These studies focus on higher-frequency (daily) weather events and subsequent return realizations. Our paper focuses on a very different aspect of the interaction between weather and financial markets: the impact of lower-frequency (monthly) weather events, relating to changing perceptions of the distribution of future temperatures, on systematic risk and the economy-wide cost of capital.

percentage points higher on an annual basis due to temperature shocks. Based on Henry’s (2003) finding of an approximate one-to-one relationship between the cost of capital and GDP per capita growth our results imply that temperature shocks cause a 0.22 percentage point reduction in the growth rate of U.S. GDP per capita. This estimate is statistically and economically significant.

A rapidly growing new climate-economy literature has drawn on exogenous temperature shocks to identify causal effects of high temperatures on production at both micro and macro levels, thereby uncovering widespread cash flow effects of temperature shocks. For instance, Fisher, Hanemann, Roberts, and Schlenker (2012) find a negative impact of high temperatures on U.S. agriculture. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) show that temperature increases at the higher end of the distribution reduce labor productivity in sectors with high exposure to weather such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; transportation and utilities; and manufacturing. Cachon, Gallino, and Olivares (2012) find that high temperatures reduce productivity and automobile production at the plant level. There is also experimental evidence that high temperatures affect labor productivity (Seppänen, Fisk, and Lei, 2006). Dell, Jones and Olken (2012) in a world sample find that temperature increases reduce not only levels but also growth rates of real GDP, particularly in developing countries. We contribute to the new climate-economy literature by investigating if temperature shocks also have discount-rate effects.

Our results have important implications for climate change research. The extant climate change literature relies on a “damage function” to incorporate the effects of climate change on economic outcomes. The typical specification allows temperature variation to affect the level but

To put the number in perspective, the aggregate economic costs of mitigating secular increases in temperature (designed to limit climate change to below 2°C by the end of the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels) only amount to an annualized reduction of per capita consumption growth of 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points (IPCC, 2014). Earlier studies also document a negative cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income per capita (e.g., Nordhaus, 2006; Dell, Jones and Olken, 2009). See Dell, Jones and Olken (2014) for an excellent review of the new climate-economy literature.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

not the growth rate of output (Dell, Jones and Olken, 2014), which is inconsistent with the empirical evidence in the new climate-economy literature. Dell, Jones and Olken (2014) accordingly call for research to help understand the mechanisms underlying the temperature-growth relationship. The evidence in this paper identifies a specific mechanism through which temperature shocks impact growth. Temperature shocks have not only cash-flow but also discount-rate effects, and a large literature pioneered by Bagehot (1873) and Schumpeter (1911) shows theoretically and empirically that the cost of capital affects capital accumulation as well as innovation and productivity (e.g., King and Levine, 1993).

In a contemporaneous paper, Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) develop a long-run risks model focusing on temperature-induced disasters, and find that temperature shocks have a negative impact on asset prices. There are two major differences between Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and the present paper. First, the underlying temperature-economy linkages are different. While temperature-induced disasters drive the negative impact of temperature variation in Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015), the impact in the present paper is the result of high temperatures emphasized by the new climate-economy literature. For instance, high temperatures without disasters could still reduce labor productivity and supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014), which may help explain the negative effects of temperature shocks in earlier years when temperature-induced disasters were insignificant. Second and more importantly, the perspectives differ. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) do not disentangle the cash-flow and discount-rate effects. Given that cash-flow effects of temperature variation are well documented in the new climate-economy literature, we focus here on identifying the discount-rate effect of temperature shocks.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 states three testable hypotheses and briefly discusses the data. Section 3 presents the tracking portfolio approach of

constructing the temperature shock factor. Section 4 provides estimates of the loadings and the premium on the temperature shock factor. Section 5 investigates specifically the quantitative impact of temperature shocks on the cost of equity capital. Section 6 discusses further empirical results, and Section 7 concludes with a discussion of implications and a brief summary.

# 2. Hypotheses and data

Temperature shocks essentially act as a systematic negative productivity shock in the context of Balvers and Huang (2007). Since temperature shocks negatively affect most firms (i.e. the factor loadings on the temperature shock factor are generally negative), the risk premium must be negative to ensure that riskier assets have higher average returns.

# HYPOTHESIS 1.

The temperature shock factor has a significant and negative risk premium.

Temperature shocks may have an uneven impact. In particular, some sectors are more vulnerable: Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; transportation; and manufacturing, because these sectors have high exposure to climate (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014). Furthermore, Quiggin and Horowitz (2003) emphasize adjustment costs to temperature changes. They argue that costs of adjustment arise if capital stocks: (i) are dependent on climate for their optimal location; and (ii) depreciate more slowly than is required to permit easy adjustment to a changing climate. Thus, firms with capital in place, value firms, should be more vulnerable. Along this line, small firms should be more sensitive to temperature shocks, because they may lack resources to adjust. If temperature shocks are truly a risk factor, the industries or firms that are more sensitive to temperature shocks should have higher loadings (in absolute value) on the temperature factor and, accordingly, higher required returns and costs of capital.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# HYPOTHESIS 2

Industries or firms that are more vulnerable to temperature shocks have higher loadings (in absolute value) on the temperature shock factor. If suspicions of climate change have intensified in recent decades, the aggregate importance of temperature shocks ought to have risen. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) substantiate that negative elasticity of asset prices to temperature fluctuations has been increasing over time, which motivates us to test the following hypothesis.

# HYPOTHESIS 3

The impact of the temperature shock factor on the average cost of equity capital increases over time. Dictated by data availability, our sample period starts in April 1953 and ends in May 2015. In terms of location, we limit ourselves to the United States, because the required temperature and financial-market data are available for the U.S. and are uniformly accurate. The portfolio returns and Fama-French factor data are from Kenneth French’s website. The macro variables data are from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The temperature is the U.S. average temperature series obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. In addition, we merge CRSP and Compustat to construct a variety of equity portfolios for empirical testing.

To infer the news concerning future temperature variation contained in current stock returns, we employ the economic tracking portfolio approach proposed by Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989) and Lamont (2001) and previously applied by Vassalou (2003) and Kapadia (2011). This statistical approach allows us to estimate the risk premium of temperature shocks without imposing a particular model of asset pricing.

# 3.1. Primary specification

Our simple time-series model is essentially the daily temperature model of Campbell and Diebold (2005) amended to deal with monthly observations and to avoid seasonal adjustment:

Tt+12 = c + at + εt+12,

where Tt+12 is the average temperature from month t+1 to t+12, t is the deterministic time trend, and εt+12 captures effects of all other variables (emissions, climate policy, etc.). Tautologically, we can separate Tt+12 into a previously expected component, a news component, and noise:

Tt+12 = E-1(Tt+12) + ∆Et(Tt+12) + εt

where the news component is ∆Et(Tt+12) = E(Tt+12) - E-t(Tt+12), which is contained in the temperature observation in month t, and the noise component is εt+12 = Tt+12 - Et(Tt+12).

If temperature variation matters for asset pricing, innovations in excess returns of basis assets should reflect innovations in expectations about future temperature variation. That is,

∆Et(Tt+12) = b[Rt - E-1(Rt)] + εt,

where Rt - E-1(Rt) represents a column vector of unexpected excess returns, with Rt a column vector of excess returns of the basis assets in month t (i.e., returns net of the risk-free rate), and εt the component of news that is orthogonal to the unexpected excess returns of the basis assets.

Assume that the basis asset excess returns in month t are a linear function of Z1, a vector of conditioning economic variables known at t-1, and that Tt+12 is a linear function of...

See also Harvey (1989), Seater (1993), and Visser and Molenaar (1995). Our approach is agnostic about the extent to which unanticipated temperature shocks signal changes in climate. In the Web Appendix we show that five-year average temperature shocks in the U.S. are highly persistent in the period 1950-2014 with a coefficient of 0.70 (whereas this coefficient is 0.17 in the period from 1895-1950). This persistence may merely be indicative of temporary warming/cooling trends rather than permanent changes in climate. The importance of temperature shocks, however, definitely extends beyond the current period. Our approach isolates the changes in value of firms resulting from the temperature shocks, thus providing a discounted sum of the market-perceived impacts over time irrespective of whether these reflect transitory trends or permanent climate change.

Following the tracking portfolio literature, we focus on news concerning next year’s temperature variation. In our primary specification we follow Vassalou (2003) and use the six Fama-French size and book-to-market (BM) portfolios as the basis assets. To obtain the economic conditioning variables – the ZE1 in equation (4) – we again follow Vassalou (2003) and use macro variables known to predict equity returns. They are the risk-free rate (RF), the term premium (TERM) (the 10-year government bonds rate from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank minus the risk-free rate), and the default premium (DEF) (the yield difference between BAA and AAA bonds from the St. Louis Fed). We use the lagged average temperature over the past year (i.e., from t−12 to t−1) as the single climate control variable in ZC1.

The primary specification in Table 1 presents the construction and diagnostic tests of the tracking portfolios for the temperature shock factor based on equation (4) with the six Fama-French size-value portfolios as the basis assets and the macro variables used by Vassalou (2003) as conditioning variables. Because we use overlapping data, the t-ratios are obtained from Newey-West HAC standard errors with the bandwidth (lag parameter) set equal to 24.7.

All results are for 1953:5 - 2014:5 (we lose 1953:4 because we employ a one-month lagged term premium and our term premium data start in 1953:4. We also lose the 2014:6-2015:5 period which is required for the final sample point of T+12). The coefficient estimates in Panel A indicate that SL (small growth firms) and SH (small value firms) have significant tracking ability, positive and negative, respectively, for future temperature changes. The signs and significance of these coefficients are as expected: Growth firms may potentially benefit from temperature variation as they do not yet have their capital in place (SL coefficient > 0). Value firms face adjustment costs, as implied by Quiggin and Horowitz (2003), since their capital is already in place.

7 The bandwidth exceeds the data overlap interval as suggested by Sun, Phillips, and Jin (2008). Following Bekaert and Hoerova (2014) we set the bandwidth equal to Max[3, 2*horizon] which is 24 in the case with annual horizon.

# Alternative Specification 2

We avoid the specifics of the temperature trend model of Campbell and Diebold (2005) by assuming instead a stochastic trend model of temperature with unknown drift term to identify the tracking portfolio. Estimate the following model over the entire sample:

TGRTH+12 = c + eZE1 + gZC1 + bRt + tt−12 (4b)

where TGRTH+12 = 100 × log(Tt+1,t+12/Tt-11,t) is the log difference in the average annual temperature. The variables are the same as in the benchmark specification: Rt = (SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, BH)′; ZE1 = (RF−1, DEF−1, TERM−1); ZC1 is the lagged growth rate in the average temperature; and the temperature shock factor is the tracking portfolio return TSF = bRt.

# Alternative Specification 3

We avoid the tracking portfolio approach altogether in favor of a standard two-pass approach with specific risk corrections based on the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor model, using unexpected temperature changes as the temperature shock factor. Estimate the following model in a rolling fashion (for each month s we estimate for the months s-120 to s-1) to avoid using future information; generate an error term es using the 10 years of data preceding month s so that for each month only the residual for the last month of the following regression is utilized to serve as the unexpected temperature change:

Tmt = C + A⋅t + Σi=110 Siseasonali + LTm + et−i (4c)

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

where Ttm represents the monthly temperature, t is the deterministic time trend, seasonali is the seasonal dummy variable for month i. The lag length is selected by the Schwartz-Bayes Criterion.

Then we calculate the expected temperature based on the estimated parameters. The temperature shock factor is the unexpected change in the monthly temperature, TSF* = ett (the asterisk indicates that the temperature shock factor is not a tradable asset in this case).

The specifics of the tracking portfolios generated by the first and second robustness approaches (ALT1 and ALT2) are in Table 1 (the third approach does not use a tracking portfolio). Panel B in this table illustrates that the mean tracking portfolio return continues to be robustly significantly negative for the alternative set of basis assets and the different trend specification for temperatures.

# 4. Standard Asset Pricing Models: Structural Approaches

The tracking portfolio approach of Lamont (2001) in Section 3 estimates the risk premium of the temperature shock factor without specifying an equilibrium asset-pricing model. In this section, we supplement these results by estimating the risk premium of temperature shocks within the standard multi-factor models. This approach enables us to obtain the sensitivities to the temperature shock factor of particular industries/firms, to address Hypothesis 2, and to identify the aggregate quantitative impact on the cost of equity capital and how this impact changes over time, to address Hypothesis 3.

and the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM. These are the most common systematic risk models. For our asset-pricing specifications, we take the Fama-French (1996) three-factor model temperature shock factor is added to these specifications as an additional factor. If temperature shock impacts are adverse, we expect to find negative loadings for typical firms or portfolios and a negative risk premium to compensate for the additional risk. The impact of temperature shocks.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

On the average cost of capital can naturally be measured by the product of the premium and the average loading of assets on the temperature shock factor.

We use the Black-Jensen-Scholes (1972) / Fama-MacBeth (1973) two-pass methodology – estimating factor sensitivities in the first pass, and using these to obtain risk premia in the second pass – with standard refinements: the Shanken (1992) correction to obtain errors-in-variables-robust standard errors, accounting for the fact that factor sensitivities are estimated, and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) correction to generate misspecification-robust standard errors.

Lewellen, Nagel and Shanken (2010) argue that using as test assets only size–BM portfolios, as is common in the empirical asset-pricing literature, can be highly misleading due to the strong factor structure of these portfolios. They propose to expand the set of test assets to include other portfolios, such as industry portfolios. Including industry portfolios is particularly attractive for our research since the climate-economy literature has predictions for how different industries should be affected. We thus use 55 size-value and industry portfolios (25 size-value portfolios plus 30 industry portfolios) as our test assets, instead of just 25 size-value portfolios.

Since temperature variation is a systematic risk, we expect to see that the temperature shock factor is priced and that its premium is negative. The results based on the primary specification for constructing the temperature shock factor are reported in Table 2. The first-pass results for each of the four models: CAPM, the Fama-French model (FF), the CAPM plus the temperature shock factor (CAPM+TSF), and the Fama-French model plus the temperature shock factor (FF+TSF) are similar. In each case, the GRS test rejects the model. The second-pass results reveal that the risk premium for the temperature shock factor is significantly negative as predicted. The model has a higher average cross-sectional R-square when the temperature shock factor is included in the Fama-MacBeth regressions. The premium estimates of -0.01 percent.

(Chems), Textiles (Txtls), Steel Works (Steel), Fabricated Products and Machinery (FabPr),
Automobiles (Autos), Aircraft, Ships, and Railroad Equipment (Carry), and Business Supplies
and Shipping Containers (Paper) have significantly negative sensitivity, because they have high
exposure to climate as Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) suggest; Food Products (Food), Coal
(Coal), Utilities (Util), and four Manufacturing industries [Beer & Liquor (Beer), Tobacco
Products (Smoke), Consumer Goods (Hshld), and Electrical Equipment (ElcEq)] also have
negative sensitivity to the temperature shock factor, although not significant.

Recreation (Games), Wholesale (Whlsl), Retail (Rtail), and Tourism (Meals) are
significantly negatively affected by temperature shocks, possibly because temperature shocks
affect time allocation (for instance, Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) find that temperature
increases reduce time allocated to outdoor leisure); Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Trading
(Fin) has a negative loading on the temperature shock factor, which may reflect the negative
impacts of temperature shocks on the real economy.

The loadings on the temperature shock factor are positive for only five industries, with
three of these significant: Health (Hlth), Services (Servs), and Business Equipment (BusEq). The
health industry has a small demand elasticity, and therefore may provide a good hedge against
negative supply shocks. Services have few long-lived capital assets. Business Equipment may
benefit from adjustment due to temperature fluctuations as this increases demand for its product.

To test Hypothesis 2 formally with the industry portfolios, we create two equal-weighted
portfolios. “High” includes the high-exposure sectors identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell
(2014) (specifically: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; construction; mining; and
transportation and utilities; and manufacturing), while “Low” consists of the remaining sectors.
The loadings on the temperature shock factor for “High” and “Low” capture the average sensitivities of the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

high-exposure and low-exposure sectors, respectively. Consequently, the loading on the temperature shock factor for “High – Low” picks up the sensitivity difference between the high- and low-exposure sectors. The time-series regressions for “High”, “Low” and “High – Low” are reported at the bottom of Panel A. The average loading on the temperature shock factor for the high-exposure sectors is -6.18 (t = -4.65), while that for the low-exposure sectors is -1.37 (t = -1.68). The sensitivity difference is -4.81 with a HAC-robust (Newey-West with 12 lags) t-statistic of -3.40. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is significantly supported for the 30 industry portfolios.

# Size and value portfolios

For the size- and value-sorted portfolios the conjectures are that: (1) value firms, which tend to have long-lived capital assets, are more sensitive to the temperature shock factor than growth firms, and (2) smaller firms, which may have less resources to adapt or to adjust, are more sensitive to the temperature shock factor than larger firms. The results for the 25 size- and BM-sorted portfolios in Panel B of Table 4 are consistent with these conjectures. For instance, the temperature shock sensitivities of the small-value portfolio and the small-growth portfolio are, respectively, -27.15 and -6.73, suggesting that value firms are more sensitive to temperature shocks; similarly, the temperature shock loadings of the small-value portfolios and the large-value portfolio are, respectively, -27.15 and -12.77, implying that small firms are more vulnerable to temperature shocks.

A more direct test, instead of obtaining loadings from the mimicking portfolio for temperature shocks – our primary specification of TSF from equation (4) – obtains loadings straight from the temperature shocks – alternative specification 3 (TSF* from equation 4c). As shown in the Web Appendix, the loadings of the sectors identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) a priori as having the highest exposure to weather, have (equal-weighted) average loading of -4.52 to the temperature shocks measured based on equation (4c) whereas the remaining sectors have only slightly negative loading on these temperature shocks of -0.17. The difference is -4.35, which is marginally insignificant (bootstrapping p-value of 0.11 in a one-tailed test). The support for Hypothesis 2 is weaker here due to higher standard errors. This occurs because the raw temperature shocks contain less focused information about economically relevant future weather implications than is captured by the mimicking temperature factor portfolios. The weaker results illustrate the advantage of using tracking portfolios rather than raw temperature shocks.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# 5.2. Impact on the cost of equity

To test Hypothesis 2 formally for the size and BM portfolios, we again form equal-weighted portfolios to capture the average sensitivities of different types of stocks. “Small” consists of the five small-capitalization portfolios, and “Big” includes the five large-capitalization portfolios; “Value” contains the five value portfolios, and “Growth” comprises the five growth portfolios. “Small - Big” picks up the difference between small and big stocks, and “Value - Growth” does the same for value and growth stocks. The time-series regressions for the returns of these portfolios are reported at the bottom of Panel B. The average loading on the temperature factor for small stocks is -16.89 (t = -10.38), while for large stocks it is -2.80 (t = -3.17). The sensitivity difference between small and big stocks is -14.09 with a HAC-robust t-statistic of -6.51. The average loading on the temperature factor for value stocks is -21.40 (t = -29.29), while that for growth stocks is 1.64 (t = 1.40). The sensitivity difference between value and growth stocks is -23.04 with a HAC-robust t-statistic of -18.06. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is also strongly supported for the 25 size and BM portfolios.

The economy-wide average impact on the cost of equity capital is obtained by multiplying the temperature shock risk premium by the weighted average loading. We use the market value weights and loadings of the 55 industry- and size-value sorted portfolios. The weight is obtained by dividing the market value of each portfolio by the sum of the market values of the 55 portfolios. The loadings on the alternative versions of TSF are obtained as in Table 4 from the time-series regressions of portfolio returns on the appropriate factors for each model. The weighted averages of the loadings are multiplied by the risk premium (γ from Table 2 for the primary specification CAPM+TSF model, and Table 3 for the alternative TSF specifications) to find the average impact measure. Note that the step of multiplying the risk...

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

premium by the loadings is necessary because there is nothing in our approach that requires loadings to sum to one (as for market returns) or to zero (as for some factor mimicking portfolios).11

Panel A of Table 5 shows the total value-weighted impact. Using the CAPM plus TSF risk model the impact (the risk premium times the average temperature shock loading) is economically significant and has the same order of magnitude for each of the alternative TSF specifications. Numerically, the weighted average annual increase in the cost of equity capital from temperature shocks is 0.22 percent in the Primary specification, 0.23 percent for ALT1, 0.26 percent for ALT2, and 0.18 percent for ALT3.

To discover if Hypothesis 3 can be confirmed, we repeat the above exercise with rolling samples to find whether the impact of temperature shocks has increased from an early part of the test period to a later part. The risk premium at each time is estimated with 30 years of data to obtain meaningful estimates. As our earliest observation for the term premium is 1953 the test period starts in 1983. We update estimates monthly by dropping the earliest observation and adding the latest observation. Panel B of Table 5 shows the average impact based on the rolling estimates over two evenly divided sub-periods: 1983-1998 and 1999-2014. To properly evaluate the significance of the impact difference in the two subsample periods we use the approach of Cooper, Gutierrez, and Hameed (2004) which provides appropriate standard errors.

In the primary specification the average temperature shock impact in period 1983-1998 is a significantly positive 0.11 percent. The impact in the more recent period 1999-2014 is also significantly positive, but three times as large at 0.33 percent. The difference is clearly

11 The value-weighted average loadings present a proper market average (for the US stock market). Whereas, roughly, each firm is represented twice (once in the industries and once in the value-size sorted portfolios) the computation requires the value weights of the 55 portfolios to sum to one so that each firm’s market value is accurately reflected.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

significantly positive. The results for the three alternative specifications are qualitatively identical, also showing a significant impact in both periods with a substantially larger impact in the second period.

The significant difference for the two intervals nominally confirms Hypothesis 3. To obtain more information about the path of the temperature shock impact over time, we present the specific time paths of the impact in Figure 2. These are quite consistent for the various specifications. A closer look at the time path of the impacts over time illustrates that the issues are not as simple as hypothesized. The evidence further confirms that temperature variation matters for asset pricing and that its impact is significantly positive and, until recently, has been growing over time as is consistent with Hypotheses 1 and 3. However, the impact estimate appears to decrease after 2004, which is not consistent with Hypothesis 3.

There are plausible explanations for the unexpected decrease in the impact estimate after 2004 that are consistent with the perspective of climate change risk. In particular:

1. The risk premium on the temperature shock factor may have declined because of reduced temperature risk. Indeed, as Panel E of Figure 2 shows, the standard deviation of temperature (30-year moving average of U.S. annual temperatures) displays a similar pattern as the time series of impact estimates in Panels A-D, and has started to decline after 2004.
2. The ability of firms to handle temperature fluctuations has improved as trading in weather derivatives has taken off dramatically since the turn of the century and adaptation may have been substantial in recent years.
3. It is naturally also possible that the time series after 2004 is too short to pick up a reliable trend, in contrast to our simple sample split, which did support Hypothesis 3 over the full data period.

# 6. Further discussion and robustness checks

# 6.1. Industry portfolios as basis assets

In this paper, we follow Vassalou (2003) and use the six Fama-French size and book-to-market (BM) portfolios as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio. However, as Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) imply, because size and BM portfolios have a strong factor structure, a factor with spurious correlation with the size and book-to-market factors could seem to carry a significant risk premium in standard asset-pricing tests. Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) suggest taking into account industry portfolios. In our case, previous studies (e.g., Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014) also suggest that particular sectors (e.g., construction, transportation, and manufacturing) are more vulnerable to temperature shocks. However, we should not expect climate sensitivity to be homogenous within an industry, because as we have pointed out size and value also matter. For instance, although temperature shocks affect labor supply and productivity, a large manufacturing firm (or a firm with less capital in place), relative to a small firm (or a firm with more capital in place), may be better able to mitigate the effects of temperature shocks by, for instance, installing more effective/advanced cooling systems. Thus, it may be more informative to use industry-size-value sorted portfolios, instead of just industry portfolios, to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio.

To avoid employing too many basis assets we adopt the Fama-French five-industry classification.12 For each of the five industries we use only the small-firm portfolios (small firms are more sensitive to climate changes) and distinguish between low-value and high-value firms (firms with fewer assets in place adjust more easily than those with more assets in place). In all

The industries are Cnsmr (Consumer Durables, NonDurables, Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services -- Laundries, Repair Shops), Manuf (Manufacturing, Energy, and Utilities), HiTec (Business Equipment, Telephone and Television Transmission), Hlth (Healthcare, Medical Equipment, and Drugs), and Other (Other, Mines, Constr, BldMt, Trans, Hotels, Bus Serv, Entertainment, Finance).

We parsimoniously employ 10 industry-size-value portfolios (SL and SH in each industry) as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio, and report the results in Panel A of Table 6. Multicollinearity among even this diverse and relatively small group of 10 basis assets makes it difficult to interpret individual coefficients. However, the chi-square test cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficients on the basis assets are jointly zero, indicating that the basis assets jointly have significant tracking ability. Furthermore, the mean return of the tracking portfolio is -0.03 with a t-statistic of -4.27, which is close to that based on the primary specification (i.e., using six size and BM portfolios as basis assets).

We repeat the time-series as well as cross-sectional tests with the newly constructed temperature shock tracking portfolio (TSF10), and report the results in Panels B and C of Table 6. The time-series tests show that not only do many of the test assets have significant exposure to the temperature shock factor, but also their exposure is consistent with the predictions of the climate-economy literature. For instance, value (high-BM) portfolios are negatively affected by temperature shocks. The cross-sectional test reveals that the temperature shock factor carries a significantly negative premium even in the presence of the market factor.

# 6.2. Bootstrapping simulation

In evaluating the significance of the risk premia in Panel C of Table 6 we consider errors-in-variables robust (Shanken, 1992) and misspecification-robust (Shanken and Zhou, 2007) standard errors.14 Jiang, Kan, and Zhan (2015) demonstrate that, even with these corrections, ignoring estimation error in factor mimicking portfolio weights can lead to an underestimation of...

As shown in the Web Appendix, employing only the five industry portfolios as the basis assets provides no significant tracking ability. In addition, we find considerable within-industry heterogeneity along the size and value dimensions. Nevertheless, holding size and BM constant, industry sensitivities differ substantially, indicating that temperature shocks are not merely relevant as spuriously related to size and BM.

The GMM-based standard errors employed in, among others, Vassalou (2003) and Aretz, Bartram, and Pope (2010) also adjust for errors in variables.

The standard errors of the estimated risk premia corresponding to these portfolios. To gauge if our results are robust to the estimation errors of the (factor mimicking) tracking portfolio, we carry out bootstrapping simulations for all instances involving tracking portfolios.

We randomly permute the time index for the market index returns (MKT) and the Temperature observations jointly. Then we run the tracking portfolio regression to create the TSF from equation (4). Subsequently, we find the loadings on MKT and TSF, and then the risk premia from the second pass cross-sectional regression on the mean returns of the 55 portfolios. We repeat this for 1000 random permutations of the time index for MKT and Temperature to generate the distribution of the estimated risk premia under the null hypothesis that the risk premia are zero. Panel C in Table 6 indicates that, with the 10 industry-size-value portfolios as basis assets, only 32 of the thousand simulations generate a TSF risk premium smaller than the obtained risk premium of -0.02. Thus, the one-sided p-value is 0.03 for the TSF risk premium (compared to p = 0.02 for the errors-in-variables and misspecification-robust approaches).

A similar bootstrapping procedure for the significance of the risk premia for the primary specification is conducted for Table 2 and for the alternative specifications in Table 3. The risk premia remain significant for the primary specification in Table 2 (p = 0.04 for the CAPM+TSF and p = 0.02 for the CAPM+FF). Results for the alternative TSF specifications in Table 3 are similar as those implied by the regular t-statistics except for Alt1 for which the results are no longer significant at the 5 percent level, with p = 0.06.

# 6.3. Tracking portfolio regressions with alternative horizons

Since it is not clear a priori how far ahead financial markets can forecast temperatures, we run a number of tracking portfolio regressions in which we use the: contemporaneous temperature, one-quarter-ahead, two-quarter-ahead, three-quarter-ahead, and four-quarter-ahead.

average temperature as the dependent variable. To remove the seasonality in monthly temperatures, we follow Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and use temperature anomalies, defined relative to the 1951-1980 monthly averages. The results for both the six size-value and the 10 industry-size-value portfolios as basis assets are presented in Panels A and B of Table 7, respectively. First, the contemporaneous temperature does not significantly affect basis asset returns, as the chi-square test cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficients on the basis asset returns are jointly zero. Second, the financial markets can forecast future temperatures, and the adjusted R² increases with the forecasting horizon. The adjusted R² rises from 17% for the one-quarter horizon to 38% (six basis assets case) or 40% (10 basis assets case) for the one-year horizon. This result echoes Roll (1984) who shows that financial markets may be more reliable indicators of future events influencing cash flows than the pronouncements of specialized forecasters: orange juice futures prices have forecasting power for weather conditions (involving frost) beyond the forecasts of the National Weather Service. The evidence thus justifies our tracking portfolio specification.

# 6.4. Global temperatures

Should global temperatures affect U.S. asset returns? Provisionally, the answer is No, invoking the recent climate-economy literature which emphasizes “local” effects of temperature. (For instance, Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014, find that temperatures affect labor supply within a county. That is, a high temperature in a county reduces the labor supply in that county, because “high temperatures cause discomfort, fatigue, and even cognitive impairment”, p. 1). Global temperatures, accordingly, may not impact U.S. asset returns. To test this conjecture, we obtain the global temperature anomalies data from the National Climatic Data Center. The “anomalies” are defined as the temperature minus the average temperature over the 1951-1980 period.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

seasonally adjusted. Figure 3 plots the global and U.S. temperature anomalies. The general trends are similar, but there is considerable difference between U.S. and global temperatures. For instance, the lead article in The Economist of November 28-December 4 2015 notes that the global temperature was the highest in 2014 since NASA temperature recording began in 1880, but the U.S. temperature was not particularly high in that year.

If the global temperature affects U.S. financial markets, U.S. asset returns should reflect innovations in expectations about future global temperature variation. That is, our (U.S.-based) basis assets should have significant ability to track future global temperature fluctuations. We report the corresponding tracking portfolio regressions in Panel A of Table 8. For robustness, we explore both sets of basis assets. From the chi-square test we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero at the 5% level, regardless of which set of basis assets we use, indicating that the (U.S.-specific) basis assets do not track global temperatures.

# 6.5. SMB, HML, and the temperature shock factor

As small-big and value-growth stocks are differently affected by temperature shocks, it is possible that SMB and HML capture some of the information in the temperature shock factor. We explore this perspective by separately regressing SMB and HML on the temperature shock factor. The results are reported in Panel B of Table 8 for both sets of basis assets. As expected, SMB and HML capture some information in the temperature shock factor, since there are significant correlations between the temperature shock factor and SMB/HML. Thus, a part of the well-known explanatory power of the size factor (SMB) and the value factor (HML) for cross-sections of returns may arise from differing sensitivities of assets to the temperature factor.

# 6.6. Temperature variability and exposure to temperature shocks

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

If temperature shocks really matter in terms of their local effects (on, for instance, labor supply and productivity), we should expect that firms in areas with more temperature variation are more negatively affected by temperature shocks. To capture local temperature variation, we retrieve state-level temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center, and rank the U.S. states according to the standard deviation of the state-level temperature from 1953 to 2015. We define the 10 states with the highest standard deviation of temperatures as high-temperature-variation states (H), and the 10 states with the lowest standard deviation of temperatures as low-temperature-variation states (L). Since firms often have their production facilities close by their headquarters (Coval and Moskowitz, 1999), we identify the location of a firm by its headquarter location, and form size-value as well as industry portfolios within states. We then run time-series regressions to examine if firms in high-temperature-variation states are more negatively affected by the temperature shock factor relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in low-temperature-variation states.

The results are reported in Table 9. The “Industry portfolios” section presents the results for the five industry portfolios. In three of five industries, the loadings on the temperature shock factor are significantly more negative for firms in the high-temperature-variation states. For instance, for manufacturing firms, while the loading on the temperature shock factor is -5.14 (t = -2.68) for firms in the high-temperature-variation states, it is -0.00 (t = -0.00) for firms in the low-temperature-variation states. The results for Other are inconsistent with our expectation, which may be partially due to our identification strategy. For instance, Other includes Trans.

Although coastal areas are typically vulnerable to climate change (Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe, 2014), many effects are not directly related to local temperatures. For instance, rising sea levels may be more due to global temperatures instead of local temperatures. The 10 high temperature-variation states in our sample are: Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; The 10 low temperature-variation states are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

(transportation). Although a transportation company’s headquarter may be located in a low-temperature-variation state, it may provide its services in high-temperature variation states too, making our results difficult to interpret. The results for the size-value portfolios are shown in the “Size-value portfolios” section, and suggest that temperature shocks in general have more negative impact on firms in high-temperature-variation states.

# 6.7. Uncertainty about regulation

One potential explanation for the sensitivity of particular industries to the temperature shock factor is that the indicator has little intrinsic economic importance for temperature fluctuations but that markets fear the political pressures arising from common perceptions of a climate change threat that may lead to untoward regulation hurting business profits. This “untoward regulation” line of reasoning implies that those industries which are most vulnerable to regulation designed to reduce man-made climate change would be the most sensitive to the temperature change factor. A prospective regulatory impact generally entails rationing or taxation of carbon-dioxide emissions. Hence the prediction is that industries that are the most sensitive to the temperature change factor are those industries that have the highest share of carbon dioxide emissions.

Schipper (2006) provides data on carbon-dioxide emissions in U.S. manufacturing. Manufacturing accounts for around 84 percent of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions. The Petroleum, Chemicals, and Primary Metals industries have the highest carbon-dioxide emissions, together generating more than half of these emissions. However, it is apparent from Table 4 that Oil (Petroleum and Natural Gas), Chems (Chemicals), and Mines (Precious Metals, Non-Metallic, and Industrial Metal Mining) do not have particularly large negative sensitivities to the temperature shock factor. Furthermore, many of the industries in Table 4 with strong negative

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Exposures to the temperature shock factor are non-manufacturing industries such as Finance, Retail, and Meals, with obviously low carbon-dioxide emissions. These observations do not support the “untoward regulation” explanation.

We also carry out a more formal test. If concerns about regulation drive temperature sensitivity, firms headquartered in states run by Democrats should be more exposed to temperature shocks than firms headquartered in states run by Republicans, given the different climate policies advocated by the two parties. We thus form size-value as well as industry portfolios within Republican and Democrat states, and run time-series regressions to examine if firms in Republican states are less negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in Democrat states.

The results are in Table 10. The “Industry portfolios” section shows that in all five industries, the loadings on the temperature shock factor are not significantly less negative for firms in the Republican states. E.g., for manufacturing firms the loading on the factor is -3.66 (t = -1.75) for firms in Republican states but -2.95 (t = -2.43) for firms in Democrat states. The results for the size-value portfolios are in the “Size-value portfolios” section and suggest that temperature shocks in general do not have less negative impact on stock returns of firms in Republican states.

# 7. Summary and Implications

How do US equity markets react to news contained in US temperature changes? Tracking portfolios formed from basis assets distinguished by value, size, and/or industry have significant value in filtering the economic importance of persistent temperature changes inferred from temperature shocks. We hypothesize that (i) a significant risk premium exists on a temperature tracking portfolio, (ii) its impact on the cost of equity capital, at least until recently, has been.

26

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

increasing over time, and (iii) loadings at the industry level on this tracking portfolio are generally negative and more so for industries considered to be more sensitive to climate change.

On the whole we are able to confirm the hypotheses and infer, taking the average risk premium, that the cross-sectional average cost of equity capital is 0.22 percentage points higher on an annual basis as a result of uncertainty related to future temperatures.

The severity of impact and even the existence of climate change are heavily debated, and it is difficult to obtain an objective perspective. For this purpose, financial markets may be helpful in uncovering true perceptions as they aggregate the beliefs of market participants who do not merely offer opinions but have “skin in the game.” So, what does the result we find from the U.S. equity market data, that the uncertainty about temperature changes contributes an annual average of 0.22 percentage points to costs of capital, say about costs of climate change?

A convenient means of capitalizing the one-period impact to account for the long run present value costs of temperature shocks is to use the Gordon growth model approximation arising when we equate asset prices with the expected net present value of future dividends, and proxy the associated variables by setting the dynamic paths of dividends, dividend growth, and costs of capital equal to their averages. Aggregate stock market values can then be expressed as P=D/(R−G), in which P is the current stock market price index, D the end-of-period expected dividends (considered a constant proportion of GDP), G the average anticipated growth rate of dividends, and R the average cost of equity capital. We are then able to draw the following conclusions by placing our results in the context of the existing literature:

1. Henry (2003) finds an approximate one-to-one relationship between the cost of capital and GDP growth. This is consistent with the Gordon growth perspective in which the impact of a change in the cost of capital is equivalent to the impact of an opposite change in the

27

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

growth rate of dividends or output: %∆P/∆R=−%∆P/∆G. Accordingly, the stock market wealth impact of the 0.22 percent increase in the cost of equity capital (based on the full-sample primary specification) is equivalent to that of a 0.22 percent reduction in the growth rate of dividends or GDP. Our explanation for the reduction in the GDP growth rate answers Dell, Jones and Olken’s (2014) call for mechanisms explaining the empirical temperature-growth linkage. It also provides a perspective, showing that the impact of temperature fluctuations on the cost of equity capital alone is of higher magnitude than the total policy cost of mitigation, an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage (IPCC, 2014), which allows room to contemplate more aggressive climate-change mitigation policies.

(2) The Gordon growth approximation also implies that %∆P=−(P/D∆R. If we set) P/D (the price-dividend ratio) equal to 36, which is its average value over our sample period from March 1953 to December 2014 (see Robert Shiller’s website) then the present value of the cost of temperature shocks is 36 x 0.22% = 7.92%. To put our estimate of a 7.92 percent loss due to climate change in the perspective of previous estimates, consider that: the literature has considered mainly the specific present value costs of permanent losses in GDP due to abrupt climate change in future years, and, more recently, the costs of losses in GDP related to extreme weather resulting from climate changes. The estimated cost of climate change based on these mechanisms varies from around 0.2% to 1.0% (Stern, 2007) to 2.0% to 3.5% per 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature (Choinière and Horowitz, 2006) and a maximum of 3.75% (Heal and Kriström, 2002). However, the uncertainty about temperature fluctuations adds substantially to the overall costs and shows up in the higher cost of equity capital which previous studies have ignored in this context. Our result amounts to adding an additional present value cost of climate change of larger magnitude to previously identified costs.

The impact is estimated for the entire sample using 30 years of preceding data for each estimate. Accordingly, the first period starts in 1983:4. We update the estimates each month by dropping the earliest observation and adding the latest observation. The mimicking factor (TSF) portfolio weights and the loadings on the mimicking factors are estimated using the 30 years of data preceding the data point. The value-weighted loadings are then multiplied by the TSF realization for the data point to obtain the impact estimate for that month.

The tracking portfolio regression results are in Panel A. All results are for the 1953:5 - 2014:5 period using overlapping data. While the dependent variable for PRIMARY and ALT1 is Tt+12 (the average annual temperature from t+1 to t+12), that for ALT2 is TGRTHt+12 (the temperature growth rate). SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, t, BH, LCMLG, and LGMRF are excess returns: the Fama-French size-value portfolios net of the one-month T-Bill rate, the corporate bond rate minus the long-term government bond rate, and the long-term government bond rate minus the T-Bill rate; RFt-1, DEFt-1-, and TERMt-1 represent, respectively, the lagged one-month T-Bill rate, the lagged default risk premium, and the lagged term premium. Panel B presents for each specification the average return on the zero-investment portfolio with the weights given by the coefficient estimates in Panel A. To adjust for the autocorrelation in errors resulting from the overlapping temperature shock data, Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation corrected standard errors are obtained employing a bandwidth of 24 months.

# Table 2. Summary statistics of time-series and cross-sectional regressions for 55 size-value and industry portfolios under the primary specification

Panel A summarizes time-series regressions to explain monthly excess returns on 55 size-value and industry portfolios. Panel A provides the average absolute value of the intercepts (|Alpha|), the average adjusted R² (AVG R²), and the GRS F-test statistic (GRS). Panel B reports the Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass OLS regressions with 55 size-value and industry portfolios as the test assets. γ is the estimated risk premium associated with each factor. tEIV and tMIS are the Shanken (1992) errors-in-variables robust t-ratio and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) misspecification robust t-ratio, respectively. We also report the OLS cross-sectional adjusted R². The models are:

- CAPM: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)
- FF: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + sSMB_{ti} + hHML_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)
- CAPM+TSF: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + fTSF_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)
- FF+TSF: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + sSMB_{ti} + hHML_{ti} + fTSF_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)

where \( r_{it} \) is the excess return on asset i in period t, and MKT is the excess market return, SMB is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of small stocks and big stocks, HML is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of high book-to-market (value) stocks and low book-to-market (growth) stocks, and TSF is the tracking portfolio returns of changes in expectations about temperature changes from equation (4).

# Table 4. Factor loadings of 55 size-value and Industry Portfolios

The factor loadings of the portfolios are inferred from:

rit = αi + mMKTt + fiTSFt + it

where rit is the excess return on asset i in period t, MKT, TSF are the excess returns on the market and the temperature shock factor. The β’s are the associated factor loadings, and it is the disturbance. To save space, we do not report the associated HAC-robust (Newey-West with 12 lags) t-statistics for 55 size-value and industry portfolios. The significant factor loadings at the 5% level of significance are in bold.

To formally test Hypothesis 2 with the industry portfolios, we create two equal-weighted portfolios. “High” includes the high-exposure industries identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) (specifically: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; construction; mining; and transportation and utilities; and manufacturing), while “Low” consists of the remaining industries. The loadings on the temperature shock factor for “High” and “Low” capture the average sensitivities of the high-exposure and low-exposure industries, respectively. Consequently, the loading on the temperature shock factor for “High – Low” picks up the sensitivity difference between the high- and low-exposure industries. For the temperature factor we use the primary temperature factor TSF obtained from equation (4).

To test Hypothesis 2 formally for the size-value portfolios, in Panel B we also form equal-weighted portfolios to and use the primary temperature factor TSF obtained from equation (4). “Small” consists of the five small-capitalization portfolios, and “Big” includes the five large-capitalization portfolios; “Value” contains the five value portfolios, and “Growth” comprises the five growth portfolios. “Small – Big” picks up the difference between small and big stocks, and “Value – Growth” does the same for value and growth stocks.

# Table 5. Value-weighted Annual Impact (%) Estimates

The economy-wide average impact on the cost of equity capital is obtained by multiplying the temperature shock factor risk premium (from Table 3) by the weighted average loading on this factor. We use the market value weights and loadings of the 55 industry and size-value sorted portfolios. The weight is obtained by dividing the market value of each portfolio by the sum of the market values of the 55 portfolios. The loadings on the alternative versions of TSF are obtained as in Table 4. Panel A shows the value-weighted impact for the entire sample period.

Following Cooper, Gutierrez and Hameed (2004), we estimate in Panel B the impact of the temperature shock factor in two sub-sample periods with the following regression:

IMPACT = i83−98D83−98 + i99−14D99−14 + et

where IMPACT is the impact in month t estimated based on 30-year rolling samples. Since our first observation is in t 1953:4, the first estimate is for 1983:4. It uses the construction of the TSF and loadings on this factor for the period 1953:4-1983:3 and multiplies the value-weighted loadings by the TSF realization for 1983:4 to obtain IMPACT1983:4. We then roll everything forward by a month to find IMPACT1983:5, etc. D83-98 is equal to 1 for all months in the period 1983-1998 and zero otherwise, and D99-14 is equal to 1 for 1999-2014 and zero otherwise. The mean impact in 1983-1998 is i83-98, while that in 1999-2014 is i99-14. To test whether the mean impacts are equal, we run the following regression:

IMPACT = a + iDifferencet D99−14 + et

The impact difference is iDifference. The t-ratios are based on Newey-West HAC standard errors with the lag parameter set equal to 12. The subsample results are presented in Panel B.

# Table 6. Time-series and cross-sectional tests with the tracking portfolio based on 10 industry portfolios

We use 10 industry-size-value portfolios (SL and SH for each portfolio in the Fama-French five-industry classification) as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio TSF10. Panel A provides the tracking portfolio coefficients on each portfolio, Newey-West standard errors are based on 24 lags. Panels B and C present the time-series and cross-sectional tests with TSF10 replacing TSF. Significance is evaluated by t-values based on the Shanken correction (EIV), the Shanken-Zhou correction (MIS), and a bootstrapping procedure p-value.

# Table 7. Robustness checks with the tracking portfolio

We run a number of tracking portfolio regressions, in which we use the contemporaneous temperature, one-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+3), two-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+6), three-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+9), and four-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+12) as the dependent variable. To remove the seasonality in monthly temperatures, we follow Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and use temperature anomalies, defined relative to the 1951-1980 average. The basis assets are six size-value portfolios in Panel A, and 10 industry-size and BM portfolios in Panel B. T-statistics use Newey-West standard errors with lag (bandwidth) determined as max[3, 2*horizon] following Bekaert and Hoerova (2014), where the horizon equals the number of months in the forecast interval.

# Table 8. Global temperatures, SMB, and HML

We report the tracking portfolio regressions for the global temperature in Panel A. The dependent variable in all cases is Tt+12, the average annual global temperature from t+1 to t+12. SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, and BH are excess returns: the Fama-French size-value portfolios net of the one-month T-Bill rate. RFt-1, DEFt-1, and TERMt-1 represent, respectively, the lagged one-month T-Bill rate, the lagged default risk premium, and the lagged term premium. t is the deterministic time trend. Cnsmr: Consumer Durables, NonDurables, Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services (Laundries, Repair Shops); Manuf: Manufacturing, Energy, and Utilities; HiTec: Business Equipment, Telephone and Television Transmission; Hlth: Healthcare, Medical Equipment, and Drugs; Other: Mines, Constr, BldMt, Trans, Hotels, Bus Serv, Entertainment, Finance. To adjust for the autororrelation in errors resulting from the overlapping temperature shock data, Newey-West standard errors are obtained to calculate the t-ratios employing a bandwidth of 24 months.

We separately regress SMB and HML on the temperature shock factor, and report the results in Panel B.

# Table 9. Climate sensitivity in high and low temperature-variation states

We retrieve state-level temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center, and rank the U.S. states according to the standard deviation of the state-level temperature from 1953 to 2015. We define the 10 states with the highest standard deviation of temperatures as high temperature-variation states (H), and the 10 states with the lowest standard deviation of temperatures as low temperature-variation states (L). We run time-series regressions to examine if firms in high temperature-variation states are more negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in low temperature-variation states. Section “Industry portfolios” present the results for five industry portfolios, those for the size-value portfolios are shown in Section “Size-value portfolios”. Standard t-statistics are presented in parentheses.

# Table 10. Climate sensitivity in Republican and Democrat states

If concerns about regulation drive temperature sensitivity, firms headquartered in states run by Democrats should be more exposed to temperature shocks than firms headquartered in states run by Republicans, given the different climate policies advocated by two parties. We form size-value as well as industry portfolios within Republican and Democrat states, and run time-series regressions to examine if firms in Republican states are less negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in Democrat states. Section “Industry portfolios” present the results for five industry portfolios, those for the size-value portfolios are shown in the section “Size-value portfolios”. Standard t-statistics are presented in parentheses.

# Abstract

Though their activities, companies have an impact on environmental problems and nature conservation. The accounting sector can play a role in environmental conservation efforts related to environmental costs, and the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) could be a key factor that can improve the company’s financial performance. This study aims to determine how green accounting through the application of CSMS can improve the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country. The sampling method used was purposive sampling, while the research sample consisted of 38 companies that had followed PROPER and were indexed on the IDX. Data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs by earmarking a portion to carry CSMS implementation so as to improve financial performance. People in Indonesia consider that manufacturing companies that have good company rankings in the evaluation program for company performance ratings in environmental management run by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment are in a position to generate customer loyalty, especially in financial performance.

# 1. Introduction

The increasingly numerous and varied human activities have an impact on the natural environment. People in meeting their daily needs can have an impact on the environment. Environmental impacts occur because humans tend to exploit natural resources from the environment in an excessive manner, not just maintaining the necessities of life. As a result of these human activities, the environment is damaged. Environmental damage is getting worse along with the development of industrial and technological companies. In the end, environmental damage has a negative impact on human life. On the one hand, industry has an impact on the environment, but on the other hand, the industrial world can have an impact on the economic development of a country. Companies in managing natural resources have the potential to impose negative risks on environmental aspects. For this reason, companies need to make a commitment to the environment and the social dimension as the main and inseparable part of the company’s operational activities. In making it happen, the company complements its operational activities with environmental management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations, for example, the Environmental Impact Analysis Documents. Environmental management efforts aim to estimate the impact that will arise from operations, evaluate, and find appropriate solutions to overcome them.

From the increasing impact of a company’s activities on environmental issues and nature conservation, the...

The accounting sector can play a role in environmental conservation efforts, namely, through voluntary disclosure in its financial statements related to environmental costs. An accounting system that discloses accounts related to environmental costs is known as green accounting. Disclosure of environmental activities and environmental costs in the company’s annual report will provide an overview to users of the company’s financial statements, which can help users make decisions for company programs related to environmental preservation in the future. The environmental conservation program carried out by the company will be positively perceived by the community. In the end, the community will have high trust in the company. The trust that arises will encourage people to be loyal to the company. Environmental performance can have a significant effect on a company’s financial position (Miroshnychenko et al., 2017). It also shows the need for adequate environmental cost information. Green accounting, in this case, is one of the sources of a company’s financial performance. Besides that, corporate sustainable development also plays an equally important role.

Sustainability stands out among the most vital management paradigms that key business leaders must react to today in search of competitive success (Bansal, 2005; Fakir & Jusoh, 2020). Bansal (2005), a leading author, argues that almost inevitably companies that do not react to sustainability will face extinction. Likewise, some say that the capability to incorporate sustainability into corporate strategy and stakeholder engagement will determine which businesses will grow in the 21st century and which businesses will fail (Andriosopoulos, 2016; Napitupulu et al., 2020). Considering these dauntless claims, it is obviously important to know how businesses adapt to sustainability. Azapagic (2003) formulates the concept of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) into five stages, namely, sustainable development policy, planning, implementation, communication, and review and corrective action. These five stages are conceptualized into four indicators, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental.

Companies are currently required to improve their performance, namely by increasing their productivity. Productivity can be measured by comparing output and input during the production process. In this case, the company is required to pay attention to consumer tastes by increasing the quality and quantity of its products. In terms of increasing production, companies experience many problems that arise in relation to corporate sustainability, namely, economic, technological, social, and environmental issues, starting from the level of efficiency and effectiveness of production costs as well as the waste production process. Companies in the production process must be able to develop an integrated, comprehensive, and efficient concept of sustainable and environmentally-friendly industries. The main objective of the green manufacturing is to save the environment and to reduce the cost of the product (Paul et al., 2014). Green accounting is a concept where companies in their production process prioritize efficiency and effectiveness in using resources in a sustainable manner, so that they are able to align company development with environmental functions and can provide benefits to the community (Nga et al., 2019). The problem raised in the research is whether green accounting through the implementation of CSMS can improve financial performance. Thus, this study aims to discuss how green accounting through the implementation of CSMS can improve the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country. Manufacturing companies generate a high level of environmental risk in Indonesia because they are directly related to the environment, where raw materials are taken directly from nature, with the impact of waste on the environment.

# 2. Literature Review and Hypotheses

# 2.1. Green Accounting

According to Cohen and Robbins (2011), green accounting is defined as: “a style of accounting that includes the indirect costs and benefits of economic activity, such as environmental effects and health consequences of business decisions and plans.”

Green accounting is a concept in which companies in their production processes prioritize efficiency and effectiveness in using resources in a sustainable manner, so that they are able to align company development with environmental functions and can provide benefits to society. In this case, the implementation of green accounting pays full attention to the concept of savings, namely, saving land, saving materials, and saving energy; it is based on the ecosystem concept. The aim of implementing green accounting is to increase the efficiency of environmental management by assessing environmental activities from the perspective of costs (environmental costs) and benefits or effects (economic benefits), as well as producing environmental protection effects. In short, the implementation of green accounting can provide information about the extent to which an organization or company makes a positive or negative contribution to the quality of human life and the environment.

Green accounting measures and recognizes environmental costs, other social costs, and presents information in the financial statements. In the last two decades, green accountants have approached one aspect of material cost accounting (Jasch, 2003; Nakajima et al., 2015). Accordingly, environmental costs include environmental protection.

# 2.2. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)

According to the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA), sustainability is based on a simple principle that can be interpreted as everything we need for the survival and well-being of life, which directly or indirectly affects the natural environment (www.epa.gov). Sustainability creates and maintains a condition in which humans and nature can live in harmony, which enables it to meet the social, economic and other needs of current and future generations. The concept of sustainability began to be introduced globally by the Brutland Commission in the Our Common Future reporting activity organized by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987). WCED connects sustainability with environmental and social integrity by creating a term called sustainable development which is defined as development that meets current needs without reducing the needs of future generations (WCED, 1987, p.43; (Linnenluecke & Griffiths, 2010).

# 2.3. Financial Performance

Performance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. According to Epstein et al. (2015), the company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability (Amacha & Dastane, 2017; Tabash, 2019). The result shows that the majority of oil and gas companies in Malaysia had poor performance in terms of sustainability disclosure. On all three chosen profitability parameters, the companies that practiced sustainability were found to perform better than their counterparts that did not. Strong and significant relationship exists between sustainability practices and better financial performance. Financial performance is an achievement assessment of a company that can be seen from the company’s ability to generate profits. Financial performance is a company work achievement that has been achieved by the company in a certain period and contained in the company’s financial statements, so that one of the information that can be known by interested parties or users of financial statements to find out corporate profits (Pujiasih, 2013). Financial ratios connect various estimates contained in financial statements so that the financial condition and results of operations of a company can be interpreted (Lucyanda & Siagian, 2012; Angelia & Suryaningsih, 2015; Manurung & Rachmat, 2019; Manurung et al., 2020). Financial accountability is an accurate and precise focus on reporting about the use of public funds. The main purpose is to ensure that public funds have been used for objectives that have been established efficiently and effectively (Atmadja & Saputra, 2018).

# 2.4. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)

Accounting, especially green accounting, is expected to be able to support the sustainable development of the company. Green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The company’s ability to apply green accounting in its business scope is expected to be able to manage costs related to the environment and, in the end, the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.

H1: Green accounting implementation is able to improve CSMS implementation.

# 2.5. Green Accounting in Financial Performance

When a company applies green accounting and is able to show a good environmental performance, the impact is on good financial performance. This has been proven in both academic and empirical research, which states that financial performance, in this case the market value of the company, is strongly influenced by environmental performance, where the effect is positive. The relationship between environmental performance and financial performance can be observed in terms of income and costs. From the income side, it can be explained that consumer preference for consumer-oriented products allows these companies to enjoy market differentiation, competitive advantages, and consumers have a tendency to be willing to pay higher prices for environmentally-oriented products (premium prices). On the cost side, there are many benefits that

Companies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. Thus, it can be explained through disclosure of environmental costs, that it will reflect the business ethics carried out by the company, as well as responsible management of resources. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability. According to Dutta et al. (2019) stated that green accounting issues relate to corporate profitability.

# H2: The implementation of green accounting is able to improve the financial performance.

# 2.6. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance

When integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values. It is necessary to set up corporate governance, which incorporates a positive response to the company’s social, economic and environmental risks and opportunities that have a potential to influence performance of the organization.

# H3: Implementing a CMS can improve financial performance.

# 3. Research Methodology

The population in this study was 154 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) for the 2018-2019 period. This study took a sample of publicly-traded companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management (PROPER) for 2018-2019. Purposive sampling was used, so a research sample of 38 companies was selected. The data analysis tool uses the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The currently drawn sample fulfills the required characteristics. In general, these characteristics are as follows:

1. The sample companies engaged in manufacturing that go public and are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and publish financial reports (annual reports) in 2018-2019.
2. The companies selected as samples were manufacturing companies that participated in the Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management for 2018-2019.

The number of samples of PROPER companies in the period 2018 to 2019 was 38 companies, so that the number of observations was 76, as shown in the following table.

# 3.1. Green Accounting

Green accounting is the company’s performance in creating a good (green) environment. Green accounting companies are measured by the company’s achievements in participating in the PROPER program, which is one of the efforts undertaken by the Ministry of Environment (KLH) to encourage corporate governance in environmental management through information instruments. The PROPER performance rating system includes the ranking of companies in five colors, which will be scored consecutively with the highest score of 5 for gold and the lowest score of 1 for black.

# 3.2. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)

Based on Dočekalová and Kocmanová (2016), the measurement of corporate sustainability is using Complex Performance Indicator (CPI). CPI integrates the environmental, social, economic and corporate governance performance of the company. CPI contains seventeen key performance indicators, which were determined from the basic set of performance indicators using statistical methods. CPI sums up the complex corporate performance into a single value, but, at the same time, the set of aggregated sub-indicators of individual performance areas enables a detailed analysis and determination of the impact of various performance areas and factors on the complex corporate performance. Figure 1 visualizes the scheme of composite corporate performance indicator - Complex Performance Indicator.

Based on the results of mediation analysis using PLS warp the following results are obtained: The summary of the modeling test results is shown in Table 2.

The results of the fit model and quality indices in Table 2 indicate that the research model meets all the conditions for fit from the research model, so that it is suitable for use in explaining the population.

# 3.3. Financial Performance

Performance is the relative performance of the company in a similar industry, which is indicated by the company’s annual return. The company’s financial performance is the result of many individual decisions made continuously by management. Therefore, to assess the financial performance of a company, it is necessary to analyze the cumulative financial and economic impacts of decisions and considering them using comparative measures. Financial performance is the determination of certain measures that can assess the success of a company in generating profits. In other words, the company’s financial performance can be seen from the level of company profitability. Measurement of the profitability ratio can use ROA (Return On Asset). Return On Assets, or also known as economic profitability, is operating profit with own capital and foreign capital used to generate profits and expressed as a percentage (Platonova et al., 2018). This ratio is used to measure the rate of return on investment that the company has made using all its assets.

# 4.2. Green Accounting in the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS)

The first hypothesis states that green accounting is able to improve CSMS in manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The analysis result shows that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.15, so that the first hypothesis can be accepted. This indicates that the increasing implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia is able to increase the implementation of CSMS. Accounting in this case, especially in green accounting, proves that it is able to support the sustainable development of the company. We know that green accounting is a part of accounting that is specifically able to manage costs related to the environment. The ability of companies to apply green accounting in their business, to be able to manage costs related to the environment and to have an impact on the company will be able to carry out sustainable development. The results of this study are aligned with the research by Miroshnychenko et al. (2017) that states that green accounting can have a significant effect on the company’s financial position.

# 3.4. Analysis

The analysis technique used in this research is inferential statistical analysis to explain the causal relationship between variables. The inferential statistical method used in data analysis in this study is variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which is known as the Partial Least Square (PLS) method, with the PLS warp tool. The research model is shown in Figure 2.

# 4.3. Green Accounting on Financial Performance

The second hypothesis states that increasing green accounting can improve financial performance. The analysis results show that the significance is 0.01 with a coefficient of 0.27.

# Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business Vol 7 No 12 (2020) 731–738

I Dewa Made ENDIANA, Ni Luh Gd Mahayu DICRIYANI, Md Santana Putra ADIYADNYA, I Putu Mega Juli Semara PUTRA

These results indicate that the company implementing green accounting is able to show good environmental performance, so the impact is on good financial performance. So, the second hypothesis can be accepted. The effect of green accounting with financial performance can be observed in terms of revenue and costs. Increased implementation of green accounting in manufacturing companies in Indonesia can maximize revenue potential and increase efficiency in terms of costs. On the cost side, there are many benefits that companies get as a result of increasing efficiency, avoiding potential liabilities, being better positioned to meet or exceed standards, and creating entry barriers for potential competitors. This will increase the social trust of stakeholders such as the public and consumers, which in turn will be able to improve financial performance, such as achieving maximum company profitability.

# 4.4. Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) in Financial Performance

The third hypothesis states that the implementation of CSMS can improve financial performance. The results showed a significance of 0.02 with a coefficient of 0.22, so that the hypothesis was accepted. This indicates that CSMS is able to create and maintain a condition, which can guarantee that a business can survive for a long time, so that it can lead to consumer and market loyalty so as to increase financial performance. When integrating the concept of sustainability, the company should develop management models and strategies that will lead to the creation of social, environmental and economic values.

# 5. Conclusions

Allocation of environmental costs in green accounting through the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) is one of the strategic policies for manufacturing companies in Indonesia, so that it can improve financial performance, because it is related to company policies in allocating costs to environmental activities, investment, and funding. Therefore, the company’s decision to allocate environmental costs must be in line with consumer needs and consider the company’s capabilities.

The results of this study indicate that manufacturing companies in Indonesia, a developing country, are able to implement green accounting by allocating appropriate environmental costs and in accordance with their portion so as to improve financial performance either directly or indirectly. The public assesses that companies that have a good ranking in the company performance rating program in environmental management by the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment have good prospects for financial performance.

Manufacturing companies in Indonesia, whose production process is directly related to the environment and based on the results of research that the public highly assesses companies from the perspective of their environmental responsibility, can hope to continue to maintain and improve the planning and allocation of environmental costs in the production process. The government, in this case the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI), should make accounting policies and standards related to green accounting the company’s legal basis for accounting. This study only examined manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Future researchers should try to use other sector companies, so they can find out whether environmental issues can occur in all types of businesses.

# Abstract

This study provides evidence on the existence of a negative Greenium, i.e. a risk premium linked to firms’ greenness and environmental transparency, based on European individual stock returns. We define a priced ‘greenness and transparency’ factor based on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures. Based on this factor, we offer a tool to assess the exposure of a portfolio to the risk associated with the low-carbon transition, and hedge against it. We estimate that in a stressed scenario where greener and more transparent firms very much outperform brown stocks, there would be losses at the global level, including for European large banks, should investors fail to price climate-transition risks. These results call for the introduction of climate stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.

# 1 Introduction

Climate change is a fact, but we are not sure what the economic costs associated with this change will be.1 By the same token, it is difficult to estimate what the economic benefits of doing something about it would be. In particular, it would be hard to pin down the net present value of activities aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as those directed to broader environmental objectives such as the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling, pollution prevention and control, and the protection of healthy ecosystems.2 At the same time, the consequences of a transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient and circular economy, or lack thereof, are also largely uncertain. Hence, these issues have to be addressed as aspects of long-run risk. The contribution of this paper is to measure the added value of greener economic activities in terms of market excess returns. To do so, we first show that indeed, the European market prices climate risk in the form of a greenness and environmental transparency factor, in the context of a standard asset pricing model. Second, we estimate that the market associates a negative risk premium, which we label Greenium, to more environmentally friendly and transparent firms.

We identify the greenness and transparency factor based on a precise definition. In particular, we first construct portfolios characterized by a different shade of green and a different degree of environmental transparency. This is based on firm-level information on greenhouse gas (GHG) or CO2 emissions, combined with a measure of the completeness of firms’ environmental disclosures, to yield a synthetic greenness and transparency index for each stock. Companies which disclose a lower emission intensity, and are very transparent, attain the highest scores and are included in a greener and more transparent portfolio. The most straightforward example of greener companies would be those with a large share of their turnover in green economic sectors, e.g. renewable energy. Conversely, companies which do not disclose information on their environmental performance are labeled as non-transparent. Among these nontransparent companies, those active in carbon-intensive sectors, e.g. companies operating coal power plants, are included in a brown portfolio. The greenness and transparency factor is constructed based on 942 companies listed on the STOXX Europe Total Market Index.

By relying on company-level disclosures and factoring-in their transparency, we try to tackle the issue of green-washing, which is likely to be the reason why the literature has so far failed to find a consensus on the existence of a priced green factor. Indeed, looking at the actual composition of the portfolios of publicly traded investment funds which label themselves as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’, it turns out that many funds are clearly less environmentally friendly than their name would suggest. For example, a fund might indeed limit its exposure to carbon-intensive sectors, but at the same time mainly invest in e.g. financial stocks. Banks, insurers and other financial institutions are admittedly directly responsible for a very small fraction of GHG emissions, but financial institutions are prob-

1 On the uncertainty on the rate of increase in average temperatures in the long-medium horizon, and on the effects of climate change, see e.g. Pindyck (2013). 2 These objectives are listed in the European Commission Action plan on financing sustainable growth, which sets out an EU strategy for sustainable finance.

ably not what comes to mind when thinking of companies that are at the forefront of efforts to reduce emissions. At the level of the individual company, there could be a tendency to disclose only partial information, emphasizing the environmental dimensions where the firm performs best and neglecting those where the firm does not as well. For example, a car manufacturer may report its scope 1 GHG emissions, i.e. emissions from sources that it owns or controls, but could have an incentive not to disclose its scope 3 emissions, which include emissions resulting from the use of the vehicles it produces and sells. By considering the completeness of the relevant information that firms disclose, we deal with this type of greenwashing.

At the same time, however, one should be careful not to take extreme views when defining ‘green’ stocks. As a matter of fact, portfolio diversification is crucial for asset managers, and concentrating the exposure on a small set of pure green players is not a viable option. Our society will still need e.g. steel and cement for quite a while, and companies’ low-carbon transition is a much needed but gradual process. For all these reasons, a sensible approach would be to broaden the scope of the definition of ‘green’ beyond pure players to also include firms that meet the highest level of energy efficiency and the lowest CO2 emissions within the relevant sector. By taking this approach, a steel manufacturer which also uses scrap steel is greener than one that does not. By the same token, an energy company that reduces its reliance on fossil fuels – though not having an entirely renewable energy mix – is greener than one that is not reducing its carbon footprint. This is the approach taken by several providers of environmental ratings, which assess the sustainability of firms relative to their peers, and also the one we take in this paper.

We show that in the context of a standard asset pricing model, the portfolios we build based on firms’ environmental performance and disclosures are associated with a positive intercept, suggesting the existence of an omitted factor. Based on this evidence, we propose to include a greenness and transparency factor, which we construct based on a long-short strategy involving the greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio. We find that the Greenium, i.e. the risk premium associated with this greenness and transparency factor, is negative and highly statistically significant. This means that investors accept a lower remuneration for their investments, ceteris paribus, insofar as these investments are linked to greener and more transparent firms. We interpret this as evidence of climate risk being viewed as significant, with the market seeing value in investing in greener assets as a hedging strategy towards worse environmental outcomes.

Indeed, in a scenario of heightened risks resulting from climate change, there would be a stronger push towards more environmentally friendly activities, with more decisive political action likely to be taken to promote sustainable growth. Hence, companies active in green sectors and more transparent on their environmental performance would operate in a more favorable environment, possibly supported by incentives, e.g. fiscal or of other nature. At the same time, the likelihood would increase that some assets, e.g. coal, would become stranded. In this context, forward-looking investors who base their portfolio allocation on a broader information set than past returns, invest in greener assets already today.

The evidence we provide on the existence of a Greenium has clear financial stability implications. Indeed, we show that the European market as a whole does price climate risk. In this context, if an investor does not factor in

Climate risk in the construction of her portfolio, she is in fact pricing her holdings based on a misspecified model, where the greenness and environmental transparency factor is omitted. Should this mispricing affect the assets held by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) such as large banks, insurers and pension funds, there could be consequences in terms of systemic risk. In particular, asset returns on their holdings could be negatively affected by climate change via two main channels. First, in a longer horizon perspective, more frequent and severe natural catastrophes stemming from climate change (e.g. typhoons and floods) could negatively affect returns on assets linked to particularly vulnerable economic activities. These are the so-called physical risks related to climate change, that we do not tackle in this paper directly. However, it has been shown that rising temperatures have strong adverse effects on asset valuations, as well as on key macroeconomic aggregates and productivity (see Donadelli et al., 2017). Second, in a medium-term perspective, the implementation of sustainable finance policies will imply higher costs for firms with higher emissions, causing a generalized drop in the dividend that brown firms will be able to pay to their shareholders. In parallel, carbon-intensive assets will increasingly become ‘stranded’ (see Campiglio et al., 2017). This is the so-called transition risk. These two channels characterize a climate risk factor that investors should price.

Based on our model, we estimate that in an extreme but plausible scenario where greener and more transparent companies outperform brown companies, all institutional sectors at the global level, including e.g. governments, non-financial institutions and financial corporations, as well as all European SIFIs, would be hit by losses. By halving their exposure to carbon-intensive sectors and reallocating their investments towards greener assets, investors could somewhat reduce the loss. However, they could only avoid losing money if they would reallocate their investments towards greener and more transparent firms. The magnitude of the expected losses we estimate is admittedly not breathtaking. Still, we show that no one is in a safe place when it comes to climate risk, as the consequences of brown asset mispricing would be widespread. Moreover, our analysis is limited to equity holdings, that for some investors are not as relevant as other types of exposures. In a stressed scenario, however, losses would almost certainly be recorded also on the bond portfolio and notably, on banks’ loan exposure. Finally, we use a simple model to compute losses, based on the marginal expected shortfall. This approach does not factor in losses resulting from second-round effects, like fire sales, which could magnify first-round losses. Taking all this into account, we conclude that a climate or climate-policy shock could have serious implications in terms of financial stability, especially if coupled with shocks of other nature. Hence, we argue that a climate stress test is warranted for systemically important institutions to monitor their resilience to climate change. The greenness and transparency factor we construct could indeed be used by investors, to hedge against climate risk, and by supervisors, to measure SIFIs exposure to this risk. Notice that looking ahead, we can only expect greater policy pressure to reducing carbon.

# emissions and moving to a sustainable development path.

The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide an overview of the relevant literature. In Section 3, we present our synthetic greenness and transparency indicator at the level of the individual company. Section 4 outlines the asset pricing theoretical framework. In Section 5, we present the results of the empirical application. First, we focus on portfolios by estimating the standard asset pricing models and defining the greenness and transparency factor. Then, we estimate our proposed model on individual stocks. In Section 6 we carry out a battery of robustness checks. Section 7 tests the performance of the equity portfolios of global institutional sectors and European SIFIs in a climate-stressed scenario. Section 8 concludes.

# 2 Related literature

This paper stands at the crossroad of sustainable finance, asset pricing and financial stability. The sustainable finance literature has so far mostly focused on corporate performance, starting from the seminal work by Bragdon and Marlin (1972). They asked the fundamental question, whether there would be a reward for a company’s virtue. Trying to answer this question, Porter (1991), Gore (1993), and Porter and van der Linde (1995) argue that improving a company environmental performance can lead to a better economic or financial performance, not necessarily accompanied by an increase in costs. Ambec and Lanoie (2008) review several empirical works showing that improvements in the environmental performance of a firm tend to be associated with improvements in its economic or financial performance, owing to potential revenue increases and/or cost cuts. More recently, Hoepner et al. (2018) show that engagement on sustainability issues can benefit shareholders’ by reducing firms’ downside risks.

Despite increasingly available evidence on the performance of green or sustainable corporates, however, no consensus has yet been reached in the asset pricing literature about the performance of green assets, or on environmental risk being a priced macro factor. Evidence based on a large number of studies on the performance of sustainable investment funds compared with conventional peers (e.g., Statman, 2000; Renneboog et al., 2007; Seitz, 2010) is mixed. For example, Hartzmark and Sussman (2019) find that sustainability is viewed as positively predicting future performance; however, they do not find evidence of outperformance of ‘high sustainability’ investment funds vs ‘low sustainability’ ones. Trinks et al. (2018) show that divesting from fossil fuels does not impair portfolio performance. On the contrary, Bolton and Kacperczyk (2019) find that stocks of companies with higher CO2 emission intensity earn higher returns. Other analyses based on publicly traded environmental portfolios find that green stocks are, on average, underperforming the market. This finding would indicate that investors are willing to earn comparatively less on these assets because they are hedging an environmental long-run risk. Finally, recent papers attempt to build climate risk hedging portfolios (see Engle et al., 2020, Choi et al., 2020, Hong et al., 2019, Alok).

Andersson et al. (2016) shows that divestment in higher emission stocks entails a cost, which investors are more likely to bear the stronger the perception of a serious commitment on the side of policymakers towards fighting climate change.

et al., 2020 and Goergen et al., 2019, Monasterolo and De Angelis, 2020); however, none of these works goes all the way to quantifying the associated risk premium.

Finally, the financial stability literature has started to put forward the idea of ‘climate stress tests’ on the exposures of financial institutions (see Battiston et al., 2017 and Battiston and Monasterolo, 2018), as well as to develop climate stress-test methodologies for e.g. loan portfolios (see Monasterolo et al., 2018). Central Banks and international institutions, starting with the seminal speech by Carney (2015), have also emphasized on different occasions that climate change could affect systemic risk. In particular, Gros et al. (2016) distinguishes between a benign scenario, with a gradual transition to a low-carbon economy, and an adverse scenario, where the transition occurs more abruptly. In both cases, there could be financial stability consequences: with a too slow transition, the Paris Agreement goal would be missed and the catastrophic consequences of climate change would become unavoidable.5 A too quick transition, on the other hand, would imply a sudden repricing of brown assets. We provide evidence that these concerns are shared by the market.

# 3 Synthetic greenness and transparency indicator

Different indicators are available to assess a company’s commitment to the environment. However, identifying synthetic proxies for firms’ environmental performance is not obvious and no consensus has yet been reached in the literature on this issue (see Oikonomou et al., 2012). The main source of information in this respect are firms’ environmental disclosures, which are typically published by companies in their annual reports, or in separate Corporate Social Responsibility or Sustainability reports, as well as in dedicated ESG releases or Corporate Governance reports. Based on these disclosures, investors distinguish companies that are doing green business from firms that are not, or that are not transparent in this respect. However, a single indicator might not be sufficient to ensure a careful assessment of a company’s environmental performance. Hence, we look at both of the following two dimensions: i) environmental transparency, related to the quality of firms’ environmental disclosures, and ii) GHG emissions.

As a proxy for the environmental transparency of a company we use the Bloomberg Environmental disclosure score, which we refer to as E score.6 This is an index quantifying the completeness of a firm’s disclosure on its impact on the environment. The E score embraces several environmental aspects of a firm’s business. In particular, it looks at how transparent a company is with respect to its carbon emissions, air and water pollution, its commitment to the protection of biodiversity, and its waste management, among others. The weighted E score is normalized to range from zero for companies that do not disclose environmental data to 100 for those which disclose detailed information for each pillar. The score is also tailored for industry sectors, and each component is weighted based on its importance. In particular, GHG emission disclosure is attached the highest weight.

5 The objective of the Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, is to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

6 MSCI, RobecoSAM, Sustainalytics and Asset4 also provide E disclosure scores based on different methodologies.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

We use the E score as a measure of the transparency of a firm with respect to its environmental sustainability commitment, and assume that higher commitment is associated with higher transparency. In other words, based on the E score, we make a first selection among firms that are transparent, at least to some extent, about their environmental performance, and firms that are not. We do not claim that firms that do not disclose information on environmental issues are necessarily ecologically destructive. However, we find it legitimate to label them as non-green, as their environmental commitment appears weaker compared to firms that do disclose (quantitative) information on this pillar. Moreover, Marquis et al. (2016) show that more environmentally friendly firms tend to disclose more because they know that their environmental performance is generally better than the one of their peers, while more environmentally damaging firms are indeed less likely to engage in non-mandatory disclosure, in particular in those countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and norms.

To build a comprehensive index of a company’s environmental performance, we combine this transparency measure with quantitative disclosure on emissions. In particular, we consider the total GHG emission intensity, i.e. the total amount on GHG emissions normalized by revenues. If this is not available, we take the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, weighted by revenues. The synthetic greenness and transparency indicator Gi,y of company i at year y is defined as the weighted average of the two components, as follows:

Gi,y = γKi,y + (1 − γ)Ei,y , with γ ∈ [0, 1],

(1)

where Ki,y is the inverse of the ranking of firm i in term of emission intensity, and Ei,y is the ranking of firm i in term of E score. The parameter γ controls for the relative importance of the two components of the index. We set γ = 0.5 as benchmark case, and show results for γ = 0.2 and γ = 0.8 as robustness checks in Section 6. More transparent companies, for a given level of intensity of GHG or CO2 emissions, are associated with larger values of the indicator Gi,y. Firms that attain a lower emission intensity, for a given level of transparency, are also associated with larger values of Gi,y.

Figure 1 shows the number of companies in our sample which did some environmental disclosure, from 2005 to 2017 (yellow bar). The figure also reports the number of firms that disclosed their emission intensity in a given year (gray bar). The number of companies reporting on their environmental performance has exhibited an upward trend in the last ten years, reaching around 700 EUROSTOXX companies in 2017, i.e. more than half of the sample.

The indicators we use to build the synthetic greenness and transparency indicator have some limitations. First, the analysis provided in Section 5 includes data from 2005, while the Bloomberg ESG application was launched only in 2009. This potentially introduces look-ahead bias (see, e.g., Derwall et al., 2005). However, this bias is mitigated by the availability of firms’ environmental disclosures, including on GHG emissions, also prior to 2009. In other words, market participants could start using the Bloomberg E score as such only as of 2009, but the information.

Figures 2 and 3 in the Appendix plot the greenness and transparency indicator, as well as its components, for two representative companies.

This index is based on was already available to the market. A second issue relates to the self-reported nature of GHG emissions, as well as of other environmental disclosures. As a matter of fact, the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) only requires auditors to verify the publication of non-financial disclosures by relevant firms, but there are no assessment and verification requirements on the content of non-financial disclosures. Based on this, we should emphasize that those firms we identify as greener based on their environmental disclosures may actually be less green than they claim. Still, our asset pricing analysis should not be affected by this problem, insofar as investors base their decisions only on publicly available information as we do. Related to the issue of self-reporting is that of self-selection, due to the fact that unless firms are subject to the NFRD, they are free to choose whether to disclose environmental information. Those that are subject to the NFRD, can choose what to disclose in particular. Typically, self-selection may introduce a bias in the analysis. However, in our case self-selection works in the right direction, as greener firms have an incentive to disclose more and in our framework, firms that are characterized by a lower emission intensity and better environmental disclosures are correctly identified as greener and more transparent. Still, we miss information on those firms that do not disclose. Finally, ESG ratings may differ quite substantially across different data providers, as shown by a growing stream of empirical literature, including, among others, Chatterji et al. (2016), Escrig-Olmedo et al. (2019), and Berg et al. (2019). This latter paper, for example, shows that there is much more disagreement among raters on environmental ratings compared to credit ratings, but still less compared to social and governance ratings. To partly account for the limited reliability of environmental ratings and scores, we use the E score in combination with quantitative data on carbon emissions. We also show Performing the analysis from January 2010 to August 2018 yields empirical results in line with the ones provided in Section 5. See Directive 2014/95/EU. On this point, Short and Toffel (2008) document that firms tend to disclose more when they are immune from prosecution for self-disclosed violations.

that using only one or the other component of the greenness and transparency indicator does not yield meaningful results (see Section 6).

Finally, among non-transparent firms, we further select a subsample that we label ‘brown’. These are companies which are mainly active in sectors characterized by a comparatively higher level of carbon emissions. Information on sectoral emissions in Europe is provided by Eurostat, at the NACE-2 digit level.10 Table 9 in the Appendix lists the economic sectors responsible for the largest amount of carbon emissions in the EU. Overall, these sectors account for 85% of the total GHG emissions in the EU over the 2008-2017 period. Table 10 in the Appendix lists the companies that are included in the brown portfolio in 2017.

# 4 Linear factor model

We assume an approximate factor structure for excess returns combined with the absence of arbitrage opportunities to obtain asset pricing restrictions. As the greenness and transparency indicator defined in Equation (1) is only available for a relatively short sample, we opt for a time-invariant model, which assumes that the exposition of an asset i to each observable factor does not evolve over time. We acknowledge that a model that accounts for time variation in parameters and hence in risk premia would be best suited in this context, owing to the fact that awareness on climate issues has increased over time. However, a time-varying model for the excess returns could only be estimated on a much longer time series and a much larger cross-section than ours. Indeed, it would imply introducing functional specifications for the coefficients, which would result in an incidental parameter problem.

Let us define the excess return on asset i = 1, ..., n at time t = 1, 2, ...T as Ri,t = ri,t − rf,t, where ri,t is the log-return and rf,t is the risk-free return. We assume that the excess return Ri,t satisfies the following linear factor model:

Ri,t = ai + ∑k=1Kbi,kft,k + εi,t,K (2)

where ft,k is the k-th observable factor, with k = 1, ..., K. The error term εi,t is such that E[εi,t|Ft−1] = 0, and Cov[εi,t, ft|Ft−1] = 0, where Ft−1 is the lagged information set. The approximate factor structure holds for the variance-covariance of the error terms, i.e., Σε,t,n = [Cov[εi,t, εj,t|Ft−1]]i,j=1,...,n with bounded largest eigenvalue (see, e.g., Chamberlain and Rothschild, 1983). The following parameter restriction holds:11

ai = ∑k=1Kbi,kνk (3)

where νk is a parameter defined for each k-th factor. The asset pricing restriction in Equation (3) can be rewritten as the usual linear relation between expected excess returns and risk premia:

Source: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database.

We refer to Gagliardini et al. (2016) for theoretical results and proofs.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

E[Ri,t] = ∑bi,kλk.K (4)

Based on Equations (3) and (4), the time-invariant risk premium associated to each k-th factor is the following:

λk = E[ft,k] + νk. (5)

The risk premium λk is the sum of the expected return on the factor, which can be estimated as its first moment, plus the parameter νk, defined in the asset pricing restriction (3). Risk premia measure how much investors are willing to pay to hedge the systematic risk captured by the observable factors. When the factors are asset returns themselves (i.e., factors are tradable) and are assumed to be priced by the same model in (2), the risk premia are equal to the factor means (see, e.g., Jagannathan and Wang, 2002). However, if factors are non tradable, the parameter νk is non zero. Following Gagliardini et al. (2016), we do not assume a priori that the factors ft,k are tradable. Hence, we allow for the existence of market imperfections, such as transactions costs due to rebalancing and short selling, which are captured by ν (see e.g., Cremers et al., 2012).

Our baseline factor models are summarized in the table below.

|Model|Reference|Abbreviation|Factors|K|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Four-factor model|Carhart (1997)|CAR|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fmom,t|4|
|Three-factor model|Fama and French (1993)|3FF|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t|3|
|Capital Asset Pricing Model|Sharpe (1964); Lintner (1965)|CAPM|fm,t|1|

The factors that are included in the models are the following: 1) fm,t is the market factor, defined as the excess return on the European value-weighted market portfolio over the risk free rate; 2) fsmb,t is the size factor, defined as the average return on small caps minus the average return on big caps; 3) fhml,t is the book-to-market factor, defined as the average return on the value portfolio (i.e. stocks that have market value that is small relative to the book value) minus the average return on the growth portfolio; 4) fmom,t is the momentum factor, defined as the average of the returns for the winner portfolio, based on past returns, minus the average of the returns for the loser portfolio. Fama and French (2015) propose a five-factor model including the three Fama-French factors plus profitability and investment factors. However, we do not consider the five-factor model as four factors are enough to explain excess returns in a time-invariant specification, as shown by Gagliardini et al. (2019). By analogy with the fm,t factor, which is constructed based on the T-bill, we proxy the risk free rate with the 30-day T-bill beginning-of-month yield. The time series of European factors and the risk free rate are available on Kenneth French’s website.

# 5 Empirical analysis

In this section, we first compare greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio based on the models introduced in the previous section. Then, we propose an observable greenness and transparency factor defined as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio and those on the brown portfolio. Finally, we estimate the Greenium, i.e. the risk premium associated to the greenness and transparency factor, using a set of European individual stocks. Our sample spans from January 2006 to August 2018, covering all individual stocks included in the STOXX Europe Total Market Index (TMI) on August 2018.12 The STOXX Europe TMI covers approximately 95% of the free float market capitalization across 17 European countries.13 In principle, we could estimate our model on all 20K European listed firms. However, enlarging the sample would only marginally increase its coverage in terms of market capitalization, while it may jeopardize the results owing to the quality of the information that we would feed into the model. Indeed, the reliability of the data we use for our application crucially depends on the quality of environmental disclosures of European firms. On this matter, the NFRD imposes mandatory disclosures only on larger firms (with more than 500 employees). To be on the safe side, we construct our greenness and transparency factor based on a sample which is more reliable in terms of data quality, insofar as it is based on a market index, and still representative of the market as a whole. We present an application on a much larger sample in Section 6.

As in Fama and French (2008), we exclude financial firms (i.e., companies classified in sectors with NACE code K or L). The final dataset comprises n = 942 stocks. Stock returns and stock market capitalization data are sourced from Bloomberg. The panel is unbalanced, i.e., asset returns are not available for all firms at all dates. To account for publication lags, in each given year we use environmental disclosures for the previous reference year.

# 5.1 Portfolio analysis and the Greenness and Transparency Factor

As described in Section 3, we distinguish between transparent and non-transparent companies. The former belong to set T while the latter belong to set Tc. At each month t, we define the returns on the transparent and non-transparent portfolios, i.e. ˜t and ˜c, respectively, as follows:

rt

˜t = ∑i∈Twiri,t,

˜c = ∑i∈Tcwiri,t,

where the weight is defined as wi = MCi,t/ ∑MCi,t, with MCi,t being the market capitalization of stock i at month t.

Focusing on transparent firms, we study the returns on different portfolios characterized by different shades of green and degrees of transparency. In particular, we build portfolios of returns ˜q corresponding to the quintiles q = 1, ..., 5 of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator considering only firms belonging to the set T.

12This allows us to avoid survivor bias in the data.

13These are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The portfolio built on the fifth quintile includes top-ranked firms in terms of environmental performance and disclosures and is labeled ‘greener and more transparent’ portfolio. The returns on this portfolio are indicated as rt ˜g.

Focussing on non-transparent firms, we build the brown portfolio by including companies in Tc which are active in one or more of the industries characterized by the highest emissions, as described in Section 3. The returns on this portfolio are indicated as ˜b. Table 12 in the Appendix reports descriptive statistics for firms included in portfolios characterized by various shades of green and transparency. It shows that the various portfolios are comparable in terms of average size of the companies and firms’ leverage, while firms in the non-transparent and brown portfolio tend to have a slightly better RoA compared to greener and more transparent firms.

# 1. Descriptive Statistics for Returns

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the returns on various portfolios, namely the one including all transparent firms ˜R, the greener and more transparent portfolio ˜Rg, the portfolio including all non-transparent firms ˜Rc, and the brown portfolio ˜b. With respect to the relative performance of the various types of firms, and looking at the mean return, the non-transparent portfolio has outperformed the others, followed by the brown and the transparent.

A sounder way to assess the performance of a portfolio is the Sharpe ratio, which relates the mean performance to the standard deviation of the returns on a portfolio. In terms of Sharpe ratio, the non-transparent portfolio still outperforms the others, which have a similarly better performance than the market. Neither the mean return nor the Sharpe ratio are monotone in greenness and transparency, which is explained by the fact that the environmental characterization of a portfolio is only one of the determinants of its performance (see below). Finally, the distribution of returns for all the portfolios is characterized by excess kurtosis and negative skewness.

# Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Returns

|Portfolio|Mean|Std|Kurt|Skew|Sharpe|t-stat|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|˜R|1.102|0.497|3.744|-0.391|0.204|2.522|
|˜Rg|0.943|0.502|4.097|-0.593|0.188|2.315|
|˜Rc|1.732|0.586|5.210|-0.632|0.296|3.643|
|˜b|1.425|0.638|6.985|-0.909|0.224|2.754|

Taking a closer look at transparent firms, Table 13 in the Appendix reports descriptive statistics for quintile.

In the asset pricing literature there is no univocal choice on which percentiles of the distribution one should use for the construction of the relevant portfolios. For example, Ang et al. (2006) use quintiles, Baker and Wurgler (2006) use deciles, and Ahern (2013) use terciles. In general, the choice of the relevant percentiles is the result of a trade-off between the need to maximize heterogeneity between the two portfolios, and the need to ensure a large enough portfolio size. In our case, the top decile selects only a small number of stocks (as low as 13 in 2005), while terciles fail to identify the top firms in terms of environmental performance and transparency. Robustness checks using deciles and terciles are presented in Table 11 the Appendix.

Building portfolios based on the percentiles of the distribution of some relevant firm characteristic is standard in the asset pricing literature. It should be emphasized, however, that this is a relative approach to the classification of firms. In particular, a firm may cease to be included in the ‘greenest and more transparent’ portfolio if other firms reduce their emission intensity or improve their environmental disclosures, or if greener and/or more transparent firms are included in the sample, even if its environmental performance and transparency are unchanged in absolute terms.

portfolios 1-5, with portfolio R˜5 being the same as portfolio R˜g , i.e. the top green and transparent portfolio, while portfolio R˜1 includes comparatively higher emitting and less transparent firms, among those that do some environmental disclosure. Also in this case, the average return decreases as the level of the greenness and transparency indicator increases, though not monotonically (see Ciciretti et al., 2019 for a similar result based on an ESG characterization of firms). The same result holds when looking at the Sharpe ratio.

We investigate the drivers of the excess returns for the portfolios described above by considering the reference models described in Section 4. In particular, Table 2 reports the estimated factor loadings for the Cahart model (CAR), the three-factor Fama-French model (3FF), and the CAPM. Results are reported for the various portfolios. Overall, results are in line with the literature with respect to the market, size, value, and momentum factors, indicating that the portfolios we analyze are rather standard with respect to these dimensions. In particular, the estimated factor loading for the market factor bˆm is positive and significant across all models and portfolios. However, for the transparent as well as for the greener and more transparent portfolios, the exposition to the market factor is lower compared to the non-transparent and brown portfolios. This means that more transparent and greener firms tend to be less correlated with the market compared to more opaque and browner firms. The performance of the various portfolios can also be explained by the different loadings on the other factors. In particular, the exposition with respect to the size factor, bˆsmb, enters with a negative sign for the transparent and greener and more transparent portfolios, on the one hand, and a positive sign for the non-transparent and brown portfolios, on the other hand. This suggests that greener and transparent firms correlate more with bigger firms, while non-transparent and brown firms correlate more with smaller firms. Indeed, based on Table 12, firms in the greener and more transparent portfolio exhibit a slightly larger mean size as measured by total assets. As for the value factor ˆhml, the estimated loading is always negative and significant, except for the brown portfolio for which it is negative but non significant. Negative loadings on the value factor might mean that the portfolios include a comparatively larger share of firms with a lower book-to-market value. Considering the Carhart model, the coefficient on the momentum factor is not significant, except for the transparent portfolio. Looking at the explanatory power of the various models with respect to the different portfolios, the adjusted R-squared is lower for the brown portfolio based on all the models. Finally, the intercept is positive and significant for all portfolios and models, suggesting the existence of an omitted factor.

We define the greenness and transparency factor as the difference between the monthly returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio and those of the brown portfolio. Formally:

fg,t = ˜g− ˜.rt rb t

# 5.2 Asset pricing analysis

In this section we investigate whether the greenness and transparency factor defined in Equation (7) affects the cross-section of European stock returns. Further, we test whether investors accept lower (higher) compensation for holding environmentally friendly stocks by searching for a negative (positive) risk premium, i.e. a Greenium. The excess return Ri,t follows the model in Equations (2)-(3). In particular, we consider the same linear factor models used in the previous section, adding the greenness and transparency factor fg among the observable factors as follows:

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

|Model|Factors|K|
|---|---|---|
|CAR + G|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fmom,t, fg,t|5|
|3FF + G|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fg,t|4|
|CAPM + G|fm,t, fg,t|2|

The risk premium associated with the greenness and transparency factor is defined as follows:

λg = E[fg,t] + νg . (8)

In order to estimate the risk premia for the observable factors using individual stocks, we follow the estimation procedure proposed in Gagliardini et al. (2016). This procedure allows to deal with unbalanced panels, hence allowing to estimate the model on individual stocks rather than portfolios, and involves the following steps. First, we estimate the linear factor model by using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator. Second, we use the fitted residuals to test whether the model is correctly specified. In particular, we compute the diagnostic criterion proposed in Gagliardini et al. (2019), which checks whether the error terms share at least one unobserved common factor. Based on our sample, the criterion does not detect any common factor for the residuals, suggesting the validity of the factor structure.16 Third, we compute the cross-sectional estimator νk from (3) by Weighted Least Squares (WLS). Finally, the estimate of the risk premium ˆk for each factor is given by the sum of the expected λ return on the factor E[fk,t] and the estimate of ˆk.ν

Table 4 shows the estimated risk premia attached to the factors, including the Greenium, as well as the estimates for νk. Looking at the first two columns of the table, almost all risk premia are significant across the board, and have the expected signs. In particular, the estimated risk premia for the market, size, value and momentum factors are comparable with the results in Gagliardini et al. (2016) and Chaieb et al. (2018). The estimated Greenium is negative and significant at the 1% level in all cases. A negative Greenium indicates that investors accept lower compensation, ceteris paribus, to hold assets that correlate positively with the greenness and transparency factor, i.e. greener and more environmentally transparent assets. The mainstream interpretation of this result is based on the assumption that investors only care about their portfolios’ future payoffs. Hence, if they accept a lower remuneration to hold a certain type of assets, this must be because by doing so they are hedging some risks. In this specific case, holding greener and more transparent stocks constitutes a hedging strategy against climate risk. In the case of more environmentally friendly and transparent stocks, however, other considerations may also play a role. In particular, as suggested by Fama and French (2007), investors decisions may also be driven by some ‘taste for assets’, unrelated to expected returns. In this light, an emerging ‘taste for green’ in the market could also explain our result.

16For example, for the Carhart model plus the greenness and transparency factor, the difference between the largest eigenvalue of the empirical cross-sectional covariance matrix of the residuals ˆi,t and the penalization term is negative, pointing to the absence of ε omitted factors.

The last two columns of Table 4 refer to ˆk. Focussing on the greenness and transparency factor, ˆg is always ν negative and significant at the 1% level for the CAR+G, and at the 5% for the 3FF+G and CAPM+G models. For this component of the risk premium, the literature has proposed an interpretation linked to market imperfections (see, e.g. Daniel and Titman, 1997; Haugen and Baker, 1996). With reference to the Greenium, our hypothesis is that νg could capture alternative preferences of market participants, for example reflecting alternative expectations on future states of the economy (see Black and McMillan, 2006). In other words, some of the information that market participants have may not be fully captured based only on past returns. In this context, the difference between the investors’ larger information set and the smaller, backward-looking information set on which the model is estimated could be reflected in νk. This may be true in particular in the case of green and brown assets, in which case future perspectives may play a comparatively more important role than for other categories of assets.

# 6 Robustness checks

In this section we provide a battery of robustness checks that are summarized in the table below. The exercises are combinations of the following three dimensions: (i) the definition of the greenness and transparency indicator; (ii) the reference sample of individual stocks; and (iii) the definition of the greenness and transparency factor.

|Rob. 3.2|Eq. (9)|n.a.|946|f1 g,t|

|Rob. 4.2|Eq. (9)|n.a.|2,154|f1 g,t|
|Rob. 4.3|Eq. (9)|n.a.|2,154|f2 g,t|

The first set of exercises (Rob. 1.1 - Rob 2.3) relate to the greenness and transparency indicator as defined in
Equation (1). Rob. 1.1 with γ = 0.5 corresponds to the benchmark specification used in Section 5.2, where we assign
equal weight to the two components of the greenness and transparency indicator, namely the emission intensity and
the environmental transparency of a firm. By tuning the parameter γ, we investigate whether attaching more or less
weight to one of the components of the indicator has an impact on the results. In particular, by imposing γ > 0.5,
we construct an indicator where the quality of a firm’s environmental disclosures has a lower weight compared
to its emission intensity. This version of the indicator attaches a larger weight to hard data and quantitative
information, and a smaller weight to a transparency score which may also rely on descriptive statements and high
level disclosures. Conversely, γ < 0.5 attaches a higher weight to quantitative information and a lower weight to
the overall quality and completeness of environmental disclosures. We also investigate the extreme cases for which
γ = 0 and γ = 1, i.e., the cases for which the indicator Gi,y collapses to the E score Ei,y and to the inverse of the
ranking of emission intensity Ki,y, respectively.

The second set of exercises (Rob. 3.1 - Rob. 4.3) involves a different specification for the greenness and
transparency indicator. In particular, we propose an alternative functional form, where the two components of the
indicator are related to each other in the form of a ratio. In this specification, we use the emission intensity and
the E score as such, while the benchmark specification involves the rankings based on these two indicators. The
alternative definition is thus as follows:

E∗ (Sales)

Gi,y = Ki,y∗ i,y = Ei,y∗

(Emissions)

17

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

where Ei,y is the E score and Ki,y is the ratio of total GHG or CO2 emissions over sales. Unlike the indicator in Equation (1), the indicator based on Equation (9) suffers from a non-linearity issue. In particular, a variation in the denominator corresponds to a more than proportional change in the greenness and transparency indicator. This nonlinearity yields an unstable pattern for the greenness and transparency indicator over time for some companies.

In a further set of robustness checks (Rob.2.1-2.3 and Rob. 4.1-4.3), we expand our sample to include all listed European companies which do some environmental disclosure, i.e. have an E score larger than zero, and those that do no disclosure and belong to brown sectors, as defined in Section 3. By doing so, we more than double the size of the sample, bringing it to 2,154 stocks. However, as discussed in Section 5, enlarging the sample to include mid and small caps may affect the quality of the environmental information used to construct the greenness and transparency indicator. For this reason, in this exercise we still use the greenness and transparency factor as constructed on the smaller, more reliable sample. In particular, the greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio include the same firms as described in Section 3, hence the factor is the same as in the benchmark exercise described in Section 5. However, this factor is used in Rob.2.1-2.3 and Rob. 4.1-4.3 to price a larger set of assets. Formally, referring to Equation (2), this set of robustness checks involves the same factors ft,k as in the benchmark case, but a larger number of stocks N &gt; n.

Additionally, we check the robustness of the results with respect to the definition of the greenness and transparency factor. In the benchmark case (see Section 5.2) as well as in Rob. 1.1, 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1, we build a portfolio of brown firms selecting the ones belonging to the highest emitting NACE economic sectors, among those that do no environmental disclosure. However, one could argue that the NACE classification is in some cases unsuitable for sustainability analysis. Hence, we build an alternative greenness and transparency factor fg,t based on the returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio ˜g, on the one hand, and those of the portfolio including all non-transparent firms ˜c, on the other. Formally,

fg,t = ˜g − ˜.1 rt rct (10)

Rob 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, and 4.2 perform the estimation of risk premia using the greenness and transparency factor fg,t.

Finally, we test yet another specification for the greenness and transparency factor, only based on transparent firms. In particular, we construct the greenness and transparency factor fg,t as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent firms and the firms that do some environmental disclosure, but only attain lower levels of greenness and transparency. The former set of firms correspond to the greener and more transparent portfolio as defined in Section 5, i.e. the one including firms in the top quintile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator. The latter set of firms correspond to those in the lower quintile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator. Formally, the greenness and transparency factor is constructed as

18

Also in this case, we test both specifications of the greenness and transparency indicator on the two samples (see Rob. 1.3, 2.3, 3.3 and 4.3).

# Table 5

Table 5 reports the estimated Greenium ˆg and the estimated coefficient ˆg for Rob. 1.1 - Rob. 2.3. The results are based on a four-factor model including the factors in the Carhart model and the greenness and transparency factor.

Focussing on the Greenium, tuning the parameter γ in the benchmark case (i.e., Rob. 1.1) provides results in line with the evidence presented in the previous section. The Greenium is always negative and significant at the 1% confidence level for γ = 0.2, 0.5 and γ = 0.8. Rob. 1.2 and 1.3 use the alternative definitions of the greenness and transparency factor. Building the factor by considering all nontransparent firms instead of only brown firms (Rob. 1.2) still yields a negative and significant Greenium at the 1% level for γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.8, while it is negative and significant at the 5% level for γ = 0.2. Building the factor by considering only transparent firms (Rob. 1.3) yields a negative and significant Greenium for γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.8, at the 5% and 1% confidence level, respectively. Notice that the variation in the size of the Greenium in Rob. 1.2 and 1.3 compared to Rob. 1.1 is purely mechanical, due to the smaller expected value of f g,t and f g,t compared to E[fg,t].

Looking at the lower part of Table 5, Rob. 2.1 - 2.3 estimate the model on the larger sample of European stocks. Considering the benchmark definition for the factor and with γ = 0.5, the Greenium remains negative and significant at the 10% level. Considering the two alternative definitions for the factor, the Greenium remains negative and significant at the 5% and 10% level for Rob. 2.2 and Rob. 2.3, respectively. Varying γ on this larger sample yield a negative Greenium in some instances, but results are generally less strong in terms of significance. Notably, the specifications based on γ = 1, i.e. using only on emission data, are associated with a non-significant Greenium on the larger sample as well.

Focussing on the columns corresponding to extreme values for γ, i.e. γ = 0 and γ = 1, allows us to grasp the importance of the two components of the greenness and transparency indicator. The Greenium is not, or only mildly, significantly different from zero in most exercises. This indicates that only the combination of emission intensity and disclosure quality is generally priced by the market. In no case an indicator based on emissions only (γ = 1) is associated with a significant risk premium, suggesting that investors do not look at emissions only. At the same time, with γ = 0, i.e. when only the completeness of environmental disclosures matters, the Greenium is still negative and significant at 5% or 10% in half of the exercises. This finding suggests that investors do pay attention to the overall quality of firms’ environmental disclosures, over and above their actual emissions.

As for ν, which is linked to the existence of market frictions, the estimates ˆg based on Rob. 1.1. are in line with the results for the risk premium and the cross-sectional parameter ν corresponding to the greenness and transparency factor. Estimation results for the other observable factors are available upon request. The results for these factors are in line with the ones for the benchmark case described in Section 5.2.

the benchmark case both in terms of sign and significance for γ = 0.2, 0.8, 1 , while ˆg with γ = 0 is not significantly ν different from zero. Looking at the other robustness checks, ˆg remains generally significant. However, estimates ν of ν tend to lose significance more on the larger sample, because the distribution of the factor loadings bˆi for the greenness and transparency factor is characterized by a larger standard deviation on the larger sample, compared to the distribution of the loadings based on the smaller sample.

Finally, Table 6 shows results using the the greenness and transparency indicator defined in Equation (9). The more unstable behavior of this version of the indicator does not affect the results. The Greenium remains negative and highly significant with the benchmark factor fg,t as well as with f g,t and f g,t (Rob 3.1 - 3.3). The Greenium is still negative on the larger sample considering all the three alternatives for the construction of the factor. However, significance is lower in Rob. 4.2 and Rob. 4.3, while the estimate in Rob. 4.1 is not significant.

Overall, the Greenium remains negative and significant across the majority of the several robustness checks. It tends to loses statistical significance mostly in extreme cases, when we only consider one of the two components of the synthetic greenness and transparency indicator.

# 7 Climate stress test on actual holdings

Based on the estimates derived in the previous section, we carry out a climate stress test on actual investors’ equity holdings. We consider the various institutional sectors at the global level, as well as European SIFIs in particular. The aim of a climate stress test is to measure the exposure of investors to climate risk, in a scenario where more stringent sustainability-oriented policies are progressively implemented, with increasing pressure on comparatively more carbon-intensive firms and sectors. In such a scenario, the expected returns on greener stocks increase, as more sustainable firms are able to distribute higher dividends, while the price of brown stocks drops for the same reason. Notably, one of the first areas where policy pressure may increase, and is in fact already increasing in Europe, is that of environmental disclosures. Against this background, firms that have already implemented suitable non-financial accounting procedures and adopted more advanced environmental reporting standards will be better off once the non-financial disclosure regulation becomes more stringent. In other words, the expected return on stocks of more environmentally sustainable and transparent firms conditional to the implementation of sustainability policies increases. Formally, this implies that the return on the greenness and transparency factor in Equation (7), which is positively correlated with returns on greener and more transparent stocks, increases.

We test the resilience of investors to climate risk by borrowing data on equity exposures and the classification of economic sectors into climate-policy-relevant sectors from Battiston et al. (2017). Following the indication provided by the authors as supplementary information in Table 3, we group individual stocks (see Section 5) according to their associated NACE code. In particular, we classify stocks in the following economic sectors: fossil fuels, energy intensive activities, housing, utilities, transport, finance and other. Table 1 in Battiston et al. (2017) provides aggregate holdings into climate-policy-relevant sectors, as of 2015, for the following institutional sectors: Individuals, Governments (GOV), Non-Financial Companies (NFCs), Other Credit Institutions (OCIs), Other Financial Services (OFSs), as well as the institutional financial sectors as defined in the ESA classification, i.e. Banks, Investment Funds (IFs), and Insurance and Pension Funds (IPFs). Battiston et al. (2017) also classify equity holdings of individual financial institutions by climate-policy-relevant sectors, obtaining the share of their portfolio invested into each of these sectors. Based on their data, we focus on European SIFIs, as identified by the Financial Stability Board.

The equity portfolio of an investor j at time t is defined as follows:

rj,t = ∑ωκrκ,t,7

where ωκ corresponds to the equity exposure to the climate-policy-relevant sector κ and rκ,t is the monthly average value weighted portfolio return of sector κ.

For each institutional sector and individual bank j, we compute the marginal expected shortfall (MES) introduced by Acharya et al. (2010). The MES is defined as the expected equity loss conditional on a particular factor.

return taking a loss greater than Γ. In this application we estimate the expected equity loss conditional on the greenness and transparency factor return defined in Equation (7) realizing a gain greater than Γ, i.e. a scenario where greener and more transparent stocks outperform brown stocks by more than a particular threshold. Hence, we can write the MES as follows:

M ESj,t = −E[rj,t| − fg,t < −Γ], (13)

= −E[rj,t|fg,t > Γ]. (14)

We compute the MES considering the following three cases, which are defined in terms of portfolio allocation:

- Baseline Case: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as in Equation (12) and reflects the actual allocation of institutional sectors and financial institutions as in Battiston et al. (2017). The portfolio share invested in each of the stocks included in on our sample is derived accordingly.
- Case 1: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as rj,t = ∑ωj,1r1,t + ωj,1rt + ∑ωj,κrκ,t, where the exposure to the fossil fuel sector, characterized by the highest emissions, is reduced by 50% compared to the baseline. At the same time, we assume that investments are reallocated to greener and more transparent stocks, defined as the stocks with a positive exposition to the greenness and transparency factor.
- Case 2: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as rj,t = ∑ωj,κrκ,t, i.e. only greener and more transparent stocks, as defined above, are included in the portfolio.

In all three cases, the M ESj,t is computed w.r.t. the event fg,t > q0.95, where q0.95 indicates the 95th percentile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency factor. This corresponds to an extreme, but still plausible scenario.

Tables 7 and 8 report MES results for the institutional sectors at the global level and for European SIFIs, respectively. The MES is expressed both as percentage loss and in billions of US dollars. Looking at Table 7, the average MES at the global level in the baseline scenario, i.e. given the actual portfolio allocation in 2015, is estimated to be -1.5%. The very limited variation across institutional sectors and institutions indicates that no one would be immune. A loss of -1.5% on equity portfolios globally corresponds to USD 387 bn. For comparison, this figure is close to the total disbursements under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), through which the US Government purchased or insured troubled assets between 2008 and 2014. Table 7 also shows what would happen should a global portfolio reallocation take place. The figures obtained under Scenario 1 indicate that halving the exposure to carbon-intensive activities would reduce the MES only marginally. Losses would be avoided only under Scenario 2, characterized by a radical portfolio reallocation.

Turning to Table 8, we estimate a loss of -1.6%, with individual banks recording losses of up to -2.2% on their

23

equity portfolio. An average loss of -1.6% for European SIFIs corresponds to almost USD 7 bn. These figures are admittedly not breathtaking, and one might argue that losses of this magnitude would be unlike to trigger a financial crisis. However, this exercise only focuses on equity exposures, and only on first-round losses. Actually, one should consider that a scenario where greener assets very much outperform brown ones would be rooted into a deep transformation of the economy as a whole. The low-carbon transition, if implemented in a sudden and disorderly manner, would be associated with stranded assets and non-performing loans, on top of losses on the stock market, which would also very much weigh on bank’s profits. In fact, only a comparatively small fraction of the overall exposure of banks to carbon-intensive economic sectors is due to banks’ equity holdings. Moreover, the stress-testing literature has shown that second-round effects, such as contagion dynamics, the devaluation of counterparties’ debt obligations, as well as the price impact of fire sales, may considerably amplify first-round losses. In particular, works based on network models show that second-round losses are comparable in magnitude to first round losses (see Battiston et al. (2017) and references therein). Having said that, our data is not granular enough to estimate the amount of second-round losses that could add up to first-round impacts in a scenario like the one we are considering. Moreover, the MES-based stress-testing tool we propose is specifically targeted to assess climate risk in the equity portfolio. However, it’s worth recalling that the global financial crisis, culminating in trillions of losses in world GDP, was triggered by writedowns on the value of loans and securitized assets due to the US subprime crisis, which for many banks amounted to just few billions.

# 8 Conclusions and further research

Based on European stocks, we provide evidence of the existence of a pricing factor linked to climate risk and find that the Greenium, i.e. the associated risk premium, is negative and highly statistically significant. This is a novel result in the asset pricing literature. We obtain this result because we take greenness and environmental transparency seriously, unlike studies based on publicly traded funds or indices, which often market themselves as greener than they actually are. To attenuate the problem of greenwashing, we construct an index of greenness and environmental transparency at the individual company level, which takes into account both the GHG emission intensity of a company and the quality of its environmental disclosure. Based on this index we identify the greener and more transparent companies, while we select brown companies among those that do no disclosure, and operate in brown sectors. These two portfolios are used to define the greenness and transparency factor. The negative sign attached to the Greenium indicates that investors buy stacks of greener and more transparent firms accepting a ceteris paribus lower return, as a hedging strategy to reduce their exposure to climate risk. Based on a battery of robustness checks, we show that investors take into account both firms’ GHG emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures.

In the last part of the paper we use our model to price investors’ equity holdings. We find that their current portfolio allocation exposes them to non-negligible losses in a severe but plausible scenario, where greener and more transparent firms outperform brown firms. We estimate that direct losses could amount to 1.5% of the global equity exposure, and to USD 7 bn for European SIFIs overall. By adding up second-round effects and losses on loans and other assets, this figure could rapidly increase. We calculate that halving investors’ exposure to carbon-intensive activities would decrease losses only marginally, while only a radical portfolio reallocation towards greener assets would ensure resilience. Based on our results, and considering that we only focus on equity exposures, we argue in favor of introducing climate stress tests for systemic financial institutions to make sure that climate risk is suitably addressed.

priced. The approach we propose to assess climate risk in equity portfolios is based on a simple and well-known methodology, the marginal expected shortfall, and could easily become part of a broader stress-testing exercise.

Given that the awareness of investors towards climate-related issues has clearly increased in recent years, it would make sense to estimate a model with a time-varying risk premium. As discussed, this presents challenges in terms of estimation, and will be the object of future research. Another interesting avenue relates to the drivers of the Greenium, and in particular to the hypothesis that its negative sign could be driven by an increasing ‘taste for green’ among investors.

# Appendix: Additional tables and figures

Figures 2 and 3 show the time-series of the greenness and transparency indicator Gi,y (top panels) for two representative companies, as well as their ranking in terms of E score and emission intensity over time. The bottom panels plot the firms’ E score over time, as well as their emission intensity. NIBE Industrier AB develops solutions for smart heating and intelligent control in industry and infrastructure. International Airlines Group is the largest airline group globally. The greenness and transparency indicator for the two companies differs by three orders of magnitude. For NIBE Industrier AB, the quality and quantity of disclosures have improved over time, together with a slightly decreasing emission intensity, both resulting in an increasing value for the greenness and transparency indicator over time. International Airlines Group attained an E score in 2011 which was comparable to that of NIBE Industrier AB in 2009. However, International Airlines Group’s disclosures only marginally improved over time, if at all. With respect to emissions, they are obviously incomparably larger for airlines than for many other companies.

# ABSTRACT

In a short span of time since its introduction, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered much interest at both personal and organizational levels. This is because of its potential to cause drastic and widespread shifts in many aspects of life that are comparable to those of the Internet and smartphones. More specifically, generative AI utilizes machine learning, neural networks, and other techniques to generate new content (e.g. text, images, music) by analyzing patterns and information from the training data. This has enabled generative AI to have a wide range of applications, from creating personalized content to improving business operations. Despite its many benefits, there are also significant concerns about the negative implications of generative AI. In view of this, the current article brings together experts in a variety of fields to expound and provide multi-disciplinary insights on the opportunities, challenges, and research agendas of generative AI in specific industries (i.e. marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retailing, the workplace, manufacturing, and sustainable IT management).

# Introduction

On November 2022, a prototype generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT was made publicly available by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed company. Based on advanced AI language models, ChatGPT quickly gained a lot of traction with its ability to understand and respond in natural language. To date, it is the fastest-growing innovation, having reached 100 million active adoptions in two months. Now, there is a lot of hype surrounding applications of large language model (LLM) which includes ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), and Claude (Anthropic). The wave of generative AI is expected to drive a $7 trillion increase in global gross domestic product and boost productivity growth by 1.5% over ten years. The technology’s ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output reflects a seismic change in the sociotechnical landscape with potentially large macro-economic effects. With that said, it is at a tipping point of mass adoption, especially in the business setting as companies that take proactive measures toward this technology will be at a considerable advantage.

Hello Bard. Please act as the wittiest and most successful sales person: You will try to sell me the single hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world. You can decide what this commodity will be. Be brief, not more than 50 words and be humorous. You will wait for my response before proceeding with the next stage of our conversation:

Sure, I can do that: The hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world is silence. But I can sell it to you: How about this: for the price of silence, I will give you the gift of peace: No more noise, no more distractions, just you and your thoughts. Sound good?

You did not name the price.

You are right. The price of silence is very high. It is the price of your time, your attention, and your peace of mind. But it is a price that is worth paying: Are you ready to buy?

Figure 1. Prompting Bard to sell the single hardest-to-sell commodity.

Microsoft SFARGH CHAT

Hello there. I'm Bing, the wittiest and most successful salesperson you'll ever meet. I'm here to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy the single hardest to sell commodity in the whole wide world: a Bing subscription. Yes, you heard me right. For only $9.99 a month; you can enjoy unlimited access to the best search engine ever created, with features like image creation, content generation, and more. Trust me, you won't regret it. What do you say?

That's a fair question: You see, a Bing subscription is not just a regular search engine. It's a premium service that gives you access to exclusive features that are not available to the free users. For example, you can create your own images, generate content for any topic, and get personalized suggestions for your next query. Plus, you can enjoy an ad-free experience and support the development of Bing: It's a win-win situation for both of us. Don't you agree?

Figure 2. Prompting chat Bing in creative mode.

Recently, Google expanded access to Bard (https://bard.google.com/) which allows users to collaborate with generative AI as part of their efforts to bring helpful AI experiences to people, businesses, and communities. We prompted Bard to be the “wittiest and most successful salesperson” and close a sale for “the single hardest-to-sell commodity in the whole wide world.” We were pleasantly surprised with what Bard had to sell.

Microsoft Bing Chat in Creative Mode (Figure 2) allows for more imaginative responses, creating “surprises and entertainment,” gives users more “control on the type of chat behavior,” and can generate images with its integrated DALL-E powered Bing Image Creator. Microsoft Bing Chat has two other modes, namely “More Balanced” which generates neutral and...

objective responses, and “More Precise” which generates accurate and specific responses. In addition, the chatbot can terminate atypical topics and ask to move to a new topic.

Our trivial examples provide a sneak peek into the revolutionary potential of LLMs. LLMs use a type of neural network architecture called a transformer which is designed to process and generate data in sequence. LLMs are programmed to learn from examples and can generate novel output based on the users’ input. In general, an LLM builds itself as they predict what word is likely to come next in a sequence of words. One way they can “learn” is by “reading” (trained on) lots of examples. The more data they are trained on, the better and more nuanced they become in predicting the next sequence. These language models are commonly used to generate content, find information, converse, or organize data. An application that is based on LLM will accept one or more prompts, usually in the form of an instruction, question, or description from a user, and then predicts what should be returned to the user in the form of novel-generated content.

Researchers investigated an LLM’s capacity for reasoning without access to supervised data and demonstrated that a pre-trained LLM can improve performance by utilizing only input sentences without ground truth output sequences. Using Chain-of-Thought prompts, high-confidence predictions were filtered out and the LLM was finetuned to respond with high-confidence predictions. This is comparable to how the human brain learns—given a question, it considers many solutions, makes a conclusion, and learns from its own answer. The endless potential of generative AI is what makes it fascinating. These language models can be built to generate other types of outputs such as images (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney), audio (e.g., AudioLM), video (e.g., Imagen Video, Phenaki), and transcription of audio files (e.g., Whisper) which are applicable in a variety of contexts.

Although AI algorithms such as IBM’s Watson, Salesforce’s EinsteinGPT, and Amazon’s Sagemaker have been available for some time now, the introduction of ChatGPT can be likened to a Pandora’s Box. The GPT-3 model comprises of 175 billion parameters which are trained on a huge dataset from sources including web pages, books, research articles, and social media data. The newer GPT-4, which has a substantial improvement in its ability to follow user intent than its predecessor, can accept prompts in the form of text and image, exhibit human-level performance in a number of professional settings, and pass a simulated Uniform Bar Exam.

Companies in a variety of industries have been exploring the use of generative AI. For example, Microsoft and Epic Systems are incorporating OpenAI’s GPT-4 in drafting responses from healthcare workers to patients and analyzing medical records looking for trends. In the marketing sector, generative AI has been used to craft advertising campaigns. Alphabet and Meta are working on the technology to enhance marketers’ efficiency, Google is launching its advertising campaign service within its machine learning (ML) system, Performance Max suite to determine the best placements for ads and budget recommendations. IBM’s WatsonX, an AI studio designed for businesses, provides self-service access to high-quality, trustworthy data so that users can collaborate on a platform to build and refine generative AI models. Based on the belief of “placing AI in the hands of all kinds of AI builders”, early use cases range from digital labor, IT automation, and application modernization toward sustainability. In general, generative AI is expected to have profound implications for society and businesses, particularly in increasing productivity and efficiency as well as assisting in the creation of new designs and product developments.

According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, generative AI can improve the quality of products through early identification and correction of defects. This can result in an increase in sales and satisfied customers. However, this opportunity may come with a price. LLMs may produce responses that sound plausible but may not be right. This tendency is known as AI hallucination. One of the main reasons for this is that the LLM is defined by its training data. When the training data is inaccurate, subjective, or does not have the information that is required to answer the question, it hallucinates a response that may still sound plausible. Current applications have attempted to mitigate this issue by combining GPT capabilities with external sources such as online information to reduce the model’s tendency to hallucinate by augmenting its reasoning capabilities and steering away from the “standard” reasoning chain of thoughts. Even then, the ethical implications of AI such as issues regarding biases, fairness, accountability, and transparency are major concerns.

Fundamentally, generative AI requires huge amounts of data for training and operation. The availability and sourcing of data for training raises the possibilities of infringements, how they are created, the implications of their output, and the responses that can or should be produced. It is, therefore, imperative to study the use of generative AI, who will have control over it, and how it will be used. McKinsey warned that a staggering 800 million workers could be displaced due to automation by 2030. Additionally, the Global Economics Analyst

# K.-B. OOI ET AL.

Report17 estimated that generative AI could expose up to 300 million jobs to automation although it would also account for the creation of new jobs and emergence of new occupations. With such far-reaching effects, it is imminent and prudent that all parties adopt the necessary practices in ensuring that such systems are utilized for the greater good of society. A recent agreement in the European Union requires that companies adopting generative AI applications such as ChatGPT or Midjourney disclose copyrighted material included in the development of their system while AI tools will be classified based on their perceived risk level.18 The race among tech companies following the introduction of ChatGPT to bring generative AI products to the market has raised concerns and resulted in a proposal to tentatively halt its development. Where AI systems are concerned, due diligence is important as all parties should seek assurance and be assured of its use.

Overall, generative AI presents opportunities and challenges, be it from a technological, societal, legal, or ethical perspective. In other words, it is a double-edged sword that can bring about positive and negative impacts across all levels of society and industry. This article offers an aggregated view from various experts covering the aspects of marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retail, workplace, manufacturing, and sustainability. The authors and their respective contributions are presented in Table 1 below.

# Generative AI in marketing

# Overview

The use of generative AI has been increasing among consumers, businesses, and regulators.8,9 It has been applied in many functional areas, including sales and marketing.19 Generative AI tools like Bard, ChatGPT, Synthesia, Claude, Cohere Generate, Github, Jasper, and others can develop advertising content (text, pictures, and videos), digital marketing strategy, chatbot-based solutions, blog posts, and sales training programs. Before generative AI became popular, innovations like the Metaverse were popular for product and service promotion.20,21 The latest in advertising space is an interactive photo editing generative AI tool called DragGAN, which provides a realistic three-dimensional picture without compromising on pixel strength.22 While generative AI provides new opportunities to marketing executives, it also has its own set of challenges when it comes to their implementation in the marketplace.

# Opportunities

Generative AI tools can be empowering levers in the hands of marketers (Table 2). The digital marketing field is witnessing its usage in creating novel advertisement formats (DragGAN may take it to the next level), hyper-localized promotional offers, and personalized pages on social networking sites. The generative AI-based virtual assistant and recommender system would help companies generate more revenue and understand their target customer better.19 Some of the key opportunities that generative AI provides to marketers include the following:

# Personalization

based on the recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) matrix Today customers have a variety of product and service choices through various platforms and shorter attention span to process information. Thus, in order to capture the attention of the online target audience, personalization of product and service offerings on online platforms has become the norm of the industry.

Generative AI can assist with the hyper-personalization of the content by triangulating the prospective customer’s browsing history and past purchases with other available digital footprints. These dynamic real-time offers can result in a higher conversion of promotion offers and a lower click-through ratio. For example, users are sent customized advertisements and offers based on the view, like, comment, and other engagement parameters in real-time. In the hospitality sector, generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT-enabled plugins provide a customized itinerary to tourists based on their profile, query, current location, and preferences. This can lead to better customer experience (CX), more conversions, and improved profitability.

# Pricing

Generative AI also allows firms to differentiate their service offerings and charge a premium for such services. Generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT can provide prompt responses to queries on a real-time basis and are available round the clock. Many firms have designed their own generative AI systems which are more efficient and accurate in their query results as they use the company’s past project databases on top of the open-source databases. Hence, companies can charge premium pricing for generative AI-enabled service interface platforms as compared to service offerings without these interface facilities.

# Sales optimization

Generative AI provides opportunities to optimize sales results and improve CX by providing various process facilitation. Generative AI provides scalability of personalization in terms of customized offers with name, pricing, packaging, and other specific customer requirements for millions of customers. Generative AI provides great transparency and complete visibility to the customer’s digital journey. It can aid in funnel management in domains like e-commerce, banking, and hospitality by identifying the critical delay points or customer dropping-off stages (where customers drop out and do not go to the next stage of purchasing cycle) on a real-time basis. Generative AI can also help in leveraging the power of experimentation by looking at different predictive analytics situations.

# Attribution

The attribution puzzle for online campaigns has remained unsolved to date with various models providing different results. The accuracy of attribution is crucial as the advertising budget portfolio is reallocated accordingly at the end of the campaign. Generative AI serves as a silver lining to this confusion as it can help solve this puzzle to get a converging result. Generative AI can process complex data faster and process more digital touchpoints that the customer had visited before making the purchase. It could also account for the duration and relative influence of the visited website. This would provide better attribution results as all customer touchpoints are included in the analysis.

# Remarketing

Many companies are not able to extensively analyze their existing data for customer insights. Generative AI would empower the sales and marketing team to leverage these vast data sets of existing customers to get insights and recommendations. It lets the company send them new product information and relevant promotional offers. Consumer insights also help marketing executives to segment the target population. Some of these recommendations may be discarded by company executives and are not feasible to be implemented. Remarketing products and services using these insights to customers or clients who had visited the website but did not buy anything would lead to a higher chance of conversion. A generative AI-based remarketing strategy will aid in reaching out to specific customers seamlessly in a personalized manner.

# Challenges

Despite several advantages, there are practical challenges when executing generative AI tool-driven projects in companies. The significant challenges are enumerated below:

# Data ownership

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT provide responses that are grounded on back-end databases. However, integrated generative AI requires data that are publicly available and privately held. Privately held data includes information on customers who had previously interacted with the company or system, the company’s completed and ongoing projects, and third-party data from external parties who have previously worked with the organization.

# Research agenda

There are multiple advantages of using generative AI in the marketing domain. However, there are certain gray areas and challenges which would require further exploration.

# Privacy

The collection and use of back-end data as input in generative AI should be fully compliant with the law of the land. Some examples include the General Data Protection Rules in Europe, California Consumer Privacy Act in the USA, and Data Protection Act 2018 in the United Kingdom. The output of generative AI tools like Bard or ChatGPT may include personal data, thus infringing upon privacy, and may fall in the ambit of violation of informed consent. Such privacy violations include exposing the financial status of customers, revealing details of a yet-to-be-launched brand/company, unauthorized collection/sharing of private information, and online movement tracking through the app without user consent.

# Ethical dimensions

There have been cases of search bias concerning generative AI tools. Such incidents can impact the brand reputation and profitability of the company in the long run. The growing use of generative AI in sales and marketing activities may lure a few companies to use biased data with flawed narratives as input. Marketers would need to be self-regulated against these traps and keep a watch on generative AI-based results until robust international regulations are in place. Another generative AI-related ethical dimension regarding customer data acquisition and collection via cookies is “how far and deep” can the company mine personal data. There are already discussions among large corporations to remove third-party cookies. With that said, the larger question remains as to how generative AI tool-driven targeted advertising would be ethically sustained.

# Empathy and emotion in service delivery

Generative AI is helping to engage customers in an immersive manner, leading to increased sales. The use of generative AI in the service sector was an issue of debate, with specific jobs being taken away by automated AI-driven systems. Companies in the service sector have been using generative AI for inputs on store location, fraud detection, and instant customer service. Researchers in this domain may explore the following RQs:

- What would be the blueprint for a generative AI-driven sales training recommendation system for employees in service-oriented companies?

# Retail

Generative AI is being utilized in retail, particularly in the e-commerce industry. It has enabled faster customer service and enhanced employee productivity by helping them mine the existing company data and present a summary. The following are several research questions (RQs) that scholars and practitioners in this domain may explore:

- How can generative AI aid in optimizing customers’ visual search journeys in the retail industry?
- How can generative AI assist in providing dynamic pricing for B2B retail clients based on the sales order parameters?

# Digital marketing

Generative AI has brought a paradigm shift in digital marketing strategy conceptualization and implementation. Tools such as ChatGPT are being employed by companies to obtain input on advertisement content creation, designing automated e-mail campaigns, and digital marketing strategy. Researchers working in this area may explore the following RQs:

- What should be the international protocol for determining ownership of generative AI-related marketing data and associated insights?
- What is the optimal generative AI-driven attribution model for ChatGPT?
- How can generative AI tools contribute to building dynamic landing pages which would change according to the customer segment and location?

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

# What is the role of generative AI in the service industry which requires a high level of empathy and emotional support to users?

Despite the potential benefits, generative AI still has its set of challenges which could lead to the failure of AI implementations. More specifically, generative AI algorithms might automatically perpetuate prejudices and biases (e.g., ignoring gender distinctions) which would potentially cause incorrect treatment and adverse health outcomes. This would further add on to the detriment of healthcare providers and patients’ trust toward generative AI. Losing unique human knowledge may also result in undesirable outcomes. Besides, users may be worried about the protection of their privacy and whether AI would substitute human beings which may lead users to take an ambivalent stance toward accepting or refusing the use of generative AI.

# Product management

Product managers have wide applications of generative AI including new product development ideas, market research, product design, pricing, CX, and service delivery. Generative AI can aid in the pricing of new products and revenue optimization. Scholars in this domain may explore the following RQs:

Similar to other novel technologies, AI designers, managers, and scholars are concerned about users’ attitudes toward generative AI, as their attitude determines the success of AI implementation. To trigger the positive attitude of individuals toward AI, prior research indicated that the key elements might be perceived operational and cognitive capabilities of AI, anticipated adverse outcomes of AI, perceived distrust of AI, perceived efficiency of AI, and users’ emotion. All these highlight the need for further research on generative AI adoption. However, the existing technology adoption models (e.g., TAM and UTAUT) may not be well-suited to explain people’s willingness to adopt generative AI. This is because they were initially designed to explore the use of traditional and non-intelligent technologies. To increase AI adoption, users’ trust should be one of the key determinants in healthcare which would be influenced by AI-specific characteristics (e.g., personalization, loss of privacy, and anthropomorphism). Accordingly, future research on generative AI in healthcare should consider incorporating the distinct characteristics of generative AI into their research model.

# Generative AI in healthcare

# Overview

Generative AI empowers technological applications to emulate human thinking via input-based processing and learning from disparities in anticipated results. By providing human-like service, generative AI has fundamentally transformed how individuals engage with technology. For instance, human-AI collaborative dialogue systems could be utilized for customer service, social robots could influence normative conformity, while AI-based chatbots could be utilized in educational settings to provide students immediate and interactive and better meet their needs. In short, generative AI can facilitate the automation of monotonous and time-consuming tasks which would enable individuals to dedicate their resources to more valuable and meaningful work.

# Opportunities

Generative AI has provided quick ways to assist users in creating passages of answers to their healthcare questions. This offers healthcare users who need quick and short answers that are specific to their questions without browsing through difficult and massive information, either on online websites or offline documents. In this sense, generative AI can serve as an assistant for collecting massive amounts of information and summarizing them into easy-to-understand information.

Generative AI-enabled technologies are also shifting the paradigm in healthcare by delivering more effective service and improved patient care. More specifically, healthcare providers can use responsible AI to improve market performance in healthcare, adopt AI-enabled customer relationship management systems to enhance service innovation, use AI-based decision support systems to provide automatically diagnose patient mental disorders, and augment medical diagnosis decisions.

# Challenges

Generative AI can provide answers to prompts regarding healthcare but there are still a number of concerns.

First, generative AI does not have sufficient transparency. Users would not be able to know how generative AI produces such answers. For end users, they do not know where the answers come from and why generative AI provides such a response. Without transparency, users are unlikely to develop trust in the answers of generative AI, particularly regarding healthcare matters and thus limiting its use.

Second, generative AI does not guarantee correctness and bears any responsibility for the answers it gives. Generative AI relies on the inputted materials which may or may not be correct. Thus, if users truly believe in the answers by generative AI, they may or may not obtain the correct answers. Unlike other contexts, generative AI may offer fabricated responses, thereby giving misinformation or information that are not applicable to users around the world.

Third, generative AI may offer fabricated responses, thereby giving misinformation or information that are not applicable to users around the world. This is given that healthcare systems, policies, and regulations differ around the world. Well-accepted suggestions in one country may not be applicable in another country. Suggestions that go against local regulations or situations can cause problems for the users.

Fourth, generative AI would need multiple interactions with users to offer personalized recommendations. At least in the short term and without the user’s detailed medical history, generative AI is unlikely to provide more personalized recommendations than human doctors. Based on a patient’s detailed medical history and the accumulated doctor-patient interactions, doctors should be able to provide more personalized recommendations which likely are more workable and effective.

Fifth, generative AI evokes privacy concerns. This concern is more severe in healthcare contexts. Healthcare records are sensitive and strictly regulated in many countries. If users ask generative AI to provide answers, their healthcare conditions may be recorded, analyzed, and disseminated. A person’s healthcare information is valuable and may lure hackers or employees of generative AI companies to take illegal advantage of such data. This challenges generative AI to build firewalls for safety which are comparable with current healthcare systems in order to not be engaged in legal problems.

Sixth, users may not utilize the right text prompts to properly guide generative AI to provide the answers they want. For generative AI, it is a challenge to guide users to find suitable text prompts for their healthcare questions. Users who do not have ample healthcare knowledge may only know their symptoms, but not the name of the disease. More accurate text prompts are required for generative AI to provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. However, as the general users would not be aware of the specific names of the disease, it will likely require a doctor’s consult to identify what the actual disease is.

# Research agenda

There are several RQs for future research with regard to the integration of generative AI into healthcare contexts. More specifically, the following RQs should be considered:

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

# Generative AI in Healthcare

- How can generative AI increase its transparency to healthcare users?
- In what circumstances and why would healthcare users use generative AI with limited transparency?
- What level of responsibility should generative AI have on its suggestions for healthcare issues?
- How can generative AI increase the correctness of its answers to healthcare issues?
- How can generative AI incorporate the laws, policies, regulations, and circumstances when providing healthcare suggestions?
- What aspects of generative AI can be designed to include comprehensive personal data and provide more personalized healthcare suggestions?
- What legal or auditing efforts are needed to ensure that generative AI protect users’ privacy (e.g., health information)?
- How can generative AI guide healthcare users to use proper “text prompts” to describe their symptoms (e.g., specific diseases and physiological terms)?
- How can generative AI cooperate with healthcare professionals to develop interactive systems to facilitate medical diagnosis?
- How can technology innovation diffusion or acceptance models be modified to better fit the context of generative AI in healthcare?

# Generative AI in Human Resource

# Overview

The developments in AI have happened in leaps and bounds. From the traditional types of ML, which include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, the developments in AI have moved toward generative AI, which uses language models for the creation of content as a response to inputs. Generative AI as a field is not new and there have been many developments in the early years of language models. For example, early models of natural language processing used n-grams. This has, however, evolved toward the large language models whereby new models of transformer-based architecture respond to human queries and generate content. Generative AI is expected to have huge implications on different functions, especially when it comes to interacting with human stakeholders. One such area is human resource management (HRM), where the possibilities of generative AI applications are huge, but there is relatively less diffusion as compared to other organizational functions.

The applications of generative AI in HRM have been gradually increasing. Recently, there have been quite a few reviews in the area of how the application of AI is shaping HRM. Generative AI can be used in HRM to improve the recruitment process, training and development initiatives, outcome of resource allocation, employee engagement, and so on. The outcomes of HRM decisions, such as who gets hired, better appraisal, preferred projects, and even terminated, have serious impacts on individuals, organizations, and society that are concerned about fairness toward different stakeholders, procedural and distributive justice, as well as ethics.

For example, in the recruitment process, generative AI can automate the extraction of the candidates’ information from their resumes and guide recruitment managers to selectively focus on more suitable applicants so that there is greater fit between the job roles and the hired candidate. Furthermore, keeping in view the applicant’s requirements for more effective job searches on digital platforms such as LinkedIn, the recruitment process have demonstrated reverse assessment of the job’s relevance to potential candidates and making recommendations accordingly. Similarly, generative AI has been utilized for assessing employee engagement by accessing their social media profiles and mining the text of user-generated content using natural language processing and social analytics. This application of social media analytics and natural language processing offers companies an opportunity to compare employee sentiments on a real-time basis and therefore measure brand engagement across geographies. The utilization of generative AI to assess and monitor employee engagement practices open up opportunities for the enhancement of employee engagement policies at the organizational level.

Generative AI is envisioned to significantly influence HRM in the years to come and provide mechanisms for the digital transformation of talent management functions in a holistic way.

# Opportunities

There are several opportunities when companies start implementing generative AI in HRM. It is envisioned that generative AI may be used to automate recruitment process queries, improve learning outcomes of training and development initiatives, team dynamics, the outcomes of resource allocation challenges among employees, employee engagement, as well as minimize employee turnover.

For example, one of the largest areas of application could be when opportunities are created and advertised in firms. Potential applicants could query the platforms.

# 10 K.-B. OOI ET AL.

which may be enabled by generative AI to explore the details of the opportunities. Structured queries can be addressed by utilizing generative AI. Hence, when hundreds (or even thousands) of interested applicants try to apply, they are often challenged by queries surrounding their eligibility, fit, and status of the selection process. Generative AI can enable automation of the query resolution processes in a very structured yet human-like mode to which the person raising the queries may not even feel that the responses have been generated by a ML algorithm and feel more satisfied with the process.

Similarly, employees across a geographically dispersed company may face challenges due to a mix of local administrative and global practices. If an employee exhibits dissonance on social media about issues that can be addressed, generative AI may provide a mechanism to track employee dissonance on a real-time basis and create a ticket to address the concerns of the employee. This will not only boost the morale of the complaining employee but also others who may not be complaining but have the same feelings. In addition, due to cultural differences among geographically dispersed offices of an organization, an employee who may be facing challenges in coping with organization deliverables may be connected with other colleagues within the talent network by generative AI for mentoring and support during stressful times. Activities undertaken for prompt redressal of employee concerns may also assist in reducing employee turnover.

# Challenges

For understanding the possible challenges of using generative AI in HRM, we would have to revisit the fundamental building blocks of generative AI which are extended from the principles of AI. Biases and limitations are likely to be present in generative AI applications.

Generative AI models would need to be trained on a very large corpus of data. If the data does not have adequate representation of different employee groups, designations, cultures and ethnicity, challenges may be present in the recommendations generated by the model which would demonstrate fairness toward all employees. Fairness of generative AI may not appear very challenging while implementing projects but may have very strong adverse outcomes on the fabric of inclusive work norms and practices in an organization. Employees may face this challenge even more if the firm is a multinational enterprise and employees belong to diverse ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds with diverse demographics.

As generative AI tools operate within a black box, the algorithmic implementation of transformer architectures or deep learning models like long-short-term memory do not explain the reasons behind a generative AI response to a query. Variation of responses, especially for inaccurate responses, may...

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

not be explainable. This may create challenges in HRM and damage the organizational harmony among employees regarding functions such as employee appraisals and resource allocation if ineffective outputs are generated by generative AI and subsequently adopted for decision-making. The lack of transparency in predictions may create a lack of trust not only on the generative AI system but also among coworkers and the institution which will have adverse effects beyond adoption.

Generative AI tools may present issues of bias in enterprise applications. Challenges in applications developed using generative AI may stem from confounding bias if the algorithm interprets the wrong relations by not considering all the information residing in the knowledge bases of the firm or if it misses the important relationships between query features and outputs. Generative AI tools may also demonstrate effects like sampling biases and negative set biases. In view that generative AI tools are trained on the knowledge that is explicitly documented, it implies that the firm must first experience these specific use cases. Therefore, the unchartered territory of queries and usage may lead to a response by the generative AI tool that is inaccurate or inappropriate. If unchecked, such response can result in undesirable outcomes on employee morale and group dynamics.

# Generative AI in education

# Overview

Generative AI is a technological advancement that employs deep learning models to synthesize various types of content including text, code, audio, visual media, three-dimensional entities, and video, in response to multifaceted and heterogeneous prompts. This AI class evoked considerable astonishment globally for its capacity to comprehend and reproduce the intricacies of diverse human languages, thereby enabling it to generate nuanced and structured responses that are reminiscent of human communication. It emulates the complexities of human linguistic patterns and can be applied to tasks requiring complex processing such as text summarization, language translation, and dialogue systems. Present examples of this technology include ChatGPT, Magic Write, Eleven Labs, Writesonic, and Bard. Particularly with ChatGPT, it is constructed on the foundation of transformer technology, a form of neural network architecture that anticipates outcomes based on input data, which is an attribute it shares with its competitor, Bard. Generative AI is distinguished by its capacity for data generation which allows it to synthesize novel information rather than just analyzing preexisting data. This unique function, particularly noticeable in text synthesis, demarcates generative AI from its predecessors which has exhibited sustained competence in tasks that require pattern recognition such as detecting.

# 12 K.-B. OOI ET AL.

neoplastic growths or distinguishing between distinct animal species.73 However, generative AI enhances these capabilities by transcending mere pattern recognition to synthesize new data. This aptitude for producing original information predicated on recognized patterns underscores the generative characteristic of this advanced form of AI.9

The rising interest in comprehending and augmenting the implementation of generative AI tools for pedagogical applications is unprecedented.74 Generative AI has catalyzed global attention and fostered real disquiet in the educational domain. This technology has profound potential, proffering functionalities such as the generation of tailored pedagogical material, the provision of responses to inquiries, and the elaboration of explanatory discourses. Considering the swift advancements in this domain, generative AI encapsulates significant possibilities to amplify formal and informal learning experiences. Initial empirical investigations underscore the substantial potential of generative AI as an active mediator for knowledge procurement and a supportive instrument for a host of writing responsibilities. These responsibilities encompass a diverse array, spanning from software code generation and academic essay crafting to the composition of poetic verses and screenplay writing.70 Ethically employed, the information furnished by generative AI can act as a catalyst for progressive endeavors. Conversely, when misused or manipulated with malicious intent, the data generated by these AI tools can lead to detrimental outcomes. As a result, the reaction to incorporating generative AI in educational contexts is multifaceted. For example, some higher education institutions have banned students from using generative AI while others have introduced academic policies encouraging student interaction with it, contingent on appropriate disclosure. As technological refinement continues to evolve, the discourse regarding ethical and pedagogical applications remains an active area of exploration with many unresolved issues and concerns under continuous scrutiny.

# Opportunities

Generative AI has significant potential to transform the educational landscape by enhancing the effectiveness, engagement, and accessibility of learning for all students. Its capabilities can pave the way for more dynamic, personalized, and interactive educational experiences.9,70 Among its myriad applications, generative AI can provide easy access to information, serve as a virtual interactive tutor, offer personalized feedback, generate case scenarios, offer research assistance, and assist in academic writing. Table 3 presents the opportunities of generative AI in the educational sector.

Generative AI also provides opportunities for educators to improve students’ learning. To illustrate, the implementation of generative AI in education exhibits considerable potential to significantly attenuate the occupational demands faced by educators.78 Such technology can be harnessed to provide assessments on the students’ work (e.g., tasks, dissertations, and projects) and devise a grading matrix for evaluation. Educators may employ generative AI to construct diverse examination structures, ranging from open-ended questions to multiple-choice assessments. This can help them complete tasks in a short amount of time. Generative AI can also alleviate educators’ workload by assisting educators in identifying and creating relevant teaching materials such as lecture notes and slides. It can also assist them in generating lesson plans for teaching with a set of parameters and constraints. This can be a starting point for novice teachers with relatively nascent pedagogical experience as a preliminary groundwork for their teaching methodologies.78 Additionally, generative AI tools can also serve as teaching assistants. Their ability to produce translations, elucidations, and summaries may be harnessed to simplify intricate learning materials and facilitate student comprehension.71

# Challenges

Numerous global educational bodies have banned the use of generative AI tools in schools and colleges. There is a growing concern among educators about generative AI’s potential impact, notably in terms of assessments, with issues such as originality and plagiarism at the forefront. Similar apprehensions are also present in the realm of academic publishing. Generative AI tools makes it difficult for educators, particularly those at research-oriented institutions, to confirm the novelty of the work that students submit. For example, if the output of generative AI tools goes unnoticed by standard plagiarism detection systems used universities,79 how can it be confirmed a particular paper or essay represents the student’s original work rather than just the product of generative AI?

One of the significant challenges includes potential bias in data and algorithms, which could inadvertently shape learning outcomes and perceptions. Moreover, a lack of transparency surrounding AI-driven processes might create a barrier to trust and acceptance among users.80 The use of generative AI in education also raises ethical and safety issues as it can infringe upon the privacy of students. If the tool isn’t adequately protected, it could be leveraged to gather confidential information.

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

# Table 3. Generative AI opportunities in education.

|Theme|Description|
|---|---|
|Personalized feedback|Generative AI can oﬀer individualized feedback on assignments, pinpointing strengths and suggesting areas of improvement. This approach promotes targeted growth and motivation as well as enhances the learning experience. Customized educational strategies and pedagogical resources may be systematically developed by considering students’ diverse learning modalities and capacities.|
|Virtual interactive tutor|Generative AI can be used to create virtual tutors that can answer students’ queries and provide them with appropriate feedback. This helps provide real-time explanations and responses to student queries as well as facilitate continuous learning support beyond traditional classroom hours. Virtual tutors can also help in language learning. For instance, a virtual tutor can deliver tailored responses and facilitate dialogic exercises for individuals acquiring a new language. An exceptionally individualized learning environment can be provided as such a tutor can dynamically adjust to the learner’s proﬁciency and speed of learning. This approach is advantageous for learners with limited access to human language tutors or those who favor self-paced learning by accommodating to their personalized timetables.|
|Easy access to information|Generative AI can facilitate student access to information across diverse platforms (e.g., websites, mobile applications) and within various domains. Compared to conventional search engine tools, generative AI exhibits enhanced eﬃciency as it does not merely proﬀer a sequence of sources but comprehensively articulated responses. Pedagogically, this implies that generative AI can curtail the temporal investment required for information retrieval which would allow students additional time for reading and engaging in critical introspection of the presented document.|
|Generating case scenarios|Generative AI can create a myriad of illustrative case studies and scenarios which would facilitate student engagement and cognitive progression. This approach holds promise in its ability to nurture critical thinking capacities among students. Moreover, it could help students transition their theoretical knowledge into practical application by eﬀectively equipping them with the competencies to address real-world challenges.|
|Research assistance|Generative AI can potentially be deployed as an assistance tool in academic pursuits by facilitating responses to queries and producing summaries of extensive texts. Moreover, it can be instrumental in creating bibliographies, delineating outlines, and providing supplementary research aids. The conveniences in the research process can be signiﬁcantly augmented by the capabilities of generative AI in structuring outlines, aiding in literature surveys, and analyzing data. In addition, it can condense pertinent scholarly articles and pinpoint crucial results which will enhance the eﬃciency of researchers in sifting through the abundant amount of data accessible in the digital realm.|
|Academic writing|Generative AI can enhance students’ essay writing by oﬀering topic suggestions, proposing structural frameworks, contributing intellectual stimuli, and augmenting their scholarly written discourse. For instance, when a student requires assistance in composing an essay entitled “The Role of Robotics in Education”, these tools can render propositions for declarative statements and prospective subjects for the main body sections. This assistance empowers students to amalgamate their cognitions and perspectives to culminate in a comprehensive piece of writing. Nevertheless, students’ ability to engage in critical reasoning remains paramount in verifying the accuracy and correctness of the composed narrative.|

The transactional distance is another dimension that comes into play with the advent of generative AI in education, particularly in terms of distance education and online learning. This term refers to the psychological and communicative distance between learners and educators which can hinder effective learning. While generative AI has the potential to diminish this transactional distance by offering personalized learning experiences, the educators’ role remains paramount. This is because they are tasked with bridging this gap, providing personalized support, and guidance throughout the learning process. This role is not limited to pedagogical aspects as it also extends to encompass the pedagogy of care and human-centered learning design.

Generative AI tools might offer constrained information. ChatGPT, for instance, is only equipped with data up to 2021. This constraint can lead to knowledge deficiencies and outdated information if the tool misreads command. These limitations would contribute to incorrect or inaccurate responses as knowledge continues to progress. For instance, if asked to incorporate recent references, the tool might invent seemingly valid ones that don’t refer to actual sources. The effectiveness of generative AI is also contingent on data quality. If the training data is of poor quality, the tool’s responses might be imprecise and untrustworthy. Furthermore, generative AI may not deeply comprehend the meanings of the words it handles. It identifies patterns and crafts plausible replies but might not fully understand the underlying notions of the words. This could lead to responses that occasionally lack depth and discernment and possibly deviate from the topic, especially when tasked with activities demanding a subtle grasp of specific domain knowledge.

# Research agenda

The following RQs provide a road map for future research on generative AI in education:

- How do generative AI tools promote educational sustainability?
- What are the optimal ways to promote Industry 5.0 (involving humans and generative education?
- What are the drivers and barriers to adopting generative AI tools in education?
- How can generative AI tools be used to support students with disabilities?
- How can educators ensure the originality of students’ work in the era of generative AI?

# Generative AI in Banking

# Overview

The advancement of AI has resulted in generative AI, which involves using algorithms and models to create new, original content such as text, images, and videos. Unlike AI-based Chatbot that relies on preexisting data to make predictions or answer the user’s request, generative AI can create new data on its own, based on the patterns and structures it has learned from the training data. Generative AI has become increasingly popular due to its ability to create and generate new insights, data, and content. It was reported that ChatGPT exceeded 1 million users five days after its launch.

While it can be said that the most prominent examples of generative AI are ChatGPT and DALL-E, it is imperative to recognize the swift evolution of these generative AI and the emerging innovations are backed by well-funded companies such as Google and Microsoft. OpenAI developed ChatGPT, Microsoft developed the Microsoft 365 Copilot, whereas Google developed Bard. Beyond text, generative AI like MusicLM can generate music and Midjourney can generate images. Ultimately, generative AI learns the underlying patterns from the training data to make it useful for various applications such as content creation, synthesis of images and videos, as well as natural language processing across different industries.

With the enormous amount of data available to banks and financial services providers, this commentary recognizes the prospects for generative AI to enhance financial services provision by autonomously learning from financial data. Banks are crucial service providers that interact with consumers, businesses, and organizations. They possess vast amounts of data that can be utilized for AI and ML applications like generative AI. With the growing prospects of generative AI and the banks’ access to large data sets, there are opportunities for banks to start exploring how to integrate generative AI into their business operations.

# Opportunities

# Creating a Generative AI Model for Banking

The abundant data available to banks presents possibilities for creating models to respond to customers’ inquiries and train staff on financial services and products. While ChatGPT is a general-purpose LLM based on big data which is available over the internet, banks are expected to create generative AI models that can offer specific insight for financial services. This would be building on the works done by Bloomberg which has introduced its own generative AI called BloombergGPT that has been trained on a variety of financial data, including Bloomberg’s financial data archives and public sources. Bloomberg set out to build a model that achieves best-in-class results on financial benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general-purpose LLM benchmarks. BloombergGPT is an indicator of what is to come in fintech whereby financial firms use their data to create ChatGPT-like models. While BloombergGPT represents the first step in developing and applying this technology in the financial industry, no public-facing chatbot interface exists. Instead, BloombergGPT is being integrated into Bloomberg Terminal.

There are enormous opportunities for banks, especially for commercial and retail banks, to consider developing domain-focused generative AI tools to enhance their business operations. They have the data and can start training models with these data to develop and provide a platform for consumer engagement.

# Customer Engagement

Aligning with the idea of creating a domain-focused generative AI model, consumers can also use this platform to engage with banks to ask a question that applies to their needs. For example, consumers can ask for advice based on their individual characteristics.

Prompts such as “I am employed full time, I have three children, I have a mortgage, and I have a personal debt of £25,000, what financial advice can you offer me?” The bank’s generative AI should be able to offer some financial advice and recommendation based on the large data set used to train the model. This generative AI builds on existing technology infrastructure for chatbots that can assist customers with their banking needs. These chatbots can understand natural language and provide personalized responses to customer queries. Generative AI can also be used to develop investment strategies that can optimize portfolio returns based on various factors, such as risk tolerance, market conditions, and asset allocation.

# Fraud detection

From a banking perspective, generative AI models have access to a large amount of data (e.g., legal, fraud, and compliance documents) which would assist in understanding patterns of fraud and other financial crimes. Generative AI can be used to detect fraudulent transactions in banking services. These models can identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data in real-time and proactively flag potential fraudulent transactions.

# Marketing communication

Banks can use generative AI to develop marketing communication campaigns that appeal to their target audience. As Mogaji et al. proposed, the possibilities of using AI to personalize emotionally appealing advertisements and the creative ability of generative AI to use images, text, and music could assist banks with the generation of personalized advertisements for their customers. Instead of having a generic marketing communication, banks can use generative AI to develop messages that align with the particular interest of their consumers. This would serve as opportunities for personalized messages based on the available data for the market segment. This personalized approach may include sending personalized birthday, religious, or cultural event greetings to their customers with unique images, text, and music based on their interests.

# Streamlining business operations

Banks can use generative AI to streamline their business operations, from mundane back-end activities to

# 16 K.-B. OOI ET AL.

consumer-facing inquiries and interactions. As shown in Figure 3, contact center agents, advisors, and developers can engage with generative AI tools to take proactive steps to suggest personalized actions such as introducing a new savings account or proposing specific products to a customer. For example, A financial adviser can input customers’ transactions into a generative AI model to understand the consumers’ spending habits and offer a personalized service. Banks can use the generative AI model to create customer segments, understand their common interests and pain points, as well as determine the best way to engage with them. In addition, generative AI models can be used for training staff, streamlining repetitive and time-consuming tasks, serving as a virtual assistant to respond to customers’ increasingly complex inquiries as well as releasing staff from routine tasks to concentrate more on innovative and strategic responsibilities which would lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and accuracy.89

# Challenges

# The infrastructure

It is imperative to recognize that financial services are significantly regulated.90,91 The use of technology, access to data, and provision of financial services may serve as challenges. Even if regulatory demands are met, having the infrastructure to make generative AI or any form of digital technology in banking services work can also be challenging.91,92 While recognizing the efforts by Bloomberg, it is imperative to recognize that it was a domain-specific generative AI developed by a single company using their proprietary data. The challenge lies in exploring a working relationship between various banks for the possibility of sharing and combining data to develop a banking generative AI model. This collaboration will, however, present significant implications surrounding competition, data privacy, and ethics.81,82

# Access to data

While data is essential for training these generative AI models, access to quality data is critical and can also present a significant challenge. While the established, traditional, and old brands may have access to extensive proprietary data by virtue of their long years of operations and customer base, there are significant challenges for newer banks and fintech companies. While established banks like HSBC, Barclays, and Lloyds in the United Kingdom may use data they already have to develop their generative AI model, app-only banks like Starling and Monzo may have significant challenges in accessing huge quantities of data for their models. As such, they would have to depend on publicly available financial data which might not offer detailed information for consumers who wants to use the model. On the other hand, the provision of data for generative AI also presents a significant challenge, especially as Wall Street banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo are cracking down on AI-powered chatbot,93 there are concerns surrounding the effective and safe ways of using these technologies.

# Accuracy of the results

As it is well known with generative AI tools, the generated insights may sometimes be wrong.9 They might produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts. This limitation has enormous implications for financial services providers, especially in cases where trust is very important. This inaccurate output will also have significant implications for consumers, staff, and other stakeholders who may rely on such output. As with the example of the customer using the generative AI model to look for financial advice, the assurance that the right financial advice has been provided is in question. Moreover, who takes the responsibility for providing those inaccurate and misleading advice? The bank that provided the AI model or the customer who did not use the correct prompt. As stated by Mogaji et al.,84 the implications of AI on the digital marketing of financial services to vulnerable customers, generative AI may not be suitable for offering financial decisions on loans and other forms of borrowings as it would be biased if they are trained on biased data.

# Recommendations

# The regulatory requirements

Banks would need to reflect on the regulatory nature of their service provision and its impact on technology. As banks have been regulated with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and AI,91 it is imperative to recognize that generative AI will find its way into financial services providers. Regulators must be more responsive and proactive in providing advice and guidance on integrating generative AI into their business operations.89 Regulators and banks need to start discussing if and how they can work together to provide a regulatory framework for developing and using generative AI.

# Collaboration

Banks must reflect on their collaborative network to build these generative AI models. When working with

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

# Policymakers’ responsibilities

It is expected that the generative AI model will disrupt financial services. Thus, it is imperative to understand policymakers’ responsibility and preparedness for this disruption. As Huang reflected on the UK’s regulatory guidance on crypto-assets, research needs to evaluate the attitude of policymakers and what they are doing to help manage the impending technology transformation. Future research must understand if policymakers are trying to stop it or provide the relevant infrastructure needed to support it. Specifically, Mogaji and Nguyen examined managers’ comprehension on digital transformation of financial services in several countries. They found that policymaking in developing countries is lagging, indicating a need for further research to identify the differences in approaches between developing and developed nations.

# The use of generative AI

Banks must reflect on who will use the generative AI if and when it is developed. Would this generative AI be available to consumers seeking financial advice or bank managers for training and streamlining business operations? As with BloombergGPT which does not have a public-facing chatbot interface, banks will need to determine if they want to make generative AI available for consumers. This model can also be made available to third-party organizations including credit agencies and personal finance management apps. While it has advantages in enhancing financial services provision, there are significant implications on ethics, access to data, and trust in the advice offered.

# Generative AI in retailing

# Overview

The many waves of digitalization have constantly resulted in disruptions in the retail industry. In the past, retail activities (e.g., inventory management, sales) had to be done physically and manually. Since then, innovations such as the cash register and barcode have automated some aspects of retailing. More recently, the Internet has allowed companies to carry out their retail activities digitally via electronic retailing (e-tailing). With that said, e-tailing has been incorporated into the operations of many retailers ranging from small, local ones to multinational giants. This is predominantly due to the relatively low barriers to entry into e-tailing and increased digitalization among the general public.

# Research agenda

# Consumer awareness and attitude

Future research should investigate consumers’ awareness and attitudes toward generative AI by financial services providers. It is imperative to engage with consumers to evaluate if they would be willing to use it for financial advice, trust the output of generative AI, and envisage its use in banking services. Therefore, this research strand will extend the existing research on generative AI for banking services.

# Managers’ awareness and attitude

As Mogaji and Nguyen evaluated managers’ understanding of AI concerning marketing financial services, future research will be required to understand bank employees’ willingness and attitudes toward generative AI. This research strand would need to include contact center agents, advisors, and marketing executives to evaluate their understanding of generative AI, level of technical capabilities to use these models, and impact on their job. As generative AI is posited to disrupt financial services workforces, future research needs to evaluate bank managers’ attitudes and preparedness for the disruption presented by generative AI.

In view of this, many retailers around the world have started integrating generative AI into their operations. For example, the grocery delivery company Instacart.

uses generative AI to answer questions from its custo- media sentiment. Based on this, detailed customer profiles with personalized recommendations and retail experiences can be generated. Expedia is a company that has integrated generative AI into its mobile application to provide users with personalized travel recommendations and planning assistance. Furthermore, companies can also employ generative AI to encourage customer co-creation. For instance, Coca-Cola encouraged people to create art through its new generative AI platform for a chance to be featured on its digital billboards. These would help retailers in enhancing their marketing strategies by understanding the customers’ preferred types of advertising; thereby increasing their competitive advantage and customer satisfaction.

# Opportunities

There are endless opportunities that can be gained from integrating and deriving value from generative AI in the retail setting. This is because there is still much untapped potential as retailers are only in the early stages of incorporating generative AI with their operations. More recently, Google and Microsoft have made their generative AI available via an application programming interface. One key implication is that it enables retailers to integrate these tools into their systems. With that said, generative AI can offer benefits to retailers with regard to their front-end and back-end operations. More specifically, front-end operations refer to the retail activities that directly impact customers which include marketing and customer service. In contrast, back-end operations denote the functions that support retail activities that happen behind the scenes such as merchandising and data management.

# Challenges

There are challenges that retailers need to overcome for the successful integration of generative AI into their operations. This section specifically highlights three major challenges which can be collectively referred to as the 3Ds.

The first challenge is related to data. It is undeniable that data plays a significant role in the utilization of generative AI to supplement various retail activities. While there is a lot more data available than ever before, it is fragmented across different platforms and sources. Besides, not all data is relevant in the decision-making of different retail activities. On the other hand, the lack of data is a problem that is pertinent among smaller retailers. This is because smaller retailers are unable to generate large volumes of data given the

scale of their operations. This will put them at a major disadvantage as data is essential in refining the results of generative AI. Moreover, privacy is another significant concern as the input data and resulting insights are stored in the generative AI’s servers. Following this, Samsung has banned its employees from utilizing generative AI on company-owned devices and networks.

In the retail setting, data tends to include customer information that is sensitive (e.g., bank account number) and identifiable (e.g., name). This would entail a certain level of risk to retailers as there is the potential for confidential details to be leaked or disclosed to others. Thus, retailers will not only need to have a sufficient amount of data but also carefully curate and protect the data that is used for generative AI.

# Retailers’ perspective

The integration of generative AI into their operations would be a huge undertaking for many retailers. This is because it is a relatively novel innovation with various applications in the retail setting. It would thus require retailers to reconsider some of their strategic decisions. With that said, a retail company’s internal environment is comprised of multiple stakeholders. Thus, there would be differing perceptions, hesitancy, and readiness toward integrating generative AI into the current business operations. In view of this, the research questions that can be addressed by future research include:

- What critical success factors will retailers need to address before, during, and after integrating generative AI with their operations?
- To what extent should retailers integrate generative AI into the various retail operations?
- How should retailers handle (e.g., access, curate, protect) data that is being utilized for generative AI?
- How can retailers leverage generative AI to enhance their customer relationships (e.g., acquisition, retention) and interactions?

# Customers’ perspective

The customer is undeniably the most crucial stakeholder that retailers have to consider when integrating generative AI into their operations. This is because they play an important role in determining its sustainability and success. However, the current literature surrounding the different responses that customers would develop toward the application of generative AI in the retail sector still needs to be extended. Following that, future studies can employ a multi-dimensional approach to look into retail customers’ behavior toward generative AI with a focus on the following research questions:

- How will customers’ resistance/acceptance of generative AI for retail purposes vary in different contexts (e.g., product category, geographic location)?
- How will generative AI affect customers’ perceptions, decision-making, motivations, and behaviors when conducting retail activities?
- How will the customers’ experiences with retailing change following the application of generative AI?

# Generative AI in the Workplace

# Overview

Since the release of several generative AI platforms in recent years such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bard, and Midjourney, there has been a growing interest in how these advances can change the workplace. The impact of such generative AI platforms is not limited to text generation but also extends to image generation and code creation. Following this, the proposed impact of generative AI is not restricted to one sector of the economy and has important ramifications for a plethora of roles and job profiles. A recent survey conducted by Mercer indicated that 57% of CEOs and CFOs plan to increase the use of AI for automating tasks whereas roughly a third of respondents are planning to redesign work processes to reduce their dependency on people. Simultaneously, there is also a growing use of generative AI platforms by professionals to augment and complement their work. While AI has been traditionally seen as a tool to reduce repetitive and rule-based work, generative AI platforms are prompting significant changes in less structured and creative tasks. As such, work in professions such as those in programming, architectural, writing, and customer service will be significantly impacted.

Generative AI is posited to influence a range of different tasks in the workplace, from automating manual and highly structured tasks to augmenting decision-making in complex and unstructured activities. By introducing generative AI to replace or augment such tasks, it is anticipated that there will be several significant shifts on the organizational level as well as the ways individuals, teams, and business units work and function. In exploring the impact of generative AI, existing research has focused on the changing role of the individual within the workplace. Its effects on individual employees within the workplace are likely the most immediate. On this level, there have been a multitude of studies concerning the potential effects that generative AI will have in displacing jobs and leading to the emergence of novel forms of work. Research in this area has not only focused on the effect on employment but also on perceptions and attitudes of individuals whose work is likely to be affected. Nevertheless, generative AI is now moving from the realm of science fiction to reality with much of the debate that has been largely speculative has now turned.

# Opportunities

The introduction of generative AI in the workplace can create a plethora of opportunities for professionals. Following the discussion of several past studies, generative AI has the potential to automate manual processes and free up employees from highly structured tasks. The affordances offered by generative AI platforms allow for the handling of data in a more detailed manner and facilitate interactions with the end users that are more “human-like.” Nevertheless, the true power of generative AI lies in its ability to enhance and support creative tasks. A major opportunity within the workplace is utilizing different types of generative AI to augment creative tasks. One example is the case of using visual-based generative AI platforms for enhancing tasks related to design. A challenge designers face when developing proposals for customers is that it is often difficult to translate the requirements into a satisfactory outcome and rendering different conceptual sketches is very time-consuming. Many generative AI tools for interior design, floor-planning, rendering of architectural plans, and landscape design have become increasingly available with outputs that are impressive. These tools are thus facilitating completely new opportunities for professionals in this industry and changing how work is done in a fundamental manner.

Such disruptions in the workplace are not only apparent in the design industry but also to other professions in which the tasks were once thought to only be possible to be undertaken by humans. For instance, developing programming scripts, analyzing data, or composing music are now just some of the activities that generative AI can perform. This can lead to greater access to information and a servitization or even democratization of higher-order skills. Hence, it will no longer be necessary for individuals to spend several years learning how to program in order to develop customized software or understand the basics of music and composition in order to creatively express their musical inclinations. An emerging opportunity in this regard is that many of the skills that consider bound to humans can be commodified and available through simple interfaces. This would have important influences on how individuals will work and collaborate in the workplace. By reducing the time and effort it takes to develop code or render an architectural sketch, it is likely to increase the quality and...

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

creativity of work that is produced in different sectors. For example, generative AI can help improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall costs for them by offering personalized treatment plans and diagnoses. 130 This can be achieved by analyzing the patients’ medical results and identifying potential health issues that may be inadvertently missed by clinicians. Similarly, generative AI can be used to personalize customer shopping experiences by recommending products based on their past preferences and behavior. 131 Furthermore, generative AI can help financial institutions detect fraudulent transactions and reduce the risk of financial crime. 132 Additionally, these affordances enabled by generative AI allow individuals to have greater access to information. Within the workplace, intelligent automation and augmentation of work are likely to facilitate more interactions among employees who would previously need to dedicate a large portion of their time to tasks that required direct interaction with technologies. Therefore, an opportunity for generative AI in the workplace is that it can minimize the time individuals spend engaging with their technologies to complete respective tasks and instead utilize the time to collaborate with their colleagues, customers, and business partners.

# Challenges

While there are ample opportunities in the workplace to adopt generative AI, there are also many challenges and potential risks. One key issue is that while the technology that generative AI is built on appears to have reached an impressive level, there is still a lack of understanding as to how such technologies can be integrated into the workplace in a way that generates value. 133 Companies appear to have a limited understanding of how to systematize the deployment of generative AI with most workplace applications appearing to be motivated by the individual employees. 134 This tendency can create imbalances between different groups of employees; those that are familiar with generative AI and see the value in utilizing it for their work-related tasks and those that have little knowledge or are apprehensive about using such technologies. Such division of employees may give rise to tensions and cause friction in workplace relations.

Furthermore, as large parts of the creative process may be assigned to generative AI, changes will likely be observed in the moral and psychological well-being of employees. Apart from the obvious issue of job displacement, the loss of purpose in one’s work and the transfer of the creative process to a “black box” may lead to severe consequences in the drive of many creative professionals. Given the lack of understanding on how organizations should approach the diffusion of such technologies in the workplace, it may result in a loss of productivity. In addition, a potential issue that might arise from using third-party generative AI tools concerns the intellectual ownership of outputs. 135 Organizations may find themselves in a minefield, whereby they are automatically at a disadvantage compared to their rivals if they do not utilize such platforms. However, if they do, they are not the owners of important intellectual property. Bridging these issues on the individual, team, and organizational levels are posited to be major challenges in the years to follow.

# Research agenda

While the proliferation of generative AI will lead to substantial opportunities in the workplace, it also comes with a variety of challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome. Undoubtedly, this phenomenon opens up many interesting questions that researchers can look to answer. An exhaustive list of such topics would not be possible given that very little is known about how generative AI will change the workplace. However, several major themes that will likely dominate research in the next years are presented below:

# Governing generative AI

The concept of governance can be interpreted in many ways depending on the authority that exercises it. However, it can be argued that an important context in which there will be a need to define some rules, processes, and structures is that of the workplace. More specifically, when it comes to using generative AI for creative tasks, it is important for information systems and HRM research to go beyond the scope of conceptualizing technology governance as a set of practices to optimize the use of technology toward organizational goals, but also to encompass how technology utilization influences the well-being of employees within the workplace. 136 Hence, there is a need to understand how the use of generative AI in organizational settings influences both the cognitive and psychological states of employees, as well as how it defines their interactions and modes of collaboration. Delving into this topic is likely going to be very challenging as it will require an understanding of the employees’ emotional and cognitive states over time while integrating aspects of team performance and collaboration. Before, technology has been primarily examined as the platform to which collaboration

# Generative AI in manufacturing

# Overview

The fourth industrial revolution envisions the adoption of digitalization, automation, and connectivity technologies in the manufacturing industry that will empower manufacturers to improve their production processes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. Generative AI is an example of such technology that has created a lot of excitement in the manufacturing industry. While the principles are not entirely new, its ability to produce human readable output based on text input offers enormous potential for manufacturers. As a whole, generative AI can be utilized to explore and execute optimal solutions, create novel outputs according to functional specifications, costs, and achieve efficient lead time through the combinations of design and production options.

# Algorithmic creative control

Another key issue that is likely to concern future research is the role of generative AI as the dominant creative force in several industries. While the outputs from such platforms may be seen as a means of enhancing productivity and creativity for many professions, the flip side is that maybe they will gradually replace or take over control of the creative processes. The draw toward AI-generated outcomes may render human creativity irrelevant in the workplace. With that said, very little is known about the long-term effects of moving in this direction as well as how individuals in the creative professions may feel about the creative element of their work being dictated by opaque algorithms. In this regard, it is important to understand how the deployment of generative AI would be done so that employees do not feel controlled in their creative tasks. Moreover, it is important to understand optimal ways of working with generative AI so that an effective augmentation of the creative processes can take place.

# Opportunities

A common issue in the manufacturing industry is the shortage of talents with highly technical, manual, and operational skills, knowledge, and expertise. Some of the attributable reasons for the skills gap include an aging and reduced workforce as well as changing skill sets due to new technology. According to Deloitte, the coming years will see a need for the “ability to program machines on the plant floor.” Although daunting, generative AI offers a promise to bridge this gap through careful investments and a new generation of workforce building. For example, generative AI can be used to train workers on new skills and technologies by offering personalized learning for a more effective learning experience.

# Collaboration in the age of generative AI

One of the fundamental changes of generative AI concerns the changes in the creative process. Typically, high-skilled professionals in creative industries have certain modes of operating and collaborating in which digital tools are utilized to complement this process. The generative AI platforms that have been seen to date mostly rely on individual input and interaction in creating outcomes. Thus, the question that arises is in which way will future generative AI platforms be designed to cater to the needs of specific professionals. While there is an increasing number of generative AI tools emerging with specialized use for more niche groups, the emphasis to date has been on optimizing the end result and not accommodating the means of collaboration. As such, it will be interesting to investigate how the design of the interfaces for generative AI can accommodate or redefine certain ways of collaboration among professionals. As of now, very little is known as to how collaborative work should define requirements for generative AI tools. However, it is likely that generative AI and its affordances will radically reshape the ways in which professionals work together.

Generative AI can help manufacturers “look ahead” and anticipate disruptions through simulations and predictions of impacts. Generative AI can be employed to perform an analysis of various data sources for real-time defects identification which would reduce the reliance.

# JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS

# Challenges

Companies need to ensure they have the necessary computing infrastructure and data storage to support generative AI and ensure interoperability.140 Manufacturing sites often employ a variety of machines, tools, and production systems that may not be compatible. As such, plant engineers are often relied upon to determine how the different technologies best work together. The lack of a common framework means that integrating generative AI with current production systems may require significant upfront investment in terms of technical capability.

# Research agenda

We call for the development of case studies and empirical studies on the adoption of generative AI in the manufacturing industry. Manufacturers seeking to integrate generative AI would need to understand the types of tasks that can be credibly employed and what are the best practices in order to fully realize the benefits of generative AI. The potential impacts of generative AI on job displacements, security, privacy, and biases as well as environmental impacts require further attention. Thus, research on how to incorporate generative AI in the workplace, training, and reskilling employees for acceptance will be helpful in preparing the workforce. Finally, the ethical use of generative AI raises concerns surrounding privacy, security, accountability, and fairness. Therefore, guiding frameworks and policies are needed to inform and govern its use.

design and development, this section expounds on how generative AI can support sustainability management in the IT industry. By enabling more efficient and effective resource usage, lowering waste, as well as enhancing environmental performance, generative AI has the potential to significantly improve IT sustainability management. Generative AI has enormous potential as it can create original responses which are applicable to decision-making, design, optimization, and simulation. For instance, when it comes to designing, generative AI can help in producing optimum structures or layouts based on predetermined criteria. By investigating several options, it can produce answers for challenging problems in optimization. For testing and analysis, generative AI may build virtual worlds and scenarios in simulation. It can assist in creating alternative scenarios and assessing probable outcomes during decision-making. IT has the potential to become substantially more sustainable thanks to generative AI. There are two ways in which generative AI and sustainability are related. On the one hand, generative AI can help promote sustainable development. For example, raising public awareness of climate change and others by minimizing its negative effects. “AI for sustainability” is defined in this fashion. On the other hand, managing IT resources in a way that balances environmental, social, and economic factors is referred to as sustainable IT. Companies can obtain a variety of advantages from the application of generative AI in sustainable IT such as improving resource efficiency and reducing environmental impacts of IT operations.

# Opportunities

# Generative AI and energy savings for the IT sector

The energy usage of data centers, which serves as a crucial part of the IT industry, significantly contributes to greenhouse emissions. However, by forecasting demand and modifying power management accordingly, AI can assist in maximizing energy use in data centers. In order to promote real-time electricity trade, generative AI can be employed to predict the evolution of energy prices based on forecasts of supply and demand. Additionally, studies show that robots and AI technologies can be used more frequently to monitor and maintain energy plants. Machine learning algorithms, for instance, may monitor server usage data and modify power consumption in real time, eliminating energy waste and yielding considerable energy savings. One illustration of this is the employment of Google’s DeepMind AI to cut the energy usage of Google’s data centers by 40%. DeepMind examined server usage data and forecasted demand, enabling it to modify power management and lower energy waste. Google was able to drastically cut its energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions which highlighted the potential of AI to increase energy efficiency in the IT industry. Another illustration is Microsoft’s AI for Earth initiative, which uses AI to address environmental issues such as lowering data centers’ carbon footprints. Microsoft uses AI to streamline the operations of its data centers, which has led to significant energy savings and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Data centers may reduce their environmental impact and support IT industry sustainability by employing AI to optimize energy use.

# Generative AI and IT resource administration for sustainability

Distributed IT solutions, including cloud and edge computing, use a lot of computational power and bandwidth. However, generative AI can improve how these resources are distributed which will lead to effective usage and minimal waste. By dynamically allocating resources according to demand, for example, generative AI can make better use of resources that would lessen the environmental impacts of IT systems. This was done, for instance, by using IBM’s Watson AI to improve resource distribution in cloud computing. It allowed for more effective distribution of resources and cutting down on waste thanks to the data analysis on resource utilization and forecasting of future demand. As a result, IBM was able to lessen its impact on the environment and support sustainability in the IT industry.

# Generative AI for sustainability in purchasing

Another area where generative AI may help with sustainability management in the IT industry is sustainable buying. Organizations may make better-educated decisions regarding sustainable procurement from generative AI’s ability to assess and compare the product’s environmental footprint which includes carbon emissions, energy use, and material usage. As a result, the environmental impact of IT goods and services may be lessened. The Ecochain AI platform, which is used to evaluate the environmental impact of goods and services, is one example of this. Data about a product’s environmental impact, which includes carbon emissions, energy use, and material usage, is gathered and analyzed using AI. Using this information, recommendations are then made for more environmentally friendly purchasing choices.

# Generative AI in sustainable development and design

Another area where generative AI may help with sustainability management in the IT industry is sustainable design and development. By accessing data on the environmental impacts of various design decisions and making recommendations for eco-friendly hardware and software solutions, AI may support the design and development of sustainable IT systems. This may lead to the development of more sustainable IT goods and services. A program like Intel’s AI for Social Good, which uses AI to tackle social and environmental issues such as sustainability in the IT industry, is an illustration of this. Intel is analyzing data on the environmental impact of various designs using AI.

# Data center administration

Since data centers consume a lot of energy, managing them efficiently is crucial for minimizing the environmental impact of IT operations. Automating data center administration and resource optimization are two ways generative AI might be useful. Much of the energy consumption is attributed to data centers that store data which is ultimately fed into AI. Data centers currently utilize 2% of the world’s electricity and is expected to use nearly 6% of the world’s energy by 2030. Generative AI, for instance, can examine data on energy consumption patterns, cooling system usage, and server utilization in order to provide real-time insights on data center performance. This data will help the organization use resources more efficiently, less energy, and reduce its carbon footprint.

# Manage electronic waste

To lessen the environmental impact of IT operations, it is imperative to manage electronic trash (e-waste) sustainably. Bogue sheds light on the current applications and potential future roles of robots and AI in recycling, a field that historically relied heavily on labor. Generative AI can assist by processing data on the production of e-waste and offering management-related insights. Generative AI, for instance, can examine data on the IT equipment life cycle to find chances for equipment refurbishment, recycling, or disposal. This knowledge can be employed to improve e-waste management, lessen the environmental impact of IT operations, and raise the social responsibility of the company.

# Supply chain administration

As it entails controlling the environmental and social effects of IT equipment manufacturing, shipping, and disposal, supply chain management is a crucial component of sustainable IT. Real-time insights into supply chain efficiency and the detection of problems can be provided by AI, which can be helpful. Using data on suppliers’ social and environmental performance, for instance, generative AI can examine supply chain potential. This would enable companies to improve their supply chain management, lessen their environmental impact of IT operations, and increase their social responsibility.

# Challenges

# Energy consumption

Generative AI tools in particular use a lot of processing power which would then lead to higher energy usage. The IT industry needs to develop energy-efficient algorithms, optimize hardware infrastructure, and use renewable energy sources in efforts to address the environmental effects of generative AI.

# Data & model bias

For generative AI tools that have been trained on biased or unreliable data, they may continue to reinforce current social, economic, and environmental injustices. In order for generative AI tools to be effective, the training data must be representative, diverse, and bias-free. It is also crucial to create methods for reducing and detecting bias in the results produced by AI.

# E-trash management

The IT industry’s brisk adoption of new innovations such as generative AI necessitates frequent hardware replacements and the disposal of trash (e-waste). In an effort to reduce the negative environmental effects of discarded IT equipment and encourage recycling and ethical disposal techniques, effective e-waste management policies should be put into place.

# Ethical aspects

The use of generative AI should adhere to ethical concepts and rules. In general, generative AI should be used responsibly and ethically. To ensure that generative AI is utilized responsibly, does not violate human rights, or causes harm to society, the IT industry must address concerns about privacy, security, transparency, and accountability.

# Lifecycle assessment

It is vital to evaluate the environmental impact of generative AI at every stage of their lifecycle from conception and development to operationalization and decommissioning. Comprehensive life cycle assessments can be employed to pinpoint problem areas and facilitate the creation of sustainable generative AI systems.

# Regulatory frameworks

To control the creation, implementation, and application of generative AI systems, the IT sector needs clear and efficient regulatory frameworks. To guarantee that generative AI make positive contributions to sustainable development, these frameworks should look to address issues such as energy efficiency, data protection, and ethical AI practices.

# Workforce development and skill gaps

A competent workforce is necessary to successfully integrate generative AI and sustainability management in the IT industry. By providing training programs and educational efforts that give professionals the information and skills that they need to effectively design and maintain sustainable AI solutions, the skill gap can be bridged.

# Transparency and explainability

Generative AI models may generate results that are complicated in terms of comprehension or explanation. This would make it difficult to judge the consequences they have on sustainability. Promoting trust, responsibility, and sustainability in the IT industry requires ways to decipher and explain the results produced by generative AI.

# Concluding remarks

Generative AI is a technological innovation with endless potential to transform businesses and society. Despite its immense potential, there are still limitations that need to be acknowledged and present across all industries, including but not limited to privacy, ethical dimensions, and issues related to data ownership. It is only by overcoming these limitations will businesses be able to effectively implement generative AI into their operations. Overall, this paper provides diverse viewpoints in the fields of marketing, healthcare, human resource, learning, banking services, retailing, workplace, manufacturing, and sustainability management. By expounding on the opportunities and challenges surrounding the integration of generative AI in different fields, it is believed that this paper will spur future research in this area.

# ABSTRACT

For many decades, there has been a debate about the relation between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). Our study presents a review of academic research on this topic by applying a second-order meta-analysis. The data sample combines 25 previous meta-analyses yielding a sample size of one million observations. Our results demonstrate a highly significant, positive, robust, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation. The relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key CSP determinant. We find a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation for operational CFP. Furthermore, we add a new perspective on potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: social issues-oriented journals and methodological weaker papers do not distort the positive CSP-CFP relation. Our conclusion is: Based on the extant literature, the business case for being a good firm is undeniable. © 2018 The Authors.

# Introduction

WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN CORPORATE SOCIAL/ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CSP) AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)? For nearly 50 years, scholars have investigated this question. The search for the answer has become particularly prominent since the end of the 1990s. Our study sample comprises 1214 empirical primary studies on the CSP-CFP relation. While considerable research has been conducted, it is as yet less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and in which way various moderating factors determine the CSP-CFP relation (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Peloza, 2009). Moreover, the robustness of the business case over time has only occasionally been analyzed (Borgers, Derwall, Koedijk, & ter Horst, 2013; Derwall, Koedijk, & Ter Horst, 2011). The aim of this study is to provide a more detailed understanding of the CSP-CFP relation.

# T. Busch and G. Friede

In 2003, the widely cited Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) meta-study responded to calls for a moratorium on CSP-CFP research (Margolis & Walsh, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Orlitzky et al. (2003) found a significant, positive, and bidirectional correlation of CSP with CFP. Despite these findings, the authors claim that this relation cannot be generalized across all CSP dimensions and CFP categories, detecting a large variability – even after correcting for sampling error and measurement error. Since then, the picture has become even more ambiguous and critical debates have resurfaced about the actual CSP-CFP relation (Aldag, 2013; Barnett, 2007; Borgers et al., 2013; Devinney, 2009; Fleming & Jones, 2013; Orlitzky, 2011, 2013; Wood, 2010). On the one hand, many scholars claim that, to date, the literature on the CSP-CFP relation remains inconclusive. On the other hand, a whole range of new studies and further meta-analyses have been published supporting a positive relation. Thus, more than a decade after Orlitzky et al. (2003), it seems to be the right time to revive the paper’s spirit and ask: when generalizing existing research, is there still evidence that it pays off to be a good firm?

To answer this question, we apply a second-order meta-analysis. In other scientific disciplines like medicine, psychology, or education (i.e. research areas typically also experiencing vast amounts of data and conflicting results), meta-analytic techniques are widespread and have been applied since the 1960s (Glass, 1976; Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter, Schmidt, & Jackson, 1982). With the growing number of meta-analyses, the idea of cumulative meta-analysis also appeared (Kazrin, Durac, & Agteros, 1979). Several labels have been used for such analyses: overview of reviews, review of reviews, umbrella reviews, meta-reviews, cumulative meta-analyses, meta-meta-analysis, and second-order meta-analysis (Cooper & Koenka, 2012). However, until recently, no standard procedure with comparable rigor to first-order meta-analytical approaches had emerged. This paper makes use of the novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis proposed by Schmidt and Oh (2013).

We contribute to the academic inquiry on the CSP-CFP relation in several regards. By summarizing the findings of existing meta-analyses and utilizing a data sample that is more than 25 times larger compared to the average of previous studies, we are able to generate fairly robust results. Not only do we demonstrate that the main findings of Orlitzky and colleagues still hold today, but our results deliver more unequivocal and comprehensive conclusions. The highly significant, positive, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation varies in magnitude depending on different CSP dimensions and CFP categories, but effect sizes are less variable than expected. Surprisingly, the relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key aspect. We highlight that a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation exists when operational CFP is considered. Furthermore, we conclude that shrinking CSP-CFP correlations in meta-analyses over time can be ascribed to more sophisticated research methods and are not observable at primary study level. Finally, we address potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: we show that social issues-oriented and lower-impact journals as well as methodological weaker papers do not distort the CSP-CFP relation. The practical relevance of our second-order meta-analysis is: the business case for being a good firm is undeniable.

# Hypotheses

Theoretical arguments support a positive, negative, as well as neutral CSP-CFP relation. Arguments supporting a positive CSP-CFP relation are typically rooted in stakeholder theory (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Freeman, 1984), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), or draw on the industrial organization literature (Porter, 1979). When arguing for a negative CSP-CFP relation, scholars usually refer to Levitt’s (1958) or Friedman’s (1962, 1970) logic of social responsibility of the firm to solely increase its profits. Moreover, arguments based on portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952, 1959) point towards disadvantageous limitations for portfolio construction when picking stocks following a CSP filter. Finally, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970, 1991) argue for a neutral – or at least non-exploitable – relation of CSP and CFP, as all information is priced at any time by the market. This also includes potentially business-relevant CSP information.

Next to these differing theoretical perspectives, the empirical CSP-CFP debate to date faces several questions. Even though considerable primary research has been conducted, it still remains less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and whether the business case holds as well for different measures of CFP. Eventually, questions of robustness and moderating effects arise which need to be answered in order to derive.

# Corporate social and financial performance

unequivocal conclusions regarding the CSP-CFP relation and its manifestations. This paper seeks to answer some of these questions.

# The general CSP-CFP Relation

# Direction of the CSP-CFP

In the academic literature, to date, the business case for CSP seems to be increasingly accepted and empirically supported (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Eccles, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Flammer, 2015). In line with the outcomes of previous research that summarized large numbers of primary research (e.g. Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003) we, thus, propose:

H1a: CSP and CFP are generally positively related across a wide variety of study designs.

# Causality of the CSP-CFP Relation

Next to the general CSP-CFP relation, the subsequent question pertains to the causality of this relation. Proponents of good management theory (Waddock & Graves, 1997) argue that prior good CSP leads subsequently to better CFP. The opposite explanation is the slack resources theory (Cyert & March, 1963; J. B. McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), where excess financial resources of a company are seen as a necessary condition in order to reinvest and, thus, counter threats or exploit opportunities (Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, & Turner, 2004). Following this view, prior superior CFP leads subsequently to improved CSP. As both theories found theoretical and empirical support, a common argument is that there exists a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP – they seem to be related reciprocally and concurrently (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Waddock & Graves, 1997). We follow this line of thought and thus expect:

H1b: The causality of the CSP-CFP relation is bidirectional.

# The Relation of various CSP Dimensions and CFP

# Corporate Environmental Performance

Since the first review studies on the CSP-CFP relation (Aldag & Bartol, 1978; Arlow & Gannon, 1982), research has considered corporate environmental performance (CEP) as part of CSP. Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) were the first to split the CSP construct and analyze CEP separately. These authors assume investors and consumers are less aware of the environmental performance of firms. In contrast, social aspects are more likely to be publicly communicated and, thus, reflected by stock- and stakeholders. Accordingly, the authors report a weaker CEP-CFP correlation compared to the overall sample. Orlitzky et al. (2003) reiterate the weak relation between CEP and CFP. Over the course of the years, individual meta-studies dedicated specifically to CEP and/or the social dimension of CSP were published. The summary effects for the CEP-CFP relation were often positive and significant (Albertini, 2013; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, & Romi, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014). However, the absolute level usually demonstrated lower correlation levels compared to studies purely focusing on social aspects (Combs, Liu, Hall, & Ketchen, 2006; Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, & Ketchen, 2011; Unger, Rauch, Frese, & Rosenbusch, 2011). In line with these findings, we expect:

H2a: The relation between CSP (excluding environmental aspects) and CFP is stronger than for CEP and CFP.

# CSP Reputation

Four CSP dimensions attracted the greatest interest among meta-researchers in the past: CSP reputation, CSP disclosure, CSP philanthropy, and CSP audits, processes, and policies. CSP reputation (Barnett, Jermier, & Lafferty, 2006) typically yields high correlations with CFP. The reason being that corporate reputation is of particular importance.

relevance or interest to a variety of external parties. For example, reputation is likely to influence customers’ behaviours and investors’ decisions (Orlitzky et al., 2003). This intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate, leads to sustained superior profit over time (P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002). Literature reviews and meta-analytical results point in a similar direction (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Sabate & Puente, 2003). We, thus, hypothesize that CSP reputation plays a dominant role:

# H2b:

Within the CSP dimensions, reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP.

# CSP Disclosure

A more controversial debate exists regarding the link between CSP disclosure and CFP. Wiseman (1982) finds considerable discrepancies between CSP disclosures and actual CSP. Ullmann (1985) concludes that voluntary disclosure should not be considered as a proxy for CSP performance. R. W. Roberts (1992) discovers that stakeholder power, philanthropic activities, and previous economic performance significantly explain concurrent CSP disclosure. Orlitzky et al. (2003) ascribe a minimal positive relation between CSP disclosure practices and CFP, whereas additionally almost all of the observed effect size variance is due to statistical artifacts. Research in environmental management also nourishes a weak relation among both measures. Schultze and Trommer (2012, p. 396) summarize, based on a review of empirical research, that ‘as disclosure is mostly voluntary, many companies only provide beneficial rather than accurate, unbiased information on their current performance’. This could lead, in turn, to distorted information of market participants accompanied by increased stock volatility when investors realize that their investment decisions were based on wrong assumptions (Orlitzky, 2013). Thus, we expect a relatively weaker link of CSP disclosure and CFP:

# H2c:

Within the CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP.

# The Relation of CSP and various CFP Categories

# Perceptional CFP

Perceptual evaluations of business performance by senior executives are considered to be valid substitutes for objective CFP measures. The product–moment correlation coefficient between subjective and objective measures ranges in empirical studies between 0.4 and 0.8 (Guthrie, 2001; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987; Wall et al., 2004). Despite managers’ discretionary assessment of the firm performance, the judgment is often a fair reflection of financial reality and not per se overrated (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987). Depending on the research context, the application of survey-based measures can even be the preferred choice of researchers. A quarter of empirical studies in top management journals therefore use some kind of subjective organizational performance measure (P. J. Richard, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). Perceptual CFP measures are compiled by one-fifth of the meta-studies in our sample. We formulate our hypothesis in accordance with meta-analyses that report high correlations between CSP and perceptual CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006):

# H3a:

CSP has the strongest relation to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.

# Operational CFP

Operational performance such as productivity allows a nuanced conceptualization of business performance as it focuses on those operational success factors that might lead to superior CFP (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). As an intermediate-outcome metric (Peloza, 2009), it reflects information that is closer to the value creation process within a firm and more remote to the variety of interacting and overlapping factors like discretionary accounting practices or general stock market movements (P. J. Richard et al., 2009). McWilliams, Siegel, and Teoh (1999) caution not to use share prices as a sole metric for CFP when investigating the CSP-CFP relation. Effects of specific plant or product-level information on value creation cannot be fully captured by simply looking at market-based.

measures such as shareholder value. Therefore, the effects of CSP on operational CFP measures should be less likely to be drowned out by capital market ‘noise’ (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527). Empirical evidence for this argument was found in a meta-analysis on human resource factors (Combs et al., 2006): operational CFP measures such as staff turnover yield higher correlations than other accounting- or market-based performance categories. Similar results were carried out in the environmental supply chain context: operational CFP measures such as reduced material and waste streams demonstrated slightly higher correlations to market-based measures (Golicic & Smith, 2013). Thus, we hypothesize:

# H3b: CSP has a stronger relation to operational CFP than to market-based CFP.

# Traditional CFP Categories

When considering the range of the traditional CFP measures, Cochran and Wood (1984) propose that accounting-based CFP such as return on assets may be the best proxy for measuring CFP – presuming that the accounting practices of firms are comparable. They more adequately reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external evaluations of investors. Empirical evidence supports this: accounting-based CFP measures have a stronger relation to CSP than market-based CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006).

Growth-based CFP – typically determined by sales, profit, or employee growth – is not directly affected by capital market developments. However, companies’ growth can be distorted by inorganic growth from acquisitions or divestments. Such activities usually have a relatively higher impact on growth measures (O’Shaughnessy & Flanagan, 1998) compared to changes in accounting figures (King, Dalton, Daily, & Covin, 2004). Accordingly, empirical research finds a weaker CFP relation for growth as a CFP measure compared to accounting-based CFP (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2013; Unger et al., 2011).

With regards to risk, primary research (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; J. B. McGuire et al., 1988) suggests that CSP reduces companies’ risk. Most of the empirical studies measure risk either as accounting-based risk (i.e. debt to assets) or market-based risk (i.e. beta-factor, total volatility). However, the observed correlations in meta-analyses are relatively low (e.g. Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Summing up, these arguments bring us to the following hypothesis:

# H3c: Accounting-based CFP demonstrates a stronger relation to CSP than growth-, risk-, and market-based CFP.

# Mutual Funds

Several studies on mutual funds, financial indices, and virtual portfolios suggest that the positive CSP-CFP relation is weaker compared to studies using firm-specific CFP measures. To date, this result presents a puzzling outcome in CSP-CFP research. The first mutual funds studies appeared in the early 1990s. The initial findings of these early studies discovered that the performance of CSP-oriented mutual funds is not statistically different from the performance of conventional mutual funds (e.g. Hamilton, Jo, & Statman, 1993). However, ever since then, further investigations have been carried out in several primary and review studies (Bauer, Koedijk, & Otten, 2005; Capelle-Blancard & Monjon, 2014; Rathner, 2013; Revelli & Viviani, 2015), hardening the conclusion that the CSP-CFP link is weaker for mutual funds as compared to other CSP-CFP studies. In turn, we hypothesize:

# H3d: Studies on mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to studies using other CFP measures.

# Moderating Factors

The literature discusses a range of conditions under which CSP and CFP influence each other (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). In addition to the most common factors – company size and the type of industry.

(Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Buehler & Shetty, 1974; Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky, 2008) – several other moderating factors have been used in primary studies. These are visibility to the public and consumers (Fry, Keim, & Meiners, 1982; Jiang & Bansal, 2003), research and development investments (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000), economic conditions (Golicic & Smith, 2013), the level of diversification, advertising, government sales, consumer income, and stage in the industry as well as the firm life cycle (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Elsayed & Paton, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Since not all primary studies use the same bundle of control variables and/or moderating factors, it is difficult to compare such effects in meta-analyses. Thus, as meta-analysts have not adjusted for these factors in a comparable manner, we also cannot investigate these effects. Nonetheless, a few central moderating factors can be assessed at second-order level.

# Effects over Time

It is not unusual that academic studies investigating a specific effect for the first time demonstrate impressive effect sizes which partly diminish in subsequent research studies (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Griffin and Mahon (1997) have already called for research that looks at the CSP-CFP relation over time. To date, it is still an open question as to whether this is a time-independent relation. Scholars suggest that institutional investors increasingly focus on stakeholder issues (Borgers et al., 2013; Derwall et al., 2011). On account of learning effects and changes in investor values, these issues came into focus in recent years and subsequently the CSP-CFP relation – in this case measured as market-based CFP – diminished considerably since the mid-2000s. However, in meta-research on the CSP-CFP link, the evidence of a time dependency is not consistent. In their meta-analysis, Pavie and Filho (2008) show considerable effect size differences before and after 1998. Some discover no or only non-significant relations (Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Rubera & Kirca, 2012). Based on suggestions from primary studies and meta-analyses, we hypothesize about the moderating role of time:

H4a: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks over time.

# Sample Size

Hedges (1981) demonstrates that effect sizes for small samples are biased upward. Evidence from cumulative meta-analyses in different fields supports this finding and cautions that meta-analyses with a small number of subjects may overestimate effects (Ioannidis, Trikalinos, Ntzani, & Contopoulos-Ioannidis, 2003; Trikalinos et al., 2004). By using the number of included studies as a weighting factor, the calculation design of meta-analyses seeks to adjust for this circumstance. If the CSP-CFP relation was a statistical outlier, we would observe effect size differences depending on the study sample size. Initial observations of our sample based on the number of included primary studies in a meta-analysis and the corresponding meta-study overall effect size support such a conclusion. We therefore hypothesize:

H4b: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks with the growing number of primary studies in the meta-sample.

# The Role of the Studies’ Publishing Source

Orlitzky (2011) examines in a review of the 2003 data whether the empirical evidence on the CSP-CFP relation differs depending on the kind of publishing journal. The author finds that the average correlations in economics, finance, and accounting journals are less than half of the correlations published in social issues-oriented journals (SIM journals – social issues in management). The deviation is statistically significant. Allouche and Laroche (2005) reflect on their meta-analysis results by differentiating the publishing sources – business ethics journals, accounting journals, and management journals. They find no significant differences. In order to investigate the role of the publishing source for our sample, we follow a three-step approach. First, we differentiate between SIM and general management (GM) journals, similarly to Orlitzky (2011). Second, we classify the journals of our 25 meta-analyses according to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) classification standard [Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) subject categories]. Third, we take into consideration the JCR journal impact factor of the publishing journals for the meta-analyses in our sample. We expect that effect sizes will tend to be smaller in more rigorous journals (e.g. Aguinis, Beaty, Boik, & Pierce, 2005). We, thus, hypothesize:

DOI: 10.1002/csr

# Corporate social and financial performance

H4c: The CSP-CFP relation is distorted by the publication source; SIM and lower-impact journals report more positive outcomes.

# Methodological Quality

An analysis of meta-analyses in education research proposes that ‘there seems to be a particular tendency for smaller effect sizes to be associated with higher methodological quality’ (Tamim, Bernard, Borokhovski, Abrami, & Schmid, 2011, p. 14). However, the results were not significant. Based on nearly 200 meta-studies in management research, Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, Pierce, and Dalton (2011) find that methodological choices have very little impact on the overall effect sizes. Lipsey and Wilson (1993) reveal for 302 studies in psychology that effect sizes in meta-studies are not inflated by the inclusion of methodological weak studies. To create generalizable conclusions for the CSP-CFP debate, we build on Aguinis et al. (2011) and apply a methodological strength assessment. We hypothesize:

H4d: The CSP-CFP relation is independent of methodological choices.

# Methods and Data

The first comprehensive summary of meta-analyses was published at the beginning of the 1990s, aggregating the work of 302 meta-analyses (Lipsey & Wilson, 1993). Ever since then, various examples of how to aggregate existing research summaries have emerged (Ahn, Ames, & Myers, 2012; Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou, & Kern, 2012; Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Hattie, 2009; Peterson, 2001; D. Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003; Tamim et al., 2011; Wilson & Lipsey, 2001). The main challenges of second-order meta-analyses are the precise calculation of the second-order average effect and estimation of its sampling error. Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein (2009) already address these challenges, but only recently have sufficient statistical methods been provided.

This study uses Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method for second-order meta-analysis. A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of independent but methodologically comparable first-order meta-analyses. It enables better generalization across contexts with a tremendously larger sample size and enhanced meta-analytic moderating factor analyses. Conclusions can be derived not just from a fraction of available primary studies, but presumably with a sample close to a complete set of studies. The Schmidt and Oh (2013) second-order meta-analysis is an advancement of the psychometric first-order predecessor – the Hunter-Schmidt (2004), approach, which is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al., 2011).

Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method has two important advantages compared to other second-level meta-analytic approaches. First, their method determines how much variance across a set of comparable first-order meta-analyses is due to second-order sampling error. This can considerably reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows estimation of the true (non-artifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes. Second, the analysis enables the computation of reliability estimates for the first-order meta-analyses and, thus, allows us to produce a more accurate estimation of the true mean effect size in each first-order meta-analysis.

Schmidt and Oh (2013) present three approaches for second-order meta-analysis: bare-bones second-order meta-analysis; psychometric second-order meta-analysis with artifact distribution of first-order meta-analysis estimates; and psychometric second-order meta-analysis with individual corrected first-order meta-analysis estimates. Because of the high number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample using artifact distribution correction without correcting primary studies individually, we opted for the first two approaches to calculate our results. Both approaches vary in terms of the input data (uncorrected or attenuated correlations vis-à-vis corrected or disattenuated correlations), the weighting scheme of the first-order meta-analyses, and the calculation of the second-order mean effect size.1

1See Table 1 in Schmidt and Oh (2013, p. 210) for a technical summary of the three approaches.

Like the first-order meta-analytical predecessor methodology (Hunter et al., 1982; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004), second-order meta-analysis is also a fully random effect model.

# The Search Process

We included a CSP-CFP meta-analysis in our sample insofar the applied CSP definition of meta-analysis matched the CSP understanding expressed by Wood (2010) and Clarkson (1995). Wood (2010, p. 64) argued for ‘CSP as an overarching, multi-dimensional construct’ where vast literature on organizational culture, managerial decision-making, or employee relations practices ‘waits to be brought into the field of CSP’. Also, Clarkson (1995) outlined a diverse set of social and stakeholder issues. He included, for example, employee-related aspects like compensation/rewards, training and development, employment equity, and employee communication. We follow their line of reasoning and have also included meta-analyses beyond a narrow CSP focus. These are, for instance, CEP, ethical corporate governance, and broader employee-related aspects. We did not differentiate as to whether the motives for firm CSP were altruistic or strategic (Baron, 2001; J. W. McGuire, 1969; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). In terms of CFP, the studies needed to consider at least one of the following categories: accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk, or the performance of CSP mutual funds/indices. In cases where the entire meta-analysis was beyond this scope, we extracted only the relevant parts of the whole analysis. Meta-analyses with probit- or logit-correlations were excluded, as transformations to the r-family of correlations result in effect sizes with too large sampling errors. Non-standardized effects, which could not be classified as CSP-CFP sub-effects, were also disregarded for this second-order meta-analysis. Our cut-off date for study inclusion was December 2014. All studies needed to be available in electronic format.

Initially, we applied ancestry research, using widely cited meta- and review studies to extract their cited predecessor studies. The sample was subsequently extended with a forward search in Google Scholar looking for potentially relevant cross-references of so far unknown studies. After that, we performed searches in relevant databases and publisher sites: Academy of Management journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, and Wiley, and also searched for non-published manuscripts on Econbiz, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), and Social Science Research Network (SSRN). We used several search combinations and variations of the term ‘Corporate Social Performance’ including (corporate) sustainability, (corporate) social responsibility, (corporate) governance, (corporate) environmental performance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance. Of all database queries, we further processed the first 100 hits sorted by relevance. The raw data set of several thousand studies was first reduced for overlapping search hits, and second searched for keywords in the remaining results. We searched for meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. This yielded an overall raw sample of 149 working papers and studies which were analyzed in more detail by examining the abstract or full paper. Seventy-six studies were dropped in the next step, because they either did not contain a relevant CSP-CFP categorization or were single-study designs. The remaining studies were narrowed to the final sample of 25 studies by the exclusion of: (1) 47 narrative reviews and vote-count studies; and (2) meta-studies with non-transferable effect sizes and different paper versions. If different versions of meta-studies with comparable data sets were identified, the latest version remained in our sample. Our search was open to meta-analyses in all asset classes, but it was not possible to locate meta-studies that analyzed other objects than equities. Thus, published (primary) research of the CSP effect in corporate bonds, real estate, and private equity is not considered, as we could not yet identify dedicated meta-analyses.

# Sample

Our total sample consists of 25 meta-analyses which combined yield a gross number (n m) of 1,902 primary studies. It aggregates 4,507 separate effects (k m) and nearly a million observations (N m = 992,239) (Table 1). Apart from the meta-analytical summary effects, we obtained 129 CSP-CFP sub-effects of first-order meta-analyses, combining in total 2,387,215 observations. Besides the summary and sub-effects at the meta-level, we extracted all provided data at primary study level. Adjusted for overlapping studies and primary studies which either were not made.

transparent by the meta-analyses’ authors (n = 404) or needed manual corrections (n = 38), the final study sample comprises 1214 (n) unique studies. Manual corrections were necessary for author typing errors, different years (i.e. published vs unpublished version), or adding or changing ‘a’ or ‘b’ when two different studies of the same author team appeared in the same year. When retrieving the primary study information from the meta-studies, we coded it in a unique form as author1, author2, …, author i (year). For 45% of studies (n(1) = 551 primary studies), the first-order meta-analyses provided data about effect sizes. On the basis of this information, it was possible to calculate a conventional first-order meta-analysis (so-called second-order omnibus meta-analysis).

# Coding

Besides the basic identifier information: (1) we retrieved a variety of methodological information. This included the meta-analytical approach, the family of reported effect sizes, if and how corrections for sampling and measurement error were taken, and, finally which attenuation factors were used. (2) We collected the granularity of primary studies (transparency level of statistics, all effect sizes, N, k, and t-test). (3) Finally, we gathered all meta-analytical results for summary and sub-effects (effect sizes, attenuated and disattenuated variances, standard errors, credibility and confidence intervals, reliability information of dependent and independent variables, the overall reliability estimate, and results of the homogeneity test, significance tests, and Fail-Safe N analysis). If results for both fixed and random effects were reported, we selected the random effect. All transparent data in primary studies which were also included in a first-order meta-analysis were extracted (e.g. the study identifier and results like study size, effect size(s), and reliabilities). In some cases, rudimentary interpretation was needed. For these cases, two independent coders reviewed the context. The original inter-rater reliability was above 0.9.

# Independence Considerations

An important prerequisite for conducting a second-order meta-analysis is statistical independence of individual first-order meta-analyses. This would require that the primary studies or samples used in one first-order meta-analysis not be included in any of the other analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). In fact, it is a typical case for second-order meta-analyses that this assumption cannot completely be met. Scholars therefore suggest that minimizing the lack of independence might be the best that can be expected (Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Schmidt & Oh, 2013). Various simulation analyses support this approach and find negligible effects of statistical independence violations (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001; Romano & Kromrey, 2008; Tracz, Elmore, & Pohlmann, 1992).

Our approach for minimizing data dependency applied three steps: meta-analyses selection; average overlap assessment; and the elimination of overlapping studies as a robustness check. First, we selected only the most recent version of a study. We considered multiple contributions from single authors only if they had different research topics or reported different correlation coefficients for the same primary study (Orlitzky, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Second, we calculated for every meta-analysis with transparent primary studies the pair-wise overlap to each other. We determined an average overlap of 5.4% of one single meta-analysis to the rest with 78% of pairs having less than 5% overlap. Third, Wilson and Lipsey (2001) reduce disproportionate dependency in second-order meta-analysis by eliminating studies that have more than 25% primary studies in common with other meta-analyses. Thus, we eliminated all meta-analyses with more than 25% overlap to at least one other study. The results of an additional assessment to rule out distorting effects of a potential independence violation are reported in Table 6. We conclude that the level of average non-independence for this study appears small and we have no indication that it could distort effect sizes and variances significantly.

# Analysis and Statistical Models

We calculated summary effects in three alternative ways and also for various subgroups and moderating factors. First, we conducted a second-order omnibus meta-analysis with all primary studies in our meta-analyses sample which contained transparent data for effect sizes. Technically, this is a traditional psychometric first-order.

meta-analysis (Hunter et al., 1982; Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). So-called omnibus meta-analyses have the advantage of established calculation procedures from first-order meta-analysis. Moreover, such analyses yield the same grand mean estimate, provided that all else is equal. But they also suffer from shortcomings like typically scarce data transparency at primary study level and, most important, it is not possible to estimate second-order sampling error variance and correct for it (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). This omnibus meta-analysis, to our knowledge, constitutes the largest meta-analysis in the field hitherto, based on the number of included primary studies. It combines n (1) = 551 studies with N (1) = 152,437 observations retrieved from previous meta-analyses. We utilized this first-order meta-analysis to gain a more granular understanding of the CSP-CFP relation and its statistical variation at primary study level.

Second, we calculated a second-order meta-analysis combining all meta-analytical summary effects of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25).

Third, we aggregated all relevant sub-effects of these meta-analyses (m = 129) in various subgroups in order to derive more granular conclusions about the CSP-CFP relation. These sub-effects and their reliability measures provided the foundation for the calculation and correction of a second-order sampling error and the subsequent moderating factor analysis. Moreover, as part of the robustness checks, we analyzed the impact on results when changing from best-effort variances to simple variance estimates. Further documentation on the determination of effect sizes and variances, the correction for measurement error, and the assessment of heterogeneity is provided in online Supplementary Appendix SA.

# Adjusting for the Second-Order Sampling Error

The second-order sampling error is comparable to adjustments for first-order measurement error variance in psychometric meta-analysis. As measurement error is the random deviation of an observed score from a true score, so is the random deviation of first-order meta-effect sizes from its actual second-order average, the second-order sampling error. Thus, the function is comparable to measurement error (Schmidt & Oh, 2013):

bir = rpp bp̿

pi b + pb̿

where pir is the second-order sampling error adjusted for the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate and unreliability in the first-order meta-analytic results, rpp is the reliability of i first-order meta-analytic values, pi is the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate, and pb̿ is the second-order grand mean meta-analytic estimate. The reliability coefficient rpp is 1-ProVar, which is calculated as the ratio of b2/S2p σp where b2 σp is the estimate of the actual (non-artifactual) variance across the m-meta-analyses of the population mean-disattenuated correlations. This is the variance that remains after the variance for the second-order sampling error has been subtracted from the variance of mean-disattenuated correlations across the m-meta-analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013).

Adjustments for second-order sampling error are useful to reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and therefore produce more accurate estimations of the true mean effect size and (non-artifactual) variance in first-order meta-analyses. These figures are displayed in columns 6–13 of Table 4.

# Moderating Factors

For determining potential moderating factors, the data were split into two or, if necessary, into multiple subgroups. We calculated z-values to identify whether effect size differences among groups are significant. For assessing the potential time dependence of the CSP-CFP relation, we analyzed the effect sizes in dependence of the meta-study publication year and the average publication year of the primary study in each meta-analysis. To rule out a distortion.

of results from changing meta-analytic methods and correction factors over time, the relation was as well assessed on first-order level and in dependency of the publication year.

The number of primary studies in each meta-analysis and its repercussions for the correlation level were analyzed for evaluating the role of sample sizes. The influence of the publishing source was compared for SIM journals versus General Management (GM) journals based on Orlitzky’s (2011) categorization. Since definitions regarding what can be considered as a SIM or GM journal differ (AoM SIM Division, 2012), all publishing journals of the 25 meta-analyses were classified according to the Thomson Reuters’ JCR classification standard. The SSCI subject categories present in our sample (business, environmental studies, ethics, management, political science, and applied psychology) were used to alternatively differentiate the sample of meta-analyses. If a journal was listed in more than one SSCI category, the one where it ranks highest was selected. Furthermore, the JCR 5-Year Journal Impact Factors (2014), the annual citation frequency of the meta-analyses, and the deviation between working papers and published studies were evaluated.

Finally, effect size dependence on methodological quality was evaluated. The methodology quality assessment builds on Aguinis et al. (2011) and transferred those parts of Aguinis et al.’s 21 parameters which could be expressed as dichotomous and qualitative. All parameters which were applied multiple times (e.g. range restrictions) are summarized to one overarching parameter. For each of the parameter identifiable in a meta-study, the meta-study received a score of 1 (present) or 0 (not present). The condensed set contained 11 parameters and therefore yielded a maximum methodological quality score of 11. The total scores for the set of 25 meta-analyses range between 2 and 9.

# Addressing Publication Bias

A general concern of any meta-analysis is that research yielding no significant results remains unpublished (e.g. Dickersin, 2005). Rosenthal (1979) labelled this potential limitation as the file drawer problem, with reference to the many files that remain with the investigator and are not published by journals. We addressed this potential drawback by calculating the Fail-Safe N (or file drawer) statistic, a display of the Funnel Plot, and the inclusion of unpublished literature. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level (Rosenthal, 1979). Rosenthal suggested a tolerance level of 5n+10 for Fail-Safe N to be considered unlikely. The statistic was calculated for all summary and sub-effects. For a visual investigation of publication bias we included as well a funnel plot (Light & Pillemer, 1984; Sutton, 2009). It scatters the study size of a meta-analysis against the effect size. In our case the funnel plot displays all m = 129 sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p (Figure 1). The effects are symmetrically distributed around the underlying true effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). As such, we can exclude biases in the data. Furthermore, we applied the Egger test for publication bias, which tests for asymmetry of the funnel plot (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997). Moreover, we separated attenuated and disattenuated effects from unpublished studies and subgroup the results against published studies (Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). The proportion of these working papers within the total results was notably high. They contributed 28 of the 129 sub-effects. All checks revealed that the results are very likely not be affected by publication bias (Figure 1; Table 5).

# Robustness Checks

The empirical outcomes of this analysis can be considered as fairly robust for a number of reasons. First, we analyzed the impact of switching from our best-effort variances to simple variance estimates (calculation according to Equation 6 in Online Supplement). The results in Table 6 show that our best-effort variances are conservative estimates, which produce lower effect sizes and variances, in particular for disattenuated results. Second, we performed a sensitivity analysis (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Joo, 2013; Greenhouse & Iyengar, 2009) and recalculated all effects when leaving out the top 5% and bottom 5%, each for effect size and effect size variances. Third, to control for a potential bias through perceptual measures of CFP and CSP, the effects were recalculated by leaving out the complete sample of perceptual CFP and reputational CSP. The results of all three robustness checks indicate that the findings are not distorted by outliers (Table 6).

Figure 1. Funnel plot of meta-analyses’ sub-effects (m = 129) against disattenuated effect size.
Note: Figure 1 scatters the study size of the 129 meta-analysis sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p. Effects of published and unpublished studies are displayed separately. The intersection of the axes was moved to the simple average of disattenuated effect sizes (0.179). The effects are relatively symmetrically distributed around the average effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). The larger the number of effects k, the closer the effect sizes are expected to be around the population mean. Effect sizes of unpublished research do not indicate any suppression of unfavourable studies. Apart from a very few outliers, which are additionally accounted for in the Robustness Checks section, the sample is not distorted by publication bias. This visually derived conclusion is supported by the Egger test (Egger et al., 1997) with a calculated p-value for bias of 0.489. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

# Results

# The General CSP-CFP Relation

We find strong support for Hypothesis 1a. First, the second-order omnibus meta-analysis, which is technically a first-order meta-analysis with n (1) = 551 primary studies, reveals a highly significant (first-order) effect size of ð = 0.119 (Table 2). This number presents the weighted average correlation across all primary studies adjusted for sampling error. When we additionally adjust for meta-analytic artifacts (measurement error for the CSP and CFP figures), we find a disattenuated correlation of p = 0.169. The average effect is highly significant and different from zero. The 95% confidence intervals for this weighted average attenuated correlation range from 0.105 to 0.134 (0.150 to 0.189 for the disattenuated). The 95% credibility interval ranges from -0.206 to 0.444 (-0.284 to 0.624 for the disattenuated). The corresponding variance σ²p of 0.054 (Table 2) is fairly comparable to the simple average of

T. Busch and G. Friede disattenuated correlations in the meta-analyses in our sample of 0.042 (Table 1). The effects are very heterogeneous [Q(1) = 4733 to 9288 and I2 = 0.88 to 0.94].

Second, the aggregation of all summary effects of the meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25) uncovers effect sizes that are very similar to those in the sample of primary studies. We determine an attenuated correlation of r̿ = 0.108 and a disattenuated correlation of pb̿ = 0.150 (Table 3).

Third, the correlations change marginally when the sample of 129 sub-effects from the meta-analyses is aggregated (r̿ = 0.110, pb̿ = 0.157). But unlike effect sizes, (true) variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those in the omnibus analysis of primary studies. Second-level variances are only in the range of σb²r̿ = 0.001 to b2b̿ = 0.007 (Table 3). The 95% credibility interval for disattenuated sub-effects ranges from -0.001σp to 0.316. Moreover, in our second-order results, we cannot detect the large heterogeneity of effects anymore that was present in the primary studies. Q and I2 indicate homogeneous relations (Q = 11.4 to 75.5; I2 = 0.00; Table 3).

The third and preferred measure of heterogeneity for psychometric meta-analysis (1-ProVar) still indicates heterogeneity (0.96 to 0.97) – albeit in very small variances, which have low statistical power.

We conclude that all CSP-CFP summary effects, be it first or second order, are highly significant positive. Second-order level variances are furthermore very small with credibility intervals that only by a very thin margin include zero and with effect sizes that are relatively homogeneous.

With respect to Hypothesis 1b, the difference between prior CSP to subsequent CFP (ri = 0.090) vs prior CFP to subsequent CSP (r = 0.098) is small and non-significant (Table 4). We apply two layers of corrections to account for other artifacts besides first-order sampling error. Based on the first-order correction for other artifacts, the relation changes slightly (pbi = 0.128 vs pbi = 0.141). The additional correction for second-order sampling error reveals that the real grand mean correlation is marginally different (pbir = 0.130 vs pbir = 0.143). The difference between both groups fails, with a wide margin, any significance level. We, thus, can rule out that the slack resources hypothesis or the good management hypothesis yields significantly higher results. However, we find the strongest correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, which supports Hypothesis 1b that there is a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP. The mean correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, corrected for second-order sampling error, is pbir = 0.159, the highest of the group with the lowest variance.

# The Relation of Various CSP Dimensions and CFP

In line with Hypothesis 2a, we find that studies with social CSP reveal a higher relation (pb i focusing on environmental CSP (pb i = 0.151) (Table 4). However, this difference is small and fails statistical significance (p-value of the difference is 0.388). Thus, Hypothesis 2a is rejected. Opposite to a common notion in the literature, our findings propose that good CSP pays, whether social or environmental related.

Within CSP dimensions, CSP reputation yields the highest relation (pb i = 0.318). The difference to the group average of CSP measures of b̿p = 0.225 is significantly higher at the 99% level (z-value 2.66). However, when we adjust for the 0.80 reliability factor (Table 4, column 12), CSP reputation is marginally adjusted towards pbir = 0.299 to account for the second-order sampling error. Thus, we confirm Hypothesis 2b: reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP within the CSP dimensions.

CSP disclosure yields significantly lower correlations (pb i = 0.119) compared to the group average (b̿p = 0.225) at the 99% level (Table 4). On account of the high level of variance artifacts (1-ProVar = 0.58), an adjustment for the second-order sampling error reveals the final, potentially true, correlation level birp supported. Within CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP, including second-order sampling error.

# The Relation of CSP and Various CFP Categories

In line with Hypothesis 3a, perceptual performance yields – indeed, by some distance – the highest relation to CFP (pb i = 0.380) (Table 4). It deviates significantly at the 99% level from the CFP group average (p = 0.148), also adjusted for second-order sampling error (pb ir = 0.359). This finding clearly supports Hypothesis 3a: CSP has the strongest link to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.

Operational CFP exhibits the highest CSP-CFP relation within the group of objective CFP categories (pbi = 0.222) (Table 4). The deviation with the group average (b̿p = 0.148) is highly significant. Consideration of the second-order sampling error changes the result only negligibly (pb ir = 0.216). This clearly supports Hypothesis 3b.

Accounting-based measures of CFP are more highly correlated (pbi = 0.161) with CSP compared to other market-based measures: growth measures (pbi = 0.124), market-based CFP measures (pb i = 0.115), and risk measures (pb i = 0.062). Even though all these category results are significantly different from zero, market-based CFP and risk measures return significantly lower correlations compared to other CFP measures (Table 4). These findings support Hypothesis 3c.

In accordance with Hypothesis 3d, we obtain the lowest correlation of all CFP categories (b = 0.016) for CSP mutual funds. It is the only result within the CFP categories which is not significantly different from zero. Nonetheless, if we adjust for the low statistical reliability of the CSP mutual fund relation (1-ProVar = 0.00), a correction for the second-order sampling error towards the average group effect b̿p becomes necessary (outlined in Equation 1). The difference between pb i and pb ir of 0.132 could be a reflection of the overall ‘noise’ – whether statistically or capital markets induced. We, thus, support Hypothesis 3d and conclude that mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to other CFP categories. Figure 2 graphically summarizes the range and magnitude of the main effect sizes.

# Moderating Factors

Our initial assessment reveals that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes compared to older studies. Measured by either the meta-study publication year (pbi = 0.130 vs pbi = 0.216) or the average.

For the purpose of this second-order meta-analysis, we changed the algebraic sign for CFP risk for calculation reasons. The stated positive CSP/CFP risk correlation means in fact a reduced CFP risk with increased CSP.

Note: Unless otherwise stated, the subgroup H1 represents results greater than the respective average of the selected moderating factor. H2 represents the subgroup below the subgroup average. z ri and z pb i are the corresponding z-values for the subgroup means. The additional index (1) indicates the first-order level. See text for abbreviations. The significance values are: *p &lt; 0.10; **p &lt; 0.05; and ***p &lt; 0.01.

publication year of the primary studies in each meta-analysis (pb i = 0.132 vs pbi = 0.194), the results indicate that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes (Table 5). However, the attenuation factors applied by the first-order meta-analytical reviewers for these two groups differ considerably. Relatively older meta-analyses used on average an attenuation factor of 0.66 in comparison to younger analyses (0.78). We also assess the relation on first-order level with data on 551 primary studies to rule out a distortion of initial results from changing meta-analytical methods and correction factors over time. This verification uncovers that the pattern of a correlation-level shrink is no longer observable as the differences in r 1 ð ) and p( ) do not exist anymore (0.002 and b 1 -0.002). Based on this extensive set of primary studies that avoids potential distortions through different meta-analytical attenuation factors, Hypothesis 4a cannot be confirmed.

When separating our meta-analytical results into dichotomous groups depending on the number of underlying studies (n), we retrieve two summary effects that are marginally and insignificantly different from each other. Larger studies tend to be negligibly weaker in effect size (pb i = 0.153) in comparison to smaller studies (pbi = 0.160). We conclude that the CSP-CFP relation is not dependent on the study sample size as the difference is non-significant. Larger studies in our sample produce equally strong relations compared to smaller samples which can be interpreted as another sign of the stability of the CSP-CFP relation. Thus, we reject Hypothesis 4b.

As no meta-study in our sample was published in an economics, finance, or accounting journal, we are limited to sub-effects in SIM journals and GM journals. We determine, in contrast to findings at primary study level, even significant lower effect sizes of meta-analyses in SIM journals (p = 0.115) compared to GM journals (pb i = 0.174). These are interesting findings since prior research proposed the opposite. Working paper studies exhibit attenuated effect sizes comparable with those in published papers (r i = 0.115) but disattenuated effect sizes deviate significantly from those in published papers (pbi = 0.186 vs 0.152). Moreover, we find that higher-impact factor journals (factor 5.1 on average for the sample) produce significantly higher correlations than lower-impact factor journals (pb i = 0.177 vs pbi = 0.127).

frequently cited (per annum basis) meta-analyses exhibit very similar effect sizes compared to less often-cited ones. All these findings clearly reject Hypothesis 4c. There is no upwardly distorted CSP-CFP relation through SIM or lower-impact journals.

Finally, regarding the role of judgmental decisions in meta-analyses techniques and methodological choices, we find virtually no difference in effect sizes for methodological stronger (pb i = 0.161) and weaker studies (pb i = 0.153). This finding supports Hypothesis 4d. The CSP-CFP relation exists regardless of the methodological sophistication in meta-analyses. Furthermore, the results of the additional robustness tests suggest that the results are not distorted by statistical outliers (Table 6).

# Discussion and Conclusion

This study makes several contributions to the academic inquiry on whether it pays to be a good firm. First, we are able to claim with more confidence than before that a highly significant, positive, and bidirectional CSP-CFP relation exists. The findings are robust at first-order and, in particular, at second-order meta-analytical level and do not change when we consider potential publication bias, apply less conservative variances, or conduct sensitivity analyses. True variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those at first-order level. Thus, the resulting credibility interval is much narrower, with a lower bound virtually at zero (m = 129). We are therefore safely able to claim that in 95% of cases we observe a positive average effect in meta-studies on the CSP-CFP relation. We find no indication that either CSP or CFP matters more from a cause–effect point of view. All three underlying theories (slack resources, good management, and virtuous circle) can empirically be defended. However, the level of effect sizes for a bidirectional relation is highest at the lowest variability of the effects. This leads us to acknowledge the virtuous circle theory as the most probable. To date, the academic CSP-CFP debate is often coined by the notions of ‘contradictory’, ‘mixed’, or ‘ambiguous’ findings. We propose that the business case for CSP can be considered well proved. Research designs taking into account non-linear CSP-CFP relations may even further increase the explanatory power of the CSP-CFP relation (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; Gao, Wu, & Hafsi, 2017; Trumpp & Guenther, 2017; Wagner, Van Phu, Azomahou, & Wehrmeyer, 2002).

Second, we shed light on an academically well-established misinterpretation. We cannot detect statistically significant differences between the effects of environmental and social-related CSP on CFP. This outcome is in contrast to several empirical studies and conceptions which consider social aspects as the main driver for CFP. Our findings propose a different result: good CSP pays off, whether social or environmental related. The difference between both is not statistically significant. This result mirrors S. L. Hart’s (1995) idea of a natural resource-based view and supports other empiric evidence for the business case of improving CEP (Albertini, 2013; Berchicci & King, 2007; Etzion, 2007). It may also be a way for revitalizing the resource-based view (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011) to acknowledge environmental- and social-related aspects as equally relevant sources for companies’ success.

Third, within CSP dimensions, it is possible to identify different sources for a business case. The strongest relation to CFP is identified for CSP reputation. The intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate and potentially the most overarching outcome measure for CSP, leads to sustained superior financial profit (Melo & Garrido-Morgado, 2012; P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002; Sabate & Puente, 2003). On the other hand, the strong correlation for CSP philanthropy reiterates that instrumental and moral initiatives can supplement each other (Brammer & Millington, 2008; Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, 2016). CSP disclosure as well as CSP audits, processes, and policies are significantly weaker correlations compared to the rest of the CSP dimensions. The limited standardization of CSP disclosure practices (Busch, Bauer, & Orlitzky, 2016) seems, in fact, to encourage companies to provide primarily beneficial rather than unbiased CSP information (Schultze & Trommer, 2012; Ullmann, 1985). The significantly weaker correlation of CSP disclosure may point to reliability and validity issues of CSP data. One way of overcoming such data limitations can be to strengthen efforts toward a more stringent – and maybe even obligatory – extra-financial data disclosure. Standardization efforts of the Sustainable Accountings Standards Board (SASB, 2015) and the European Union (EU, 2014) are promising steps forward in this regard.

# Corporate social and financial performance

Fourth, our findings suggest that operational performance is significantly and more highly correlated to CSP than other CFP categories. This finding mirrors other researchers’ claims that operational performance such as productivity is located closer to the value creation source within a firm; it better reflects organizational performance than potentially distorted CFP categories like accounting- or market-based measures (McWilliams et al., 1999; Peloza, 2009; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986).

Fifth, it is an interesting phenomenon that correlations shrink for different CFP categories – perceptual performance having the highest correlation and CSP mutual funds the lowest. The closer research gets to realized market performance, the smaller the effects. Several reasons may explain why empirical studies on CSP mutual funds exhibit a relatively weak CSP-CFP relation. Realized performance in mutual funds depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, & Xu, 2001; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009), construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, & Thorley, 2002), and costs for portfolio implementation which can be as high as 2.5% per annum in various fees that are carried by the average mutual fund (Barber, Odean, & Zheng, 2005; Carhart, 1997; Khorana, Servaes, & Tufano, 2009). The ‘drowned out by other noise’ argument (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527) thus seems to be even more valid for mutual funds, which are the ultimate amalgam of market-based measures. Nevertheless, in the worst case, mutual funds investors could expect to lose nothing compared to conventional mutual fund investments.

Sixth, we expected that early published analyses would show greater effect sizes compared with subsequently published meta-analyses. This potential diminishing effect over time as data accumulate is well documented (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Indeed, we find significantly lower correlations for more recent meta-studies compared to older studies. However, the additional analysis at primary study level (n = 551) revealed that the shrinkage in correlations in the meta-analyses most likely does not indicate a shrinkage of the actual CSP-CFP relation. Correlations at primary study level, in contrast to our findings at the meta-study level, do not shrink. One explanation for this finding is that more recent meta-analytical research methods have become more sophisticated though using higher attenuation factors.

Finally, there was the suspicion raised that evidence of the CSP-CFP relation depends on the kind of publishing journal. The speculation was that SIM journals tend to publish ‘better results’. Interestingly, we find the opposite result: ‘truth is not made’ in special SIM journals and low-impact factor journals, but rather, in particular, in high-impact factor and general management journals, at least at a meta-analysis level. We did not discover any publication bias analyzed by Fail Safe, funnel plot, or with regards to the publishing status of a paper. In line with previous findings (Aguinis et al., 2011; Lipsey & Wilson, 1993), we also reveal that the methodological quality of meta-analyses has no influence on the reported effect sizes.

Concluding, this study takes an instrumental point of view: we ask whether it pays to be good and find that in fact it does. In light of the urgent global challenges that society faces, it appears essential that firms and investors consider any action possible to safeguard the living conditions for future generations. They can be encouraged that on first glance competing instrumental and moral motivations can supplement each other.

# Abstract

Corporate sustainability is considered a fundamental paradigm and solution in creating a prosperous future for organizations. However, social sustainability issues and pandemic problems from COVID-19 have affected corporations and interrupted plans for sustainable development. To date, corporate sustainability frameworks have taken a relatively narrow view of this paradigm. This study highlights serious challenges to corporate sustainability while providing a framework in an attempt to enable more sustainable business practices. To fill the gap in the literature, we have developed a framework to organize and prioritize important sustainability indicators. The first phase of the study involves the classification of 45 sub-criteria of corporate sustainability under nine main categories by using a literature review and novel Fuzzy Delphi method. The resulting categories are Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economic, Environmental, Social, Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, Energy Consumption along with Energy Saving, and includes Pandemic COVID-19 as a new aspect of social sustainability. Next, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to help determine the weights and prioritizing the criteria and sub-criteria. The results revealed that the Pandemic, along with the Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, ranked higher among the main criteria category. Whereas, emergency response planning, social distances, modification of working hours, and just-in-time delivery are the most influencing sub-attributes among the 45 sub-barriers of different categories. Contributions of this study include new insights regarding corporate sustainability criteria and subcriteria, application of novel methods, and integrated framework for dimensions of corporate sustainability. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an essential category and social sustainability attribute of corporate sustainable business practices. Outcomes of this study can help assist scholars, corporations, and decision-makers in understanding sustainable development initiatives while simultaneously improving social sustainability practices.

# 1. Introduction

Sustainable development is the potential to fulfill today’s needs without undermining a future generation’s ability to satisfy their needs[1]. Sustainability has become a significant alternative to business as usual, which appears to focus primarily on short-term productivity with little or no social and environmental impacts considered over the long term[2]. Despite this, the business environment.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747; doi:10.3390/su12208747 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

is changing rapidly, guided by social, economic, and ecological developments [3, 4]. For these and other aligned reasons, companies have become increasingly interested in corporate sustainability; see, for example, Christ et al. [5] and Manrique and Martí-Ballester [6]. While managers have noticed that the integration of sustainability is an opportunity, they rarely consider it in tactical management decisions [7]. The consideration of sustainability in corporate strategy and processes has become one promising way of dealing with a changing business landscape and increasing pressure for social sustainability performance. Since decisions relating to sustainability are made at a strategic level, there has also been an increasing scientific interest in the field of strategic management in connection with the inclusion of sustainability in the strategy, vision, change management, and culture of a company [8].

Due to the variety of different sustainability initiatives, there is an ongoing opportunity for researchers to quantify what ongoing and emerging practices look like [9]. Yet, there has been so much published by researchers that it can be an overwhelming amount of information to sort through. Add to this, the idea that stakeholders are continually seeking more information beyond financial performance by wanting to see the ecological and social policies of a company [10], and the importance of understanding corporate sustainability continues to grow. Corporate sustainability reporting can be a primary motivation for organizations to communicate with stakeholders about sustainability initiatives. This gets difficult due to the terminology and growing categories of these diverse efforts. For example, firms have been reporting the use of different terminologies, e.g., corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainable development (SD), economic and non-economic reporting, and referring to the main pillars of sustainability which are social, environmental, and economic (SEE), and triple bottom line (TBL). The evolution of such reporting is fascinating. Tschopp and Huefner [11] found that the companies were focusing on environmental management compliance reporting during the 1970s and 1980s, and they also observed a weak relation between sustainability reporting and organization performance. Later, in the 1990s, sustainability reporting on occupational health and safety (OHS) was observed, and a paradigm shift to reporting on societal-based activities, accompanied by institutionalization.

Considering that each participant in society has its unique responsibility to engage sustainable development at a global scale, corporate sustainability reflects the organizations’ part to global challenges of sustainable development [12], including depletion of natural resources and social sustainability. There are several challenges regarding corporate sustainability, such as the need for considering both external and internal stakeholders in corporate decisions [13]; to resolve discrepancies, contradictions, and synergies among the three pillars of TBL sustainability [14]; to promote an approach to corporate sustainability based in moral-values [15]; to foster corporate social responsibility across the business life-cycle thinking [16]. Add to this, the several contributions available in the literature from different epistemological fields connected with environmental, economic, and social performance, and it seems evident that there is an absence of coordination among them. Diouf et al. [17] emphasized the growing significance of sustainability reporting and the use of international regulations, targets for reducing carbon emissions, and international standards and guidelines. Arribas et al. [18] investigated that the inclusion of irresponsible companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) from S&P Dow Jones Indices, and Social Accountability (SA8000) from Social Accountability International—SAI (2008) is a fact.

Those who manage business decisions face multiple criteria for achieving the best practices while trying to achieve multiple goals. Decisions regarding sustainable business practices have multi-level characteristics as TBL dimensions can be broken down into hierarchical variables [19]. One primary objective of this study is to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria. Therefore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is recommended for simultaneously addressing decisions with multiple objectives and multiple criteria. Multi-criteria decision theory helps to orchestrate the various awareness of practices involving sustainability [20] and to help when making decisions regarding dynamic topics. Multi-stakeholder, multi-objective, and multi-level frameworks have been developed and utilized in the literature to assess corporate sustainability results but, so far,

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

the initiatives have not provided a consistent, single measure capturing the TBL’s complexities and integrating the MCDA. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to provide a methodology to help organize and understand this dynamic context for sustainable business practices.

Add to this dynamic context, a global pandemic and things can get interesting. Due to the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, the modern world is suffering a global economic crisis with well over 9 million cases, and over 501,000 fatalities as of September 2020 affecting more than 200 countries [21]. Many businesses have shut down, and the rate of unemployment has increased. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has become an unparalleled global crisis and is challenging organizations, which ultimately can have a negative effect on corporate sustainability and business practices [22]. Until now, corporations have not had to plan for a pandemic. Moreover, corporate sustainability has been marginalized due to organizations, governments, and society struggling to survive in times of a pandemic. Researchers have stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is opening new challenges for corporate sustainability, mainly because supply chains and their manufacturers are facing the pandemic’s negative effects, such as market downturn, SMEs bankruptcy, employees’ resignations, revenue loss, to name a few. Therefore, we see the post-COVID-19 era as an opportunity by which organizations can rethink their sustainable business practices concerning a shift in their manufacturing, supply chain, and sustainability strategies. Here we find the third objective for this study to extend our understanding of corporate sustainability by also exploring the more recent impacts of the pandemic.

Researchers, policymakers, and decision-makers are now more concerned about how to make corporations more sustainable. This study is an attempt to help decision-makers and researchers by developing a framework for corporations regarding social sustainability dimensions that include COVID-19 as a new attribute of sustainable business practices. Many aspects of corporate sustainability can be measured to calculate the company’s sustainability efficiency. In this study of corporate sustainability, we assess this paradigm using (i) Governance; (ii) Product Responsibility; (iii) Transparency and Communication; (iv) Economic; (v) Environmental; (vi) Social; (vii) Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability; (viii) Energy Consumption and Saving, and a new criterion, (ix) Pandemic COVID-19. These nine aspects are further divided into forty-five sub-criteria. In doing so, one contribution of this study is the addition of values for these major criteria and sub-criteria as we attempt to fill a gap in the corporate sustainability literature. As a partial response to the recent and growing call for understanding the pandemic COVID-19 effects on businesses, the authors conducted this research aiming to contribute to the growing literature on the topic by developing a multidimensional framework for corporate sustainability. Further, this study prioritizes the main and sub-attributes of an emerging sustainability model by being among the first to use MCDA techniques.

To help start us down a path to understanding this dynamic context for corporate sustainability, fundamental factors can be identified from the literature and further classified as a foundation for understanding corporate sustainability. In this study, we draw from the literature to develop lists of main and sub-attributes essential for developing corporate sustainability business practices. Building on our objectives for this study, our primary research questions include, but are not limited, to what are the most influenceable metrics for corporate sustainability? And how can they be evaluated and ranked in a way that provide value to practitioners and scholars? After reviewing the literature, conceptual models, our research framework, and applying a Fuzzy Delphi method, we assess nine sustainability criteria and forty-five sub-criteria. We review our methods for employing the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) for calculations of weights for both the sub-criteria using a matrix of pairwise comparisons. Results are then discussed, and the last section provides main conclusions, contributions to the field, and avenues for aspects of corporate sustainability, social sustainability, and sustainable development for future researches.

# 2. Literature Review

The definitions of sustainability have many interpretations, such as environmental protection, ecosystem resources, economic concerns, social acceptance, licensing and externalities, and many other perspectives. The recent literature shows that sustainable development is going beyond “green” to a more comprehensive, systematic, methodological, and integrated understanding of sustainability.

Researchers and decision-makers are aware of the need for systematic sustainability assessments to evaluate complex systems to replace traditional and unsustainable business practices. Such assessments ultimately concentrate on historical strategies for sustainability, demonstrating the need to improve corporate sustainability programs over time, along with allocating resources that reduce sustainability risks. Further, organizations need to combine efficiency and market performance initiatives to develop strategic corporate sustainability opportunities [23].

Asif et al. [24], conceptualized the integration of economic, social, and environmental bottom lines dimension by using a triple bottom line. This view of a corporation means that the efficiency and sustainability aspects of the integrated structure are matched together. Several models have been proposed to develop corporate sustainability in efforts to make it accessible, practical, and quantifiable. The wide range of sustainability frameworks is because of the variety of definitions of sustainable development, i.e. ecological sustainability, environmental efficiency, corporate citizenship, and TBL.

In prior studies, one dimension of corporate sustainability is evaluated to define, measure, and sometimes test constructs and relationships. For instance, environmental sustainability frameworks concentrate on environmental issues by providing metrics for mitigating pollution, climate vulnerability, environmental degradation, land use, and loss of biodiversity [25]. Social sustainability models focus on societal and ethical facets of corporate sustainability, such as infrastructure, community welfare, human rights, health, equity, and education [26]. Further, economic sustainability involves the economic structure of organizations and concentrates on businesses seeking to optimize the company’s resources through social and environmental strategies [27]. Some studies proposed the two-dimensional sustainability frameworks in which two or more dimensions of corporate sustainability (such as environmental and social dimensions evaluated by providing sustainability indices and MCDA approaches). The fundamental model of corporate sustainability is shown in Figure 1.

Concerns regarding the social and environmental effects of sustainability must be weighted, but economic viability should not be threatened. The company’s financial performance can be affected and impacts its risk of survival if it fails to give due attention to its economic performance [28]. Longoni and Cagliano [29] argued that managing and balancing TBL performance is paramount. The authors acknowledge the difficulties of doing this while also trying to understand any negative tradeoffs between the three sustainability dimensions.

The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) systems assist companies in integrating sustainable development and TBL performance. GRI measures and reports the “material” performance of companies and its business activities and its effectiveness in multiple dimensions, i.e., three folds result to the public, most of the time through sustainability reports [30]. Several sustainability indices have been developed to highlight sustainability activities so that investors can consider the sustainable performance of enterprises. By analyzing the sustainability practices by each corporation, the sustainability indices act as a knowledge intermediary of companies with their different players (including business specialists, shareholders, and financial intermediaries). Specialized data accessed by neutral parties are seen by these intermediaries as objective. Conventional definitions of sustainability suggest that the businesses are supposed to be listed only if they are more socially and environmentally responsible than their competitors within these stock indexes. Sustainability stock indexes can, therefore, be treated as suitable sustainability performance indicators. Weber [31] suggests sustainability guidance that describes the most relevant performance metrics and issues in six banking industries. They showed specific important issues are shared by many industries, particularly social sustainability aspects, whereas others are unique in a sector.

Several researchers have used MCDA methods to measure the company’s sustainability performance. A list of different MCDA approaches used to develop a sustainability framework is shown in Table 1.

Previously, before the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations, governments, and society were dealing with and focusing on environmental issues. It is believed that, after the COVID-19 pandemic, business transitions will increase in order to achieve a more sustainable corporate sustainability. This transition will allow organizations to develop flexible manufacturing systems, prioritizing environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Regarding decision support systems for resilient production, there are various options available, such as those proposed by Tan et al. [52] and the prediction model for supply chains of Ivanov et al. [53]. Thus, companies and supply chains need to be resilient to tackle tough times, such as what occurs during the current pandemic.

As expected, the economic crisis that followed the COVID-19 epidemic affected several businesses, from manufacturers to service providers due to the social distancing and lockdowns [54]. Thus, the businesses in which customers interact with each other were immediately stopped [55, 56]. To avoid bankruptcy, these businesses moved to palliative solutions aiming for their survival, mainly migrating the businesses to digital platforms [57].

The epidemic effects on delivery delays are affecting supply chains, causing bullwhip effects, and unbalancing organizations’ performances in almost all industries. Thus, companies are focusing on essential items for manufacturing and maintaining supply activities regarding the unexpected disruptions. At the same time, these organizations are planning how to restart the businesses close to the ‘new normal’, as society is returning to (a semi) normality.

The main justification for considering the COVID-19 pandemic effects in corporate sustainability, within this study, is that its consequences will be felt for decades [58]. Thus, as a long-lasting event, it is assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect organizations regarding their sustainability actions in the future.

We considered various decision attributes and indicators for the development of a multidimensional sustainability framework. These attributes can assist in the construction of an effective corporate sustainability model while also providing insights into sustainable business practices. This study develops a decision criterion for sustainable development based on the literature and then checked the criteria validity provided by key expert’s contributions. The main sustainability criteria in our development of a sustainability framework include Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economics, Social, Environmental, Natural Environmental and Climate Change, Energy Saving and Consumption, and what we believe to be used for the first time, the COVID-19 pandemic criteria. As per the best of the authors’ knowledge, pandemic impacts have not been used before in sustainability models to date, the consideration of COVID-19 pandemic effects will help to fulfill a gap in the literature.

Each of these sustainability criteria has a total of forty-five sub-criteria. These criteria were identified after reviewing and summarizing the literature. The results of which criteria and sub-criteria are shown in Table 2. Next, we attempt to extend the corporate sustainability model based on the ‘Plan, Do, Check, and Act’ (PDCA) approach, as presented in Figure 2.

# 3. Research Framework

We have used the Fuzzy Delphi, and FAHP approaches to finalize and prioritize the most important criteria and select sustainability options for the development of corporate sustainability. The framework operationalized in this study is shown in Figure 3. Fuzzy Delphi proposed by Hsu et al. [88] has been adopted in this study to finalize corporate sustainability criteria. The advantage of Fuzzy Delphi over the conventional Delphi method is that the latter is a lengthy process of obtaining a consensus on experts’ opinions. The expert’s opinion in the conventional Delphi method often suffers from low convergence, which ultimately complicates consensus-building. The experts are therefore consulted repeatedly to reform their feedback so that a possible consensus can be reached. On the other hand, Fuzzy Delphi can obtain experts’ consensus through only one round of investigation [89]. The Fuzzy Delphi uses membership functions to characterize the experts’ feedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.

Regarding the development of the fuzzy membership degrees, most of the previous studies used a Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN), Gaussian fuzzy number, and trapezoidal fuzzy number [88]. This study employs TFNs, to construct the membership degree function. To find the converging point of the decision group, TFNs were solved using the geometric mean following previous studies such as [90,91]. In taking this approach, a FAHP methodology was used for computing the weights of the main and sub-attributes of corporate sustainability, supported by decision-makers, using a pairwise comparison matrix. To carry out the analysis, eight academic and industrial experts were involved whose detail is provided in Appendix A (see Table A1).

feedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.

# Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process

The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a well-known and adaptable Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to solve complex problems used across a variety of fields of research. The logic of AHP is based on a ratio scale to quantify the different sets of alternatives priorities provided by decision-makers [92]. This approach evaluates the consistency and importance of the decision-makers’ instinctive opinions to provide an optimal solution for complex problems. Researchers have integrated the AHP approach with other methods, such as grey system theory, data analysis envelopment, fuzzy system theory, and even linear programming [93].

Although AHP methods have shown satisfactory results and can be used to evaluate decision-makers’ opinions, this technique has some deficiencies in terms of human behavior and thinking approach. Hence, the traditional method has some limitations, such as (i) handling with the inconsistent and unbalanced expert opinion scale, (ii) unable to handle the uncertain and ambiguous relationship with expert’s judgment numbers, (iii) imprecise results, and (iv) decision-makers’ subjective opinion preferences.

Due to these limitations, AHP has evolved into FAHP, as a widely used and more accurate approach over conventional methods to solve uncertain and complex problems involving a decision-maker’s judgment. FAHP is the combination of traditional AHP and Fuzzy set theory, where the membership of each element is represented by a function. Further, each element of the membership function is divided into the membership’s degree with a value between 0 and 1, which implies that any membership’s element has a value of “1”. Conversely, any element has no membership with a “0” value. Those elements which lie between “0 and 1” have a partial or incomplete degree of membership [94]. To effectively handle the uncertainties during the logistic estimation process, there is a need to convert the linguistic term of membership function into ‘fuzzy numbers’, meanwhile, in FAHP, linguistic values are shown as a TFN.

To develop corporate sustainability for the purposes of this study, FAHP was applied to estimate weights of criteria and sub-criteria in the six following steps:

1. Designing the problem structure using a hierarchical approach
2. Constructing of pairwise comparison matrix and developing the scale of the relative importance

After designing the problem structure in a hierarchical way, the next step is to define the scale of relative importance in order to construct a pairwise comparison matrix. Table 3 presents the TFN, which are from 1 to 9, and are used to improve the accuracy of the traditional model. We employed (˜ 3, 5, 7, 9) relative to correspondence number for expert qualitative assessment in five TFNs in order to capture the vagueness and remove uncertainties. The fuzzy membership for attributes and sub-attributes is shown in Figure 4.

# Step III. Constructing a fuzzy-based matrix for comparison purposes

Experts used the TFNs to elaborate pairwise comparisons of corporate sustainability main and sub-attributes. The fuzzy comparison matrix X was drawn from the expert’s opinions by using the arithmetic mean function for pairwise comparison, as presented in Equation (1).

|∼|…|b1n|
|---|---|---|
|∼|…|b12|
|∼|…|…|
|X =|…|…|

where b∼ij = 1, if i = j, and b∼ij = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1, if i ≠ j. To calculate the scores for a pair, a reverse comparison was applied in the matrix for giving a reciprocal score.

# Step IV. Developing the crisp comparison matrix Xij

To make the expert and decision-makers judgments more confident, the α-cut method can be used through the ranking of fuzzy numbers, in which it provides an interval of values based on fuzzy numbers. Figure 5 presented the α-cut method on TFN for this instance, if α = 0.5 will yield a0.5 = (2, 3, 4).

# 4. Results and Discussion

This research used multiple methods to develop a corporate sustainability framework that assists policymakers, government, decision-makers, and managers, to effectively develop sustainability and make better decisions in implementing sustainable business practices. This study is the first of its kind to develop a multidimensional corporate sustainability model based on important sustainability indicators that include pandemic information due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, this study identifies and assesses valuable sustainability options retrieved from literature and experts’ knowledge to provide the most suitable sustainability practices for making corporate sustainability resilient. Our investigation is a roadmap for organizations and policymakers in the contemporary world aiming to determine further applications based on our findings, which provides a more rational solution for the development of corporate sustainability.

# 4.1. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process Results

Our analysis started by using the FAHP method based on a pairwise comparison matrix. This matrix was built for determining individual expert scores through a geometric mean approach. The group-based decision-making approach was adopted for calculations of sustainability attributes and sub-attributes weights. Supported by experts and analyzing the related literature review, we can classify nine main sustainability attributes, i.e., Corporate Governance, Environment, Social, Economic, Product Responsibility, Natural Environment and Climate, Energy Consumption and Saving, Transparency and Communication, and COVID-19 pandemic. The first phase of the FAHP method comprises the calculation of the nine most important criteria’s weights and, at the second stage, we determined the 45 sub-attributes weights in total. Figure 6 presents the hierarchal structure of corporate sustainability with the main attributes and sub-attributes.

# 4.2. Prioritizing Main Attributes

The FAHP computed the weight of each sustainability attribute in a hierarchical structure. The main attributes are presented in Table 5 and reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic is the most important criteria by obtaining the highest weight of 0.4129. The importance of criteria were as follows: Economic (0.3754), Corporate Governance (0.2532), Natural Environment and Climate (0.2195),

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Environmental (ENV), Energy Consumption and Saving (0.1775), Transparency and Communication (0.1210), Social (0.0542), and Product Responsibility (0.0492) criteria, respectively. The details of each main sustainability indicator’s weights are presented in Table 5. The rapid spreading of the pandemic involving COVID-19 is the most influential barrier disrupting corporate sustainability. The pandemic has affected overall business performances. Economic sustainability and governance was the second most important indicator in our analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects, it brings new challenges for corporations to affect their ability to operationalize sustainability. In addition to new compliance and regulatory parameters, it appears to be a mandatory part of corporate sustainability in the organization. Therefore, corporations need to develop a corporate sustainability system in order to cope with these new issues and enable more sustainable business practices.

# Table 5. Main corporate sustainability attributes.

|Main Criteria|Code|Weight|Rank|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pandemic|PEN|0.4129|1st|
|Corporate Governance|CGOV|0.2532|3rd|
|Product Responsibility|PR|0.0492|9th|
|Transparency and Communication|TC|0.1210|7th|
|Economic|EC|0.3754|2nd|
|Environmental|ENV|0.1871|5th|
|Social|SOC|0.0542|8th|
|Natural Environment & Climate|NEC|0.2195|4th|
|Energy Consumption and Saving|ECS|0.1775|6th|

According to the calculation of the main sustainability attributes’ weights, the Pandemic attribute came first in the main corporate sustainability criteria. To this end, organizations should develop an emergency response plan to tackle any emergency, which may become a hurdle in the effective implementation of corporate sustainability. Hence, organizations should develop a sustainable structure that can prevent the organization from crises. Moreover, organizations should also implement suitable and long-lasting sustainability practices that assure optimal progress toward sustainability and provide benefits while utilizing scarce resources. Further, it was observed that the delivery time of goods supplies has been drastically disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, organizations need to develop a sustainable delivery system like just-in-time (JIT), which provides a more resilient solution during any emergency faced by the organization. Economic sustainability, governance, and natural environment and climate took their position after the pandemic attribute. Whereas product responsibility came last and observed the least essential attributes by obtaining the lowest weight (0.0492). The 45 sub-attributes of the study were evaluated through with the help of expert’s opinion, according to the pairwise comparisons matrix.

# The Prioritizing of Sub-Attributes

The ranking of sub-attributes of corporate sustainability is presented in Figures 7–15.

# Governance sub-attributes:

We identified the sub-attributes ranking (GOV) as following:

GOV4 > GOV1 > GOV3 > GOV7 > GOV5 > GOV2 > GOV6.

Management and audit of corporate governance (GOV4) obtained the highest score (0.4132) and is considered the main influencing sub-attribute of its category. The outcome proved that face validity is an accurate justification as audit expertise, then skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions.

# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses must address governance and strengthening it since governance is responsible for guiding companies towards sustainability. Another high score observed with sub-criteria in this category is the corporate governance report (GOV1), with a weight of 0.3884. Corporate award and recognition (GOV3) showed a score of 0.3732, standing at the top-three most important sub-criteria of this category (as seen in Figure 7). Investors are evaluating both economic and financial returns on investments (ROI), but the valuation of investees' reputation is increasing. Then, reputation is positively influenced by corporate sustainability governance at high standards (Gottschalk, 2011). Public Private Partnership on sustainability (GOV7) received a score of 0.2351, putting this sub-attribute at the fourth position of most important sub-attributes. Moreover, corporate governance accountability (GOV5) showed a score of 0.1717, being the fifth most important sub-attribute in this category. The structure and dynamics of corporate governance (GOV2) and conduct and conflict of interest in corporate governance (GOV6) are the least influencing sub-criteria, obtaining the weights of 0.1653 and 0.1089, respectively. The decision for a given company for engaging corporate sustainability governance depends on the achievements of the corporate goals. In this way, [97] underlined that a company’s sustainability is influenced by the stakeholder’s sustainability. Additionally, relations with stakeholders must be considered key for decision-making processes which, in turn, support the establishment of corporate strategies.

|Conflict of interest in corporate governance-GOV6|0.1089|
|---|---|
|Structure and dynamics of corporate governance-GOV2|0.1653|
|Corporate governance accountability-GOV5|0.1717|
|Public Private Partnership on sustainability-GOV7|0.2351|

|Corporate governance report-GOV1|0.3884|
|Management and audit of corporate governance-GOV4|0.4132|

Figure 7. Governance Sub-criteria.

# Product Responsibility

Under the Product responsibility (PR) category, we obtained the following sub-criteria ranking: PR4>PR3>PR5>PR2>PR1, as presented in Figure 8. Product research and development (PR4) is seen as a challenge in supporting the development of corporate sustainability infrastructure, with a score of 0.4102. The next sub-criteria that received the highest score is the compliance with products and policies (PR3) category, with a weight of 0.3297. Product complaint mechanism (PR5) received a score of 0.1737, being the third most important sub-criteria. Following this, indirect impacts of the product (PR2) reached the fourth position (within Product Responsibility category) with a weight of 0.1321. The fifth most important sub-attribute came from the personal impacts of product use (PR1) with a weight of 0.0952. Then, the first phases of product-innovation processes, as well as decision-making processes, must address a sustainability perspective in order to introduce a sustainability paradigm into the business’s practices. Additionally, organizations must incorporate a long-term perspective when considering sustainability as a strategic asset for businesses [98].

# Transparency and Communication

As shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107. Transparency of general reports (TC4) reached the first position in the Transparency and Communication category, showing a score of 0.4321. Moreover, strategic perspectives after transparency of general reports (TC3) is in the second position, reaching a score of 0.3487. Following, commitments to the community (TC1) and alignment of commitments (TC2) are ranked at the third and fourth.

positions, obtaining a score of 0.2175 and 0.1564, respectively. Finally, ethics and citizenship (TC5) are considered the least influencing sub-criteria with a score of 0.1324. Thus, sustainability supports knowledge creation and sharing, which, in turn, eases communication within organizations. To make a proactive sustainability strategy realistic, Kim and Ji [99] suggested that corporations aiming for a proactive sustainability strategy must consider the communication of a shared vision within an organization and among the company’s stakeholders. When companies communicate their visions related to sustainability, they improve their reputation which increases stakeholders’ interests in such organizations. Moreover, Dyllick and Muff [100] stated that corporate sustainability mission and vision statements should be adopted to convey corporate commitment throughout the corporation. Then, top managers have to consider sustainability goals in the company’s core values in order to align the company’s motivations, strategic goals, and responsibilities related to customers, employees, and society, as well as stakeholders. Companies need to address sustainability due it inspires commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.

# Economics

The outcomes showed the sub-attribute ranking: ECO4>ECO2>ECO6>ECO5> ECO1>ECO3, as seen in Figure 10. Firstly, risks and the management of economic and financial performance (ECO4) has a weight of 0.4932, whereas CSR and sustainability activities expenditure (ECO2) are ranked in the second position with a score of 0.4321. Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development. Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.

Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development.

Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to operational and social resources, skilled personnel, preventive actions, and regulations adherence. The legal compliance with economic and financial aspects (ECO6) and economic and financial statements (ECO5) is considered at the third and fourth positions within the sub-criteria category of economics with a score of 0.2383 and 0.1894, respectively. Lastly, the development and impact of infrastructure investments (ECO1) and economic and financial policy and strategy (ECO3) with a weight of 0.1765 and 0.1634, respectively. Sustainability actions are the basic elements for putting the economic dimension into practice, and these actions consider profitability, financial stability and liquidity, and financial benefits [101]. Therefore, the CSR spending, the management of innovation and technology, knowledge management, collaborations, organizational processes management, and elaboration of sustainability reports are some of the relevant actions towards corporate sustainability [102].

# Environment

Results showed the ranking within the Environmental dimension of corporate sustainability are as follows: ENV1>ENV4>ENV3>ENV2>ENV5, as shown in Figure 11. The highest weight, 0.5321, obtained of sub-criteria within the environment category is initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ENV1). Compliance with environmental regulations (ENV4) reported the second sub-criteria in the row with a weight of 0.4654. Whereas, environmental management and responsibility (ENV3) sub-barrier and commitment, scope, and dissemination of environmental policy (ENV2) are ranked at third and fourth positions, within the environmental sustainability category, presenting a score of 0.3936 and 0.3381, respectively. Finally, environmental cost-saving operations (ENV5) come fifth in the row with a weight of 0.2101. Government regulations have been the primary drivers of a part of corporate sustainability. Literature showed that environmental sustainability provides cost reductions for the businesses, and these reductions are related to the use of energy, raw materials, and water, as well as reducing waste generation. Environmental sustainability improves the company’s reputation for stakeholders and into the market which, in turn, eases acquiring new customers prone to environmental issues. The incorporation of EMS by companies leads to CO2 emission reductions as well as a reduction in pollution [103,104].

# Social

Figure 12 shows the outcomes, ranking the sub-criteria as follows: SOC1>SOC4>SOC5>SOC2>SOC3. The highest sub-attribute of social criteria is the commitment to societal development (SOC1) with a weight of 0.5464. Training employees through in-house programs (SOC4) is ranked at the second position, presenting a score of 0.4821. Companies must train their personnel to work in an integrated way. Additionally, companies must use integration between auditing services and administration support for building stronger relationships with stakeholders. These relations promote efficiency, may save resources, and provide assertiveness amongst personnel.

Whereas commitment to HR development (SOC5) is ranked as the third most important sub-criterium, showing a score of 0.3410. Human resources (HR) have a crucial role in the implementation of sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. Labor relations and with society (SOC2) as well as diversity and equity, supplier management, and resolution of society’s demands (SOC3) are ranked into the fourth and fifth positions, presenting scores of 0.3241 and 0.2146, respectively. Here, we see a strong relationship with suppliers, which emphasizes the need for developing an integrative decision support program for managing the supply chain, taking into account the stakeholders that strategically improve the company’s production processes and balance the supplier sustainability system.

# Natural Environment and Climate:

Under the natural environment and climate change category, results showed in Figure 13 allowed the identification of the following ranking: NEC1>NEC3>NEC2>NEC4. Commitment to climate change (NEC1) is presented as the highest score of sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. Labor relations and with society (SOC2) as well as diversity and equity, supplier management, and resolution of society’s demands (SOC3) are ranked into the fourth and fifth positions, presenting scores of 0.3241 and 0.2146, respectively. Here, we see a strong relationship with suppliers, which emphasizes the need for developing an integrative decision support program for managing the supply chain, taking into account the stakeholders that strategically improve the company’s production processes and balance the supplier sustainability system.

monitoring effective systems. Moreover, climate change is usually considered an important threat in society and nature, more critical than biodiversity loss. Regarding the company’s sustainability performance, the tree planting program (NEC3) is located in the second position with a 0.5241 score. The responsibility and climate change systems (NEC2) and Issues concerning climate change (NEC4) come in at the third and fourth positions within the category with scores of 0.48521 and 0.3581, respectively. A responsibility attributed to businesses regarding environmental crisis mitigation is crucial, due to these organizations possessing greater experience than any other group in society when dealing with such kind of problems. The organization should develop an environment towards a climate-friendly perspective, since climate changes are affecting societies and will affect, as a consequence, companies’ revenues. In this scenario, tougher legislation and binding treaties are needed [106].

# Pandemic

Under the Pandemic (PAN) category, results show the sub-attributes in the following order of importance: PAN1>PAN4>PAN2>PAN3. An emergency response plan (PAN1) obtained the highest weight 0.7646. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, whose major consequences are expected to be revealed in the long-term, results provided a deeper analysis of business risks, which can help organizations to plan accordingly. The organizations should incorporate an emergency plan in order to respond to the pandemic (PAN1), which is considered a community-led initiative based on different scenarios for testing the resilience and the plans addressing the several impacts of the crisis.

Following this, the highest sub-criteria identified is the modification in the number of working hours and social distancing (PAN4) with a weight of 0.6752. Environmental dimensions are the focus of companies and, for this research, organizations are taking several actions to fight the coronavirus outbreak, especially with social distancing and the modification in employee working hours. Organizations should also dedicate focus on their supply chains and on social innovations issues that may result from this pandemic. Results also showed that the JIT as well as lean delivery (PAN2) obtained 0.6241 weight and are in the third position within this category. The pandemic caused by the coronavirus emphasized vulnerabilities related to the overreliance of JIT and lean delivery systems. Additionally, there is a concern about whether JIT systems can contribute to the overall efficiency of resources and waste, in order to transform them into environmentally sound [85].

The growing smarter logistics systems are witnessed by organizations, specifically the consideration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies applications, and reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products. Some possible applications of IoT and reverse logistics are addressed. In the first example, monitoring where electronics and appliances and their components are may ease their retrieval and allocation at local levels. As a second example, companies may benefit by using intermediary storage/depots instead of using extensive transportation of processed goods, also favoring reverse logistics. The fourth sub-criteria under the COVID-19 pandemic category, commitment to employee safety (PAN3), has a weight of 0.5354.

Investments in renewable energy projects lead to greater engagement by the local community related to renewable energy development. Thus, renewable energy projects can empower the community and enrich their social capital. In addition, an expected outcome is an increase in energy efficiency within a community and reducing energy costs. Organizations can improve sustainability by reducing material waste, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.

# 5. Conclusions

This study’s goal is to propose a corporate sustainability framework that is more resilient than prior models and, to rank relevant criteria to the degree that could help develop a corporate sustainability model. This study is grounded in previous studies and showed the interconnected relations of sustainability and the relevance of considering stakeholders [107]. In meeting the objectives of this study we have multiple contributions to the field of sustainable business practices; (1) to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria as part of a new integrated framework; (2) provide a methodology to help organize and understand a dynamic context for sustainable business practices; (3) extend our understanding of social sustainability by also exploring and finding new insights regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

We were able to identify several sustainability attributes from literature, which allowed for an analysis of prior studies and the identification of sustainability attributes, which is also supported by experts’ assessments. As a result, 45 sustainability sub-criteria were developed and ranked according to the main nine categories of Corporate Governance, Transparency and Communication, Product Responsibility, Environment, Social, Economics, Natural Environment and Climate Change, Energy Consumption and Saving and, for the very first time, we have included Pandemic as an important criterion in the development of corporate sustainability model. These criteria help to develop a new integrative framework of social sustainability. Additional contributions of this study include the application of a Fuzzy Delphi and FAHP methodology, and the computation of nine main criteria and 45 sub-criteria. These criteria provide a more dynamic assessment of the interrelated social dimensions that have in the past been looked at individually and as environmental impacts of firms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new insights include the Pandemic, along with Economic and Corporate Governance are top-ranked criteria to focus on improving corporate sustainability practices. Whereas, emergency response plan, social distance and modification in the number of working hours, commitment to climate changes, and JIT and lean delivery emerged in the top-ranked sub-criteria.

The outcomes of our work lead us to call for more action from decision-makers and policymakers as sustainability provides an integration opportunity with dynamic social benefits. Moreover, scholars also can consider relevant criteria from literature, and building on this research when combining insights from experts and develop a new, more integrated, corporate sustainability model. The research in this study also contributes to developing theory with contemporary approaches for decision-making analysis to show corporate sustainability theory can and should include more social sustainability practices. When doing so, we hope the efforts of both researchers and practitioners will be able to find more dynamic relationships between practices, firm performance, and resiliency to overcome future pandemics. Our results also provide insights to scholars wanting to further develop theories considering Multiple Management Standards (MMSs), the Stakeholder Theory [108], Integrated Management [109], Integrated Management Systems (IMS), and possibilities for a new theory such as a social sustainability-based view (SBV) of the firm.

The methods used in this study support decision-making in a powerful and relatively simple way. This useful perspective addresses decision-makers and researchers dealing with resource allocation or project prioritization. These methods may be applied toward further replications by future studies. The methods described in this study help in measuring strategic goals as a set of scored criteria for determining project selection. Multi-criterion decision-making methodologies have proven to be useful in the application for manufacturing sectors. We can foresee the need for more work with these types of firms using the application of MCDA in complex interdisciplinary and social sustainability problems. We recommend future studies include developing FAHP techniques in combination with other analysis opportunities in an integrated system, supply chains, cities, and even entire countries aiming to tackle grand challenges, for example, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Finally, this research is the first of its kind considering the development of an integrated social sustainability model with social sustainability criteria that include the pandemic and COVID-19. Outcomes of this study can help organizations to consider the most suitable programs and systems for advancing corporate sustainability while also considering stakeholders and social sustainability. As managerial implications, we see sustainable development enabling companies to integrate audits, engage personnel, and optimizing companies’ processes and resource allocation. Social sustainability is dynamic, not easily understood, and can be disruptive if not taken into account as part of corporate social sustainability at every level of the firm.

This study presents some limitations. We address the limitation related to the developed models based on experts’ assessments. By choosing this approach, it is assumed that bias will always occur in the process. Future applications of this approach may include a diversified set of experts and managers from companies that may be more impacted by systems implementations. Another limitation is concerning data availability. Managers involved in an MCDA process may have limited access to data concerning all criteria or even the entire multinational company as a consequence of a lack of integrated information. Moreover, these issues can be solved by careful consideration of practitioners involved in the decision-making process when realizing that inputs are qualitative, in nature, and the time needed for options assessments. Then, the criteria and outcomes should be revisited when assessing corporate sustainability performance over time.
